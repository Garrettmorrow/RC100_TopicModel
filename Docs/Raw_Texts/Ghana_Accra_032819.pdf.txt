Dear friends,

I  am  delighted  to  share  with  you  the  City  of  Accra’s  Resilience  Strategy,  the 
culmination  of  three  years  of  rigorous  research  and  exploration,  extensive 
stakeholder engagement, and widespread commitment. This tremendous milestone 
marks the first of its kind for our city and only the second in West Africa!

Accra’s  Resilience  Strategy  represents  the  dawn  of  a  critical  moment  in  our 
Nation’s history, and our City’s future. You will find in the strategy a shared identity 
which celebrates our rich cultural heritage while capitalising on opportunities to 
become a better, stronger, more resilient Accra.

Accra’s  Resilience  Strategy  offers  a  roadmap  and  an  action  plan  towards 
becoming  the  city  that  we  have  long  desired;  a  city  that  is  poised  to  anticipate, 
mitigate,  and  respond  to  whatever  acute  or  chronic  challenges  that  we  may  face 
now  and  in  the  future.  It  positions  us  towards  becoming  a  city  that  values  and 
exemplifies  data-driven  policy  development  and  decision-making;  a  city  that  is 
capable  of  transforming  the  challenges  with  which  we  have  long  grappled  into 
new  opportunities;  an  inclusive  city  that  cares  for  and  is  accountable  to  all  of  its 
residents, be they young, old, or vulnerable.

The  United  Nations  estimates  that  more  than  half  of  the  world’s  population 
currently  resides  in  urban  centres,  a  number  expected  to  reach  68%  by  2050. 
Projections  show  the  fastest  rates  of  urbanisation  occurring  in  the  developing 
world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Accra’s Resilience Strategy demonstrates 
our City’s visionary role and establishes us as regional leaders in addressing the 
challenges  of  rapid  urbanisation  that  we,  like  many  of  our  neighbouring  cities, 
face.  We  hope  that  this  strategy  will  foster  greater  inter-  and  intra-regional 
collaborations  with  our  neighbours.  The  implementation  of  Accra’s  Resilience 
Strategy will enable us to build a truly resilient city; one that is smart, sustainable, 
and which anticipates and plans for different shocks and stresses, come what may. 

I  would  like  to  applaud  the  efforts  of  the  Accra  Resilience  Team,  our  partners  at 
100  Resilient  Cities,  and  the  residents  of  Accra,  without  whom  this  tremendous 
undertaking  would  not  be  possible.  I  look  forward  to  our  continued  partnership 
towards building a stronger, safer, more resilient City of Accra for the benefit of all 
her residents!

Mayor Mohammed. Adjei Sowah

Our vision for Accra is “A smart, sustainable, and resilient city 
that anticipates and plans for shocks, rather than reacts to them� 
We will transform the city’s ongoing stresses into opportunities: 
by embracing informality as an engine of growth, designing

accountability, and transparency�” 

Accra’s Resilience Strategy is organised into: 

3 pillars, or strategic

LETTER FROM THE RESILIENCE OFFICE

LETTER FROM 100 RESILIENT CITIES

It was with great excitement that Accra joined 100 Resilient Cities in 2014.

Our hope and ambition were to draw on the tremendous support of the global net-
work, to create a pathway by which to better serve and meet the needs of all res-
idents  for  a  more  resilient  future.  The  City  of  Accra’s  aim  is  to  become  a  model 
for urban development in Ghana and the sub-region by offering better livelihoods, 
increasing economic growth, improving urban land-use systems, reducing pollution, 
and ensuring resilience to climate change and other stresses.

For  Accra,  building  resilience  means  bringing  together  systems,  institutions,  and 
all  the  resources  with  which  we  are  endowed  —  to  enable  the  city  to  prepare  for 
and mitigate the effects of climate change and become more responsive to acute and 
slow-burning disasters, especially in vulnerable communities.

Today  we  are  proud  of  the  journey  we  have  made  in  developing  our  Resilience 
Strategy,  which  will  serve  as  a  holistic  roadmap  and  which  clearly  illustrates  the 
necessity of collaboration in building resilience. This Strategy could not have been 
completed without the support of our stakeholders and city partners who recognised 
the importance of this initiative and drove it with passion. We equally recognise the 
hard work and commitment of the Accra Resilience Team.

Now we can collectively begin implementing the initiatives presented in the pages 
that follow, which have the potential to positively affect all who call Accra home. For 
example, integrating informal waste collectors into the current waste management 
plan while boosting the availability of waste transfer sites, will help to ensure that 
collection rates increase. It will, at the same time, serve as a source of sustainable 
income  for  individuals  in  the  informal  sector;  their  employment  will  be  effectively 
regulated  by  the  City  Authorities.  Through  this  process,  we  can  improve  the 
livelihoods of residents as well as achieve the goal of making Accra the cleanest city 
in Africa.

It is our deepest hope that our citizens will take advantage of the opportunity to con-
tribute and take ownership of this strategy so that they can share in our collective 
pursuit of building a resilient city. Together with our partners and stakeholders and 
all who call the City of Accra home, let us come together to build an Accra that we 
can LIVE IN & LOVE.

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to congratulate Mayor Adjei 
Sowah  and  the  Accra  Metropolitan  Assembly  (AMA)  on  the  release  of  Accra’s 
Resilience  Strategy,  a  major  milestone  for  the  city  and  for  our  partnership.  As 
the  second  strategy  to  be  published  in  West  Africa  with  100RC,  this  ambitious 
document paves the way for leadership from Accra on African urban resilience.

Rapid  growth  in  Accra  presents  a  host  of  complex  challenges  for  the  city’s 
residents and administration. Yet buoyed by the AMA’s vision for a smart, resilient, 
and sustainable city, this ambitious strategy lays the groundwork for transforming 
such shocks and stresses into long-term opportunities. 

In  the  following  pages,  we  see  a  clear  and  thoughtful  framework  for  addressing 
increasingly urgent urban trends in Accra — from improving the city’s processes 
for planning and engagement, to upgrading infrastructure and delivery of services 
such  as  energy,  waste  management,  and  transportation  in  both  the  formal  and 
informal  sectors.  The  three  overarching  pillars  of  the  Resilience  Strategy  are 
grounded by eight goals and twenty-seven initiatives — that are not just actionable 
but also have the potential to produce multiple benefits. For example, in a city with 
high traffic congestion and pollution levels, the strategy proposes integrating the 
vast  network  of  trotros  into  the  city’s  nascent  Bus  Rapid  Transit  (BRT)  system 
and  upgrading  vehicles  to  lower  Green  House  Gas  (GHG)  emission  rates.  With 
dedicated support from the AMA and global partners, this project has the potential 
to reimagine mass transit in Accra.

This innovative Strategy would not be possible without the tireless efforts of the 
Resilience Team and various departments of the AMA, which lent their support 
to  this  process  throughout  a  broad  and  inclusive  engagement  period.  In  the  last 
months,  we  have  seen  the  team  set  the  stage  for  the  successful  implementation 
of  this  document.  By  developing  and  deepening  strategic  partnerships  with 
international  financial  institutions,  as  well  as  regional  and  domestic  institutions, 
throughout the strategy’s development, AMA will be able to galvanise the backing 
needed to sow transformative change. 

Through this work, and under the vision of Mayor Adjei Sowah, the city is poised 
to confront some of its most intractable resilience challenges. In that way, the hard 
work is just beginning. 100 Resilient Cities is eager to be a resource and partner as 
Accra continues on its resilience journey, implementing and bringing this Resilience 
Strategy to life.

Sincerely,
 
Michael Berkowitz
President, 100 Resilient Cities

50% threshold where more people live 
in urban than in non-urban areas�1 As the 
country’s capital and its most influential 
city, this trend presents Accra with both 
developmental opportunities and pressing 
challenges that need to be carefully 
managed� It is for this reason that the Accra 
Metropolitan Assembly embarked on the 
journey of mainstreaming resilience within 
City governance�

A History of Urban Resilience in Accra 

15th Century
Migrants from present-day 
Nigeria, Lower Banks of the Volta 
River, and Western Ghana begin 
to migrate to Accra and establish 
a prominent trading centre.

1877
The British Colonial Authority 
transfers the seat of Government 
to Accra, paving the way to later 
become the capital city of Ghana 
and the capital of the Greater 
Accra Region.

May 4, 1986
Flooding in Kwame Nkrumah 
Circle, Aladjo, Avenor, Odawna, 
among other areas, results in 3 
lives lost and damage to P&T 
switching equipment. The 
damage totals 3.6 billion cedis.

June 22, 1939
An earthquake in Accra claims 
the lives of 17 people. Low 
casualty count due to the high 
number of people outdoors at the 
time, along with a much smaller 
urban population.

March 6, 1957
Ghana gains independence from 
Britain. Inaugural president Dr. 
Kwame Nkrumah declares Accra 
as the country’s †rst city in 1961.

June 28, 2001
Heavy “ooding in Accra, the 
worst since July 1995, a”ects 
Madina, Achimota, Dzorwulu, 
Avenor, Santa Maria and Adabra-
ka O™cial Town – submerging 
portions of the city and damaging 
many houses and structures.

July 5, 1995
Heavy “ooding in Accra, particu-
larly in low-lying areas of the 
metropolis, a”ects many 
commuters and vehicles. An 
inundated Achimota Volta River 
Authority substation causes 
power failures.

November 1, 2011
Heavy “ooding in Accra results in 
14 deaths and 43,087 displaced or 
a”ected residents.

June 3, 2015
Heavy “oods in Accra a”ect 
52,622 people. A †re explosion at 
the GOIL station near Kwame 
Nkrumah Interchange, being 
used as a temporary shelter, 
results in 150 casualties.

July 15, 2015
Fire destroys over 200 structures 
in Abuja, a slum in Accra. The 
same location was gutted by †re 
in 2013, razing several wooden 
structures to the ground. 

2015
Ghana experiences 159 days of 
blackouts; entire neighborhoods 
switch o” in an instant with no 
public load-shedding schedule 
previously publicised. 

September 2016
Accra institutes a polluter pays 
policy where private companies 
are contracted and regulated by 
the AMA to provide waste 
collection services to citizens,

The Greater Accra Region, within which the Accra Metropolitan 
Area is located, accounted for 17% of Ghana’s GDP in 20144� The 
country’s GDP growth averaged 7�8% between 2005-20135 and in 
2018 was one of Africa’s fastest growing economies6� From a small 
Ga fishing village, Accra has grown to become a dominant urban 
centre due to its concentration of assets, economic activities, and 
government�  

Today, Accra is on the move — economic growth is robust, 

inefficient transportation system, high cost of living and 

foreign  investment  is  growing,  and  an  expanding  urban

also  saddled  with  enormous  challenges  in  sanitation 

and  the  environment,  traffic,  growing  slums,  poverty, 

and  unemployment,  among  others.  Urbanisation  has 

far  outpaced  planning  and  available  services  and 

infrastructure, with implications for the living conditions 

of  residents.  Low-income  communities,  in  particular, 

find  themselves  living  in  informal  and  overcrowded 

housing with limited or no access to urban services. This 

haphazard urban development represents a challenge for 

the  city.  Furthermore,  Accra  faces  a  number  of  shocks 

and  stresses  that  heavily  affect  the  city.  Some  of  these 

shocks  include  fires,  floods,  disease  outbreaks,  building 

collapse,  and  earthquakes.  The  stresses  include  ageing 

infrastructure,  poor  waste  management  and  sanitation, 

26

What are shocks and stresses?

Shocks are typically considered single 
event disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, 
and floods� 

Stresses are factors that weaken the 
fabric of a city on a daily or reoccurring 
basis, such as poor waste management, an 
inefficient transportation system, or high 
unemployment�

Accra’s Priority Stresses

Stresses weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis.

1

High cost of living

The individual and aggregate costs 
of food, rent, transport, and utilities 
make affordability the biggest 
challenge facing Accra’s population.

2

Inefficient Transportation 
System 

While numerous public 
transportation options exist, they 
are often unreliable and unsafe. 

3

Poor Waste 
Management

This is attributable to limited waste and 
sanitation management infrastructure, 
poor education on and behavior in 
waste disposal, and extremely low 
enforcement of regulations.

4

Poor Sanitation and 
Water Scarcity

At a household level, a lack of 
adequate and safe sanitation and 
water translates directly into 
increased health challenges, with 
diarrhea and other health 
complications a regular part of 
peoples’ lives. This indirectly 
reduces time for studying, 
employment, and leisure, leading to 
a stark decrease in quality of life.

 Stresses are not listed in order of severity or magnitude and are based on analysis of stakeholder engagement.

29

Accra’s Priority Shocks

Shocks as sudden, sharp events that threaten a city.

Dumping of waste in drains 
results in choked drains, which 
reduces drain efficiency and 
leads to flooding. 

The need for an upgraded 
drainage system is also rarely 
addressed, as is the inconsistent 
application of land use policies 
which also compound flooding 
problems.

Risks of fires are aggravated by electrical
faults, illegal power connections, and lack of 
enforcement of proper wiring by electricians. 
Recent cases of mass fires include market 
fires recorded from 2014 through 2015. 
Fire-fighting infrastructure including installed 
hydrants, fire-tenders and other fire 
equipment are in dire need of upgrades.

Cholera has dominated the charts in recent times 
when it comes to epidemics within the city. Yet it is 
not the only disease that impacts people’s lives. 
Digestive diseases, bacterial infections, and other 
infectious and communicable diseases are more 
easily spread in Accra due to the infrastructure 
challenges related to sanitation and water 
management.

Poor application of building

Earthquakes

Accra sits on an earthquake fault line. The last 
substantial earthquake occurred in 1939, 
claiming 17 lives. Presently, most of the areas 
vulnerable to earthquake impact sit outside of 
the control of the AMA but would however 
look directly to the AMA for support in the 
event of an occurrence—placing high demands 
on an already resource-constrained city. 

Shocks are not listed in order of severity or magnitude and are based on analysis of stakeholder engagement.

Vision

Accra is a smart, sustainable, and 
resilient city that anticipates and plans 
for shocks, rather than reacts to them� 
We will transform the city’s ongoing 
stresses into opportunities: by embracing 
informality as an engine of growth, 
designing infrastructure to improve 
our natural and built environments, and 
optimising our resources and systems for 
greater efficiency, accountability, and 
transparency�

Whilst Accra is the premier economic centre of Ghana, significant 
challenges persist that Accra needs to be able to manage in order to be  
a truly resilient city� 

Our vision will be achieved through a Resilience Strategy that seeks to 
make it more feasible, safe and convenient for all in Accra to access jobs, 
opportunities, facilities, and infrastructure� The AMA is well-positioned to 
address the challenge of enhancing resilience, through pursuing a number 
of initiatives which address those shocks and stresses that seem to serve 
as a stumbling block for our city� There is strong commitment from the 
City Authorities and allied Ministries, Departments, Agencies, as well as 
development partners to work collaboratively� The rapid urbanisation that 
Accra is experiencing should be seen as an opportunity: it highlights the pull 
of the city as an engine of economic growth and an important gateway into 
West Africa� 

Ongoing efforts by the AMA are already contributing to strengthened 
resilience� Some of these are included or referenced in the pages that 
follow, such as the Accra Road Safety Strategy, Sustainable Greening and 
Beautification of Accra Project, Clean Accra Project, waste segregation in 
schools throughout Accra, and the distribution of reduced-price household 
toilets� In addition to building on this current work, transformative change 
in Accra will require doing things differently as well as focusing on catalysts 
in a collaborative way� The goals and initiatives contained in this Resilience 
Strategy will help Accra address her shocks and stresses� Most importantly, 
these goals and initiatives highlight the need for a long-term vision for the 
city that takes into consideration projected population increase, climate 
change adaptation, and unanticipated challenges�

A City that takes an integrated 
approach to infrastructure 
planning and service provision 
to account for changing climate 
patterns, economic trends, and 
population growth�

42

43

Accra is growing, yet investment in infrastructure development lags behind� 
This first pillar outlines an integrated approach to infrastructure planning and 
service provision to account for changing climate patterns, economic trends, and 
population growth� These include addressing challenges related to inadequate 
transportation and mobility options; management of waste, sanitation, and 
flooding; and a growing demand for electricity which can outstrip supply� 

“Building resilience in the City 
of Accra is not an option but the 
option. In the face of increasing 
physical threats from flooding to 
terrorism, the City of Accra does 
not have any choice but to develop 
and implement strategies to match 
the evolving risk profile and to 
reduce fragility to disasters.” 

- Mr� Kenneth Owusu,  
National Development 
Planning Commission

Further confounding these vulnerabilities is the ever-
growing threat of climate change, rapid population 
growth, and a fast-growing economy but unequal 
income gap� To address and mitigate these risks, we 
believe infrastructure planning and delivery should 
incorporate both systems and resilient thinking, 
anticipating — as opposed to reacting to — the 
shocks and stresses that threaten our city� We must 
ensure that our infrastructure and service delivery 
can adapt to new and unforeseen challenges in 
the future� Benefits generated that contribute to 
individual, community, or systems resilience — what 
are known as co-benefits — must be identified 

and supported� This will enable us to optimise the social, environmental, and 
economic impact of our investments in infrastructure and service provision� 

By undertaking the following initiatives, we hope that Accra will become a 
city that not only plans for today’s residents and current context, but one that 
anticipates future growth, challenges, and is prepared for future unknown social, 
environmental, and physical risks that our city may face�

Ghana’s Decentralisation Act of 2017, strives to improve financial and resource 
management, increase efficiency, and ensure judicious use of public assets� 
Though the Decentralisation Act may limit AMA’s geographic coverage, this 
is unlikely to decrease population flows into and out of AMA’s jurisdiction for 
official, recreational, or commercial purposes by residents and non-residents 
alike� Given the intersectionality of the proposed investments in infrastructure 
and service provision, this approach will require greater cross- jurisdictional 
cooperation between AMA and the surrounding MMDAs to ensure adequate 
provisions for both residents and non-residents�

What is Systems Thinking? 

Systems thinking is an approach to problem solving that 
attempts to balance holistic thinking and reductionist thinking 
to allow people to better understand complex problems and 
effectively make change� To understand systems thinking an 
iceberg is a useful metaphor� 

About 90% of an iceberg lies below the surface, underneath 
the water� This part of the iceberg is not easily visible� The 
visible tip of the iceberg is equivalent to the events that 
happen in a system� Underneath those events are patterns of 
systems behaviour, systems structures, and mental models that 
need to be understood in order to change the system�

GOAL 

1.1

Upgrade transport & trading 
infrastructure to ensure systems  
are safe, robust and inclusive

Accra is a major regional trading and transportation hub� Rapid urbanisation and 
its attendant traffic congestion, as well as limited attention paid to designated 
spaces for commerce, have resulted in an inability to meet the population’s 
transportation needs and have led to stymied economic growth� As a result, many 
users of Accra’s transport and trading infrastructure face safety, security, and 
accessibility issues� 

For instance, many of Accra’s residents walk to get to school or work, to access 
healthcare, and for shopping� Over 47% of trips to work and 72% of trips to 
school are completed by walking�13 For residents using motorised transport, 
trotros — an informal and loosely regulated transportation network of owner-
operated mini busses — are their primary means of commuting to work and 
for leisure�14 Transportation policies at both national and local levels have 
nonetheless largely focused on the realisation of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) 
system� Despite an estimated US $46 million invested by the Government of 
Ghana and donor partners to launch the BRT,15 the system remains partially 
developed and underutilised� 

Accra’s rapidly growing population requires an efficient, readily accessible, 
safe, and affordable multi-modal transportation system� A robust transportation 
system that is capable of withstanding sudden shocks would positively impact 
economic development in Accra, both in times of crises and stability� It would 
help to improve businesses’ ability to provide goods and services as well as 
people’s ability to access services, education, and employment� 

Relatedly, one of the limitations to economic growth are insecure environments16 
for both business and customers in Accra’s many markets� Markets are crucial 
sites of economic activity in Accra� Positively impacting economic development 
and resilience for the city will require addressing the insecurity of these 
environments for both traders and customers� A particular focus on integration 
and inclusiveness will be critical in upgrading both the public transportation 
system and Accra’s markets so that there is a shared sense of ownership amongst 
the many relevant stakeholders and an ability to coordinate efforts across 
multiple institutions in order to catalyse multiple benefits� 

The initiatives that follow embrace new methods of creating a more robust 
system that will serve all segments of society and contribute to boosting the 
economy of the region�

Redesign major crossings at junctions to enhance 
pedestrian safety and optimise for multiple users 

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE 

Since  the  introduction  of  the  automobile,  cities  and 

towns  have  experienced  major  challenges  in  relation  to 

pedestrian  safety.  In  most  parts  of  Accra,  pedestrians 

are at frequent risk of injury and death. According to the 

National Road Safety Commission, in 2015 there were 13 

traffic  fatalities  per  100,000  residents  in  Accra;  64%  of 

which were incurred by pedestrians.18  With the increase 

in  Accra’s  population,  number  of  motor  vehicle,  and 

traffic, there has been a surge in competition for the use 

of  Accra’s  streets,  which  function  as  important  market 

spaces  as  well  as  transportation  corridors.  Despite  the 

dangers  faced  by  pedestrians,  transport  and  planning 

policy  in  Ghana  to  date  has  not  adequately  addressed 

their needs. 

INITIATIVE IN BRIEF

The  goal  of  this  initiative  is  to  reduce  the  exposure  to 

traffic risks by improving pedestrian spaces and reducing 

fatalities in Accra. This will be done through: 

•  collaborating  with  partner  agencies  to  redesign  high 

fatality intersections to acknowledge the needs of mul-

tiple users and multiple functions;

•  building  on  Accra’s  Pedestrian  Safety  Action  Plan 

where  critical  intersections  within  the  city  with  high 

fatalities in Accra have been identified; and 

•  testing  on  a  pilot  basis  the  alternative  corridor  and 

intersection designs and interventions identified at the 

‘CoLab’  on  Safe  and  Inclusive  Streets,  hosted  by  100 

Resilient Cities and academic partners.19   

Improving the design of these intersections has multiple 

resilience benefits, including: 

•   capitalising on the health benefits of walking; 

•  improving  connections  to  economic  opportunities 

and livelihoods activities, given that 47.4% of people in 

Accra walk to work;

•  acknowledging  the  multiple  users  (including  street 

vendors) and the multiple functions for which they use 

these intersections; and

•  promoting  effective  coordination  with  other  govern-

ment bodies, as this is an area where multiple govern-

ment  bodies  at  both  the  national  and  municipal  level 

play a role.

1.2

Design and adapt infrastructure 
to maximise co-benefits and 
simultaneously address Accra’s 
flooding, waste, sanitation, and 
climate challenges

Flooding is one of Accra’s greatest urban challenges, and one of the most 
critical threats to its resilience� While Accra has a longstanding history of 
flooding, recent floods have grown more frequent and more destructive� 
Between 1955 and 1997, flooding destroyed about 150 million cedis worth of 
property (US $30 million), rendering 10,000 people homeless, with over 100 
lives lost� More recently, the consequences of flooding have grown in severity 
as Accra has expanded� Between 2000 and 2012, 83 lives were lost as a result 
of floods and 178,750 displaced from their homes, with damages adding up 
to an approximate US $43�7 million�20 The 2015 Accra flood was particularly 
destructive, affecting 52,622 residents and claiming 150 lives following an 
explosion at a flooded fuel station at the Kwame Nkrumah Circle� 

Accra’s low-lying topography, its high levels of seasonal rainfall, and its 
vulnerability to coastal inundation and storm surges contribute to the 
city’s flooding challenges� Insufficient drainage networks and poor waste 
management (leading to illegal dumping of refuse in drains) serve to worsen 
outcomes� Flooding, waste, and sanitation challenges cannot be tackled 
in isolation� Improper waste management is one of the most significant 
contributors to flooding in Accra; the city’s natural and man-made water 
drainage systems are often clogged with solid waste, blocking water-flow 
and causing both short- and long-term flooding as well as spreading water-
borne diseases� 

Waste management — including collection, transportation and disposal 
— continues to be a major challenge for the AMA� In order to avoid the 
dangerous interaction between poor waste management, flooding, and 
disease epidemics, the AMA will develop holistic, cross-cutting solutions that 
capitalise on these interconnected challenges� We will pursue innovations in 
waste management that also provide flood management benefits and help 
mitigate GHG emissions, all the while engaging and involving citizens and 
local experts� 

Climate change will further exacerbate Accra’s vulnerability to shocks and 
stresses� The AMA is acutely aware of expected increases in the frequency 
and intensity of rainfall, rainwater flow, and coastal flooding� We will pursue 
solutions that ensure our built and natural environments are prepared for 
the future�

As Ghana’s economy has grown, so too has the demand for 
electricity� Electricity regulation and distribution is managed by 
the central government and remains outside the remit of the Accra 
Metropolitan Assembly (AMA); however, as a City we have a crucial 
role to play in supporting governmental efforts to ensure that the

including supporting the enabling environment for the production 
of renewable energy locally� The Accra Metropolis alone consumes 
approximately 10% of the total megawatts generated in the country24 
and was heavily affected by national load shedding in 2015�

Ensuring access to reliable and affordable energy is complex and 
requires interventions focused on policy, regulation, technology, and

to proactively serve citizens 
with greater accountability and

Like many cities globally, the city of Accra aspires to build and support healthy 
and resilient urban communities; where residents thrive and can realise their full 
potential� The resources available to Accra to achieve such an ambitious goal 
are however limited� Therefore, accountability and transparency in resource 
allocation and outcome measurement are particularly crucial for advancing this 
agenda� Creating a culture of accountability and transparency will require the 
collective efforts of the AMA, residents, and a broad stakeholder community� 

“Citizen engagement is important 
to the extent that it ensures 
involvement, participation, 
ownership and buy-in to the city’s 
agenda.” 

- Mr� Abdul Mujeeb Salifu, People’s 
Dialogue on Human Settlements

Our city must embark upon a new social contract 
to improve residents’ trust in the spirit of civic 
partnership� We believe resident engagement and 
feedback are important elements for increasing 
accountability of the AMA and service providers, that 
will warrant greater accountability for all� Engendering 
trust between Accra’s residents and the AMA will 
require strengthening our existing assets: our staff 
capacity, revenue mobilisation, and the collection, 
deployment, and analysis of data for evidence-based 
decision-making� 

Increasing engagement between the AMA and its people is a core part of shaping 
Accra’s resilience� Doing so will lead to greater citizen support for, willingness to 
invest in (through taxes and rates), and use of AMA’s programs and development 
efforts� Expanded engagement with citizens will also allow for better data 
collection to ensure that the AMA’s investments are meeting the specific needs of 
the community� 

As one of the more established MMDAs, the Decentralisation Act positions 
the AMA as a leader and facilitator towards improving cross-jurisdictional 
collaboration, managing new and existing resources, and promoting transparency 
with newly formed neighbouring municipalities� To this end, Accra’s Resilience 
Office is poised to work with neighbouring MMDAs to effectively and efficiently 
leverage limited existing and emerging resources to optimise planning efforts 
which promote multiple benefits — thereby improving municipal service delivery 
for all, especially to our city’s most vulnerable populations�

INITIATIVEGOAL 

2.1

Improve the use of data for sound 
long-term integrated planning and 
reflective decision-making

To capitalise on the opportunities associated with urbanisation, and 
given the limited resources within the AMA, we recognise the need to 
be strategic about investments made across different sectors� 

To achieve this goal and ensure sustainable development, the City of 
Accra seeks to deepen its collection, management, and use of data, 
as well as its ability to engage in data-driven planning processes� 
A data-driven city is better able to optimise resources, monitor 
outcomes, and most importantly, make informed decisions� Data 
leads to insights; and we can turn those insights into plans, decisions, 
and actions that support us in achieving our objective of making 
Accra a more resilient city� Becoming smart with our data is a key 
part of our path towards becoming more resilient� We aim to make 
the use of data and strategic planning integral to the City’s efforts 
around addressing its key shocks and stresses, including inadequate 
transportation, poor waste and sanitation management, and seismic 
risks� In taking a data-driven approach and prioritising planning in 
these areas, the AMA will be able to take an integrated approach to 
service delivery and decision-making�

INITIATIVEINSPIRATION  
Travel SMART Programme in Cape Town, South Africa27 

Launch a research and data collection program on 
transport, to holistically understand commuting patterns 
and transportation trends

12

PILLAR 2           GOAL 2�1

CHALLENGE: In Cape Town, a rise in vehicle 
ownership and usage, particularly of single 
occupancy vehicles, has led to increased 
traffic congestion, resulting in longer peak 
periods and lengthier commutes throughout 
the city.

INTERVENTION: In 2011, the City of Cape 

Town piloted the Travel SMART programme, 
originally known as the Employee Trip 
Reduction Programme, to improve mobility 
and reduce congestion. Partnering with the 
city’s private sector, the programme assisted 
large employers in fostering behaviour 
change among their staff toward more 
sustainable methods of urban transport. Seven 
participating organisations received tailored 
trip reduction plans, establishing target goals 
and possible incentives. Each plan was based 
on a thorough analysis of the organisation’s 
background, core business functions, 
employee demographic and volume, and 
a review of existing facilities, policies, and 
procedures relevant to the transit program. 

OUTCOMES: Intended to encourage large 

employers and their staff to move towards 
sustainable transport behaviour, the Travel 
SMART Programme encouraged the reduction 
in single occupancy vehicle use through a 
variety of initiatives and projects. Specifically, 
the programme aims to reduce: the use of 
single occupancy vehicles, vehicle emissions, 
costs for commuters, and road congestion. 

KEY LEARNINGS: This case study demonstrates 

how the City of Cape Town municipal 
government convened a group of employers 
to align on mobility challenges and worked 
toward collective action. An internal 
evaluation of Cape Town’s Travel SMART 
Programme highlighted a series of key 
lessons: 

•  Corporate transit initiatives should be 

managed by external transportation engineers 
to avoid municipal bureaucratic and political 
barriers; 

•  Corporations should financially contribute to 

the planning and implementation of transit 
initiatives to incentivise engagement and 
interest; 

•  Programs should be implemented within 
realistic time frames tailored to targeted 
corporations; 

•  Legislation mandating some degree of 

participation is necessary to ensure project 
sustainability; 

•  Programs must be appropriately staffed 

with sufficient capacity to ensure long-term 
viability; 

•  A clear line of communication needs to be 

established to ensure corporations understand 
their programmatic roles and responsibilities; 

•  Programs must be regularly evaluated, and 

surveys of corporate staff should be done in 
a positive manner which encourages a high 
level of participation.

2.2

Foster better citizen engagement 
to improve collaboration between 
citizens and City Authorities

Currently residents’ willingness and ability to engage with the 
AMA is made challenging by a lack of transparency and trust, 
limitations in effective communication systems, difficulty in accessing 
information, and poor planning of engagement efforts� Building a 
more resilient Accra requires pro-active and extensive collaboration 
and cooperation between individuals, civil society, businesses, 
institutions, and city authorities� This will require open and interactive 
communication between the AMA and citizens, and help build the 
public’s trust in local government and promote accountability, 
engagement, and collaboration� Improving engagement will lead 
to greater citizen support for, and use of, AMA’s programs and 
development efforts� It will also help the AMA to support citizens 
during periods of shocks and stresses, like floods and other natural 
disasters� 

The AMA will strive to support effective civic engagement 
through participatory methods (e�g� bringing together politicians, 
policymakers, residents, and experts to actively participate in the 
formulation of ideas and to drive a sense of ownership and inclusion); 
guaranteeing an inclusive approach that gathers inputs from a 
wide range of stakeholders; ensuring ongoing engagement with 
continuous feedback loops� This will pave the way for all content, 
process, and information to be transparent and accessible, with clear 
objectives and expectations�

Citizen Engagement in Thiruvananthapuram, India29 
RELEVANT TO INITIATIVE NO� 16  

CHALLENGE: India’s Department of Information 

OUTCOMES: The success of the 

Technology (DoIT) works with local 
governments to expand ways of connecting 
with citizens using ICT and e-governance 
practices. In the early 2000s, part of their 
program included a strong focus on call 
centre implementation, to expand people’s 
access to critical information and government 
services.

INTERVENTION: Together with the DoIT, 

Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala 
State, launched a one-stop integrated citizen 
service centre in 1999. The municipality made 
use of a Citizen Call Centre (CCC) to provide 
information related to citizens’ transactions 
and government services. Additional 
functionality was later added to the CCC, 
including facilitating utility bill payments 
and applications, providing information 
on government programs and schemes, 
accessing other specialty services, and 
accepting university fee payments. Further, 
the CCC serves as an official complaint 
department for citizens. The call centre can 
be reached between 9AM and 7PM every 
day (excluding public holidays) and can be 
accessed toll-free.

Thiruvananthapuram pilot encouraged the 
government of Kerala State to roll out more 
call centres, which can now be found in each 
of the state’s 14 districts. The state is currently 
exploring the potential for expanding the CCC 
into a more expansive contact centre — which 
will include an email and web portal, social 
media integration, online chat interfaces, 
SMS/MMS integration, and more. 

KEY LEARNINGS: The call centres have 

greatly expanded citizen engagement and 
their access to government in Kerala. Their 
success demonstrates that a) call centres 
hold immense potential as an engagement 
platform, and b) implementing a call centre 
requires several key design principles. By 
gradually rolling out a call centre and growing 
it slowly (in both size and available services) 
based on learnings from earlier phases, Kerala 
created a thriving engagement platform 
where citizens can access municipal services 
and input free-of-charge. They did this by 
also ensuring the following components in the 
system: free access, extensive infrastructure 
support, gradual programmatic expansion, 
usability for multiple purposes, alignment 
to topics and uses that are important to 
citizens, and integration across government 
departments so that callers could be 
effectively directed from one department to 
the next. 

INSPIRATION  
Improving Performance in 
Solid Waste Management 
in Pune, India

CHALLENGE: The Pune Municipal Corporation 

(PMC) grapples with inefficient waste 
management; this in combination with an 
upsurge in demand, yet diminished consumer 
confidence, has resulted in poor service 
delivery. A baseline evaluation of the city’s 
waste management system identified gaps 
related to inadequate processing capacity, 
limited collection services at the primary 
household level, poor coordination and 
outdated equipment for collection at the 
secondary level, pervasive citizen apathy 
directed toward proper waste collection, 
insufficient monitoring and governance of the 
services and staff, and a lack of clear policy, 
land provisions, or infrastructure.

INTERVENTION: To address these gaps, the 

PMC set out to improve accountability 
and better manage waste collection via 
an integrated waste management system 
focused on leveraging citizen engagement, 
minimising waste generation, and cutting the 
rates of uncollected and unprocessed waste. 
The municipality has undertaken a series of 
regulatory and awareness-raising actions, 
including:

•  Incentivising compliance by waste collectors 

and service providers

•  Levying a component of property tax for solid 

waste management

•  Restructuring the Department of Sanitation 

and building capacity of existing staff

•  Instituting and deploying an IT-based system 

for operations monitoring, to improve 
evaluation and data aggregation

•  Forming a Monitoring Committee comprised 

of the Mayor, Members of Parliament, head 
of the Department of Sanitation, community 
members, and diverse political leadership

OUTCOMES: The PMC established a project 

management unit for a two-year period, 
responsible for preparing policy and tender 
documents, providing transaction advisory 
services, accessing private CSR funds to 
support the implementation of sanitation 
department initiatives, and fundraising for and 
managing the project budget. 

KEY LEARNINGS: Addressing the sanitation 
challenge in Pune required deployment of 
a cross-sectoral, multi-prong approach. 
Additional learnings have included the 
following:

•  Early consideration of revenue generation and 

sustainability planning

•  Consideration of current waste management 

needs as well as those of the future, given the 
reality of rapid urbanisation

•  A comprehensive waste management plan 

that addressed the issue of inadequate cost 
recovery for rendered services

•  Investment in an extensive community 

sensitisation campaign on the new policy 
and consideration of residents as part of the 
solution

•  Integration of informal waste collectors 

allowed for a more responsive plan

•  Recognition that an over-dependence on 
landfills could result in environmental and 
social challenges

•  Launching an intensive campaign on source 

•  Use of available technology solutions to track 

segregation 

and measure performance.

•  Promoting processing of wet waste at the 

household and city level

INITIATIVEPILLAR 3

A City that embraces informality 
in its urban systems to harness its 
contribution to resilience building�

The informal economy is heterogeneous and complex, offering both opportunities 
and lessons on resilience and livelihoods� Over the years, cities throughout 
Africa have viewed informality either as a phenomenon to be ignored or dealt 
with through attempts at removal and demolition� In Accra the informal sector 
has reached such a significant scale that 
it cannot be ignored� There is growing 
acknowledgement of informality as a mainstay 
in Africa’s urbanisation narrative� Much of 
the region’s economic growth is taking place 
in the informal sector� Over 80% of Accra’s 
population participates in the informal 
economy, making this a critical contributor 
to the nation’s GDP�30 Undoubtedly, 
rising urbanisation will lead to increasing 
informality, both in the economy and in the 
built environment� If properly understood 
and worked with, informal systems can 
increase inclusion as well as strengthen the 
performance of the formal sector� 

An informed and engaged citizenry 
is a prerequisite for developing 
structures and systems that 
enhance resilience building. Accra 
has a large informal sector which is 
dominated by women. Having such 
a large and influential segment of 
the society knowing, understanding, 
and appreciating the need for 
systems that support resilience 
building is an asset and can help to 
ensure a thriving city. 

- Mr� Desmond Appiah,  
Office of the Mayor

Past attempts at removal and demolition have not worked� Demolished informal 
settlements have triggered violent protests and former and new residents with 
limited options return and rebuild� Removal of itinerant vendors in decongestion 
exercises also tends to be short lived� Accra must approach informality with a 
hybrid of innovative approaches, both new and existing, that can improve the 
quality of life and reduce harm for residents that work or live in this sector� The 
human rights of residents of informal settlements need to be recognised through 
access to basic services, including safe drinking water, sanitation, and shelter� 
Workers in the informal economy need access to appropriate safety nets� The 
recognition of the symbiotic relationship between the informal and formal sectors 
will aid in developing a resilient city� 

Informality knows no geographic boundaries� Informal settlements and an 
informal economy will continue to be a reality and an intrinsic component of 
Accra’s urbanisation narrative, along with that of other emerging economies� The 
Decentralisation Act shifts the geographic boundaries of areas to be prioritised for 
slum upgrading and urban renewal beyond the AMA’s previous borders� While this 
represents a slight deviation from the AMA’s previous vision, the Assembly remains 
poised to provide leadership in cross- jurisdictional coalition building and capacity 
building towards optimising informality’s contribution to resilience� Finally, a new 
approach to informality must consider integration between the formal and informal 
sectors to ensure a co-existence, which ultimately fosters improved economic, 
social, and environmental benefits for all of Accra’s residents�

92

INITIATIVEGOAL 

3.1

Improve the quality of life for citizens 
working in the informal sector and/or 
living in informal settlements.

In cities of the Global South, the informal economy accounts for up 
to 40% of GDP�31  Informal settlements are home to as much as 25% 
of the urban population, and informal transport provides mobility 
for upwards of 60% of the populace� The informal economy has 
become especially prominent in the lives of Africans in recent years, 
stemming from the opportunities it offers to the most vulnerable 
urban populations, such as the poor, women, and youth� In total, the 
informal sector contributes about 55% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP 
and comprises 80% of the labour force� 

With 80% of Accra’s urban population employed in the informal 
sector, and where 90% of non-agricultural employment is informal, 
Accra epitomises the informal city�32 Accra’s informal sector plays 
an important role in the city’s economic development by creating 
employment opportunities and housing for a significant proportion 
of the populace� From public transport to domestic labour, the vast 
majority of goods and services in the city are procured informally� 
In spite of its importance, workers in the informal economy and 
residents of informal settlements are faced with many challenges, 
and their day-to-day realities experience an increase in vulnerability 
when the city is struck by unforeseen shocks� Improving the quality 
of life for these residents will contribute to strengthening the 
economy and the overall resilience of the city� Actors in the informal 
sector are the most vulnerable of the populace�

Furthermore, as Accra’s economy rapidly evolves, it is critical to 
understand the lives of its informal participants, and design services 
that align with the social networks and informal services on which 
people currently rely� Through this, we can help lift thousands of 
previously neglected citizens into the stability they need to improve 
their economic situations and help them seize the opportunities they 
need to thrive�

INITIATIVEINSPIRATION  
GHAFUP Collaboration on Slum Upgrading in Ashaiman, Ghana36 

CHALLENGE: Ashaiman municipality in Greater 
Accra lies adjacent to Tema, Ghana’s largest 
seaport. The Amuj Djor community located 
within Ashaiman has long housed low-skilled 
labourers primarily employed in the industries 
located in Tema. Many residents in the Amui 
Djor live in poor slum conditions lacking basic 
services. 

INTERVENTION: For years, the Ghana 

Federation of the Urban Poor (GHAFUP), 
a network of community savings groups in 
informal settlements and poor communities, 
has been mobilising their membership base 
in Amui Djor, helping members to build 
savings, providing low-cost loans, and 
hosting discussion and support groups. A 
recurring issue of concern was nevertheless 
the inability of members to access bank loans 
to build or improve their living conditions. In 
2009, Ghana Federation for the Urban Poor, 
the Government of Ghana, UN-Habitat, and 
People’s Dialogue, a local NGO and affiliate of 
Slum Dwellers International, completed an on-
site, participatory pilot for slum upgrading in 
Amui Djor. With resources from UN-Habitat’s 
Slum Upgrading Facility, a local financing 
facility was created to bring stakeholders 
together, help structure the upgrading 
project, and provide technical advice and 
mobilise financing. 

OUTCOMES: Funds from the facility, along 
with savings from members of the Ghana 
Federation for the Urban Poor, financed the 
construction of the Amui Dzor project — a 
three-story structure with 15 commercial 

units, 31 one- and two-bedroom apartments, 
and a 12-seater public toilet managed by 
a cooperative of residents. The land on 
which the project stands formerly housed 10 
families; after the completion of the project, 
about 31 households pay monthly instalments 
for their ownership share. 

KEY LEARNINGS: One of the biggest, yet 

underestimated challenges in this upgrading 
project were of a legal and regulatory nature. 
Details around navigating land tenure, 
building permits, and utility connections were 
not sufficiently considered during the design 
stage. As such, a Cities Alliance evaluation of 
the project found that the granting of land to 
the Amui Djor Cooperative Housing Society 
was a time-consuming process involving both 
the formal municipality and the traditional 
council. 

Also important to note is that this upgrading 
project, which resulted in the development 
of the three Amui Djor buildings, required 
direct and indirect subsidies of almost US 
$3000 per family. Such subsidies are typically 
not sustainable. As recommended by the 
Cities Alliance project evaluation, other 
municipalities should consider upgrading 
efforts focused on financing of home 
improvements, neighbourhood infrastructure, 
and/or modest core houses that can be 
expanded and improved upon over time. 

Finally, critical to the success of this upgrading 

case study was a strong and organised 
intermediary, capable of mobilising the 
community. In this case, People’s Dialogue 
played this indispensable role.37

INITIATIVEPlanning for Urban Growth

Cities continue to grow at a rapid rate, 
frequently seeing their population expand by 
2% or more annually — the benchmark of rapid 
urban growth� To begin to understand what this 
means for urban resilience, 100 Resilient Cities 
collaborated with New York University’s Marron 
Institute to develop urban growth projections 
for twenty of the network’s most rapidly 
expanding cities located in the Global South�

To be truly impactful, a city’s Resilience 
Strategy must not only consider existing 
urban areas but also account for projected 
urban growth – and use it as an opportunity 
to accelerate resilience-building� Failure to 
plan and organise the expansion areas of 
cities is the root cause of a number of serious 
resilience challenges including: housing 
affordability, traffic congestion, poor access 
to labor markets and public space, natural 
hazard risk to communities, loss of natural 
environment and ecosystems, and lack of 
basic services such as water, sanitation, and 
electricity� It also costs more� The expense of 
bringing critical infrastructure into existing 
communities is 3 to 9 times higher than the 
cost of installing the basic trunk infrastructure 
in planned communities, incrementally, in 
advance of development�

Historically, Accra grew from a population 
of 1,307,784 in 1991 to 4,429,649 in 2014, at 
an annual rate of 5�3%� The area inhabited by 
that population, otherwise known as the urban 
extent, increased at an annual rate of 8�1%, 
from 13,324ha in 1991 to 87,212 ha in 2014� 
That means Accra’s density declined from 
98 people per hectare in 1991 to 51 people 
per hectare in 2014� More than half of the 
growth in Accra occurred as a result of the 
conversion to urban use of unbuilt land� Only 
66% of the residential areas built between 
1991 and 2014 were planned before they were 
developed� This means the opportunity for 
orderly provision of public transportation 
and infrastructure was missed in 34% of the 
residential areas� 

Projections by the Marron Institute suggest 
that Accra will continue to grow rapidly in 
population and area� By 2050, the area’s 
population is projected to increase to 
10,505,000 people and population density 
could decline from 48 people per hectare to  
29 people per hectare in that same time period�

The AMA will explore the creation of a unit that will be 

responsible for the management of the informal economy. 

This will require the formation of a subcommittee, which, 

in  engaging  the  various  stakeholders  of  the  informal 

economy,  will  draw  up  recommendations  for  the  roles 

and responsibilities of this unit. Possible responsibilities 

include  demarcating  official  trading  areas, 

issuing 

permits,  providing  capacity  building  and  training  for 

leaders from informal associations in the development of 

occupational skills, leading sensitisation and enforcement 

of regulations, and provision of basic financial support on

INITIATIVE IN BRIEF

The  City  plans  to  increase  access  to  safety  nets  to  help 

informal  workers  respond  better  to  physical  risks, 

economic crisis, and other shocks. The Assembly will do 

this by: 

•  facilitating the registration of informal sector workers 

to  the  national  pension  scheme  through  collaboration 

with the National Trust Holdings Company (NTHC);

•  engaging  in  periodic  sensitisation  and  education  pro-

grams  to  spread  awareness  and  understanding  of  the 

integrates street traders into how the city 
plans. Warwick Junction is characterised 
by attractive and appropriately designed 
trader infrastructure, as well as services like 
childcare facilities and affordable overnight 
accommodation. Deep consultation with 
stakeholders has produced an unprecedented 
level of self-regulation that keeps the area 
clean and crime-free. In Warwick Junction and 
elsewhere, the city has launched innovative 
programs such as health training for food 
traders, low-fee rates for use of urban space, 
new market construction as well as upgrading 
existing market facilities, providing shelters 
for street traders, and helping informal 
businesses develop both hard and soft 
business skills.  

KEY LEARNINGS: The city’s response to informal 

traders and more broadly the informal 
economy elevates a number of relevant 
insights. First, it is important for municipal 
governments to start small and pilot new 
policy shifts. Second, municipal governments 
must remove by-laws that erroneously 
hinder positive contributions of the informal 
economy. Finally, consultation with informal 
traders was a hallmark of Durban’s success.

CHALLENGE: By 1994, following the end 

of Apartheid and the election of the first 
South African democratic government, the 
municipal government of eThekwini (Durban) 
recognised the need to integrate the informal 
economy into city planning efforts. The city 
began removing restrictive trade policies, 
making it easier for informal traders to 
move freely about the city and access new 
markets and trading areas. For example, 
over 4,000 traders moved into what is now 
South Africa’s largest transportation and 
trading hub, Warwick Junction. However, 
the city neither provided nor facilitated the 
management of trading activities or facilities. 
Lack of management at Warwick Junction 
and other burgeoning trading sites in the city 
eventually became a challenge to broader city 
management.

INTERVENTION: In 1999, the eThekwini 

Municipality formed a subcommittee to 
draw up recommendations for new policies 
to govern the informal economy. One such 
recommendation was the establishment 
of the Department of Informal Trade and 
Small Business Opportunities (DITSBO), 
with the mandate to: declare management 
zones; demarcate official trading areas; 
issue permits; organise traders into area 
committees, which then feed into citywide 
forums; and enforce regulations and resolve 
disputes between informal sector parties. 
After nearly a year of substantial stakeholder 
consultation, the subcommittee additionally

3.2

Facilitate robust integration between 
the formal and informal sectors for 
improved economic, social, and 
environmental benefits

An important, complementary, and synergistic relationship exists 
between the formal and informal sectors in Accra� If effectively 
nurtured, this can promote resilient growth and reduce urban 
poverty� In recognition that the informal economy is here to stay, 
and that the informal and formal economies are intrinsically linked, 
the City seeks to advance strategies which promote more equitable 
linkages between the two systems and which balance the relative 
costs and benefits of work that is done formally and informally� The 
nature of Accra’s informal economy presents a number of specific 
opportunities for better integration into the formal economy� For 
instance, the informal waste collection system works hand-in-hand 
with the formal waste collection system in the cleaning of the city� 
The initiatives in this goal will result in better integration of actors 
across these sectors — to strengthen livelihood opportunities and the 
city as a whole�

INITIATIVECommitment to Implementation

After several years of participatory meetings, stakeholder outreach, 
and engagements, Accra’s Resilience Strategy is poised for 
implementation� Its framework of 3 pillars, 8 goals, and 27 initiatives 
address a range of challenges affecting not only Accra but also 
many other African cities undergoing rapid urbanisation: flooding, 
the exponential growth of informal settlements, inadequate waste 
management, traffic, congestion, infrastructure collapse, fire 
outbreaks, and poor community engagement, among others� 

Led by the Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) and the city’s Resilience 
Team within the AMA, this strategy’s development has benefited 
significantly from insights shared by donor and development 
partners, research institutions, consultants, AMA staff, community 
leaders, and most importantly, the residents of Accra� It provides 
a framework for protecting the city against potential known and 
unknown shocks and stresses that we may encounter now and in 
the future�

The City of Accra is committed to the implementation of this 
strategy� The CRO and the Resilience Team together with other 
departmental staff within the Assembly, Central Government 
Ministries, other MMDAs, and external partners will work to 
overcome barriers to implementation, connect people and 
resources, track strategy progress, and mitigate risks as necessary� 
A framework for monitoring and evaluation to track and report on 
implementation progress will be developed� Implementation will 
require significant coordination and collaboration, similar in many 
regards to the efforts required to develop this ambitious vision for 
resilience� 

While the AMA remains the primary custodian of the Resilience 
Strategy, we appreciate that successful implementation 
necessitates shared responsibility and contributions of actors 
and effort within the municipal government and beyond� These 
include government agencies, businesses, civil society, non-profit 
organisations, and residents� 

Leadership on strategy initiatives will be assigned to key AMA 
staff and close partner institutions who will serve as project 
managers� However, these projects will require cross-jurisdictional 
collaboration, resource allocation, and management for success�  
The Resilience Office will lead efforts on regional capacity building 
for newly-formed districts, existing MMDAs, and other partners� Now 
more than ever, this level of collaboration is critical for ensuring our 
city’s future� The AMA is committed to approaching implementation 
and partnership in a more integrated way� We call upon all to 
support these efforts in whatever capacity possible� 

The Accra Metropolitan Assembly is committed to playing a key 
role to facilitate and initiate projects and the necessary strategic 
framework� The Resilience Office is available for consultations, 
advice, and support, and is ready to learn from the experiences of 
other cities and resilience building organisations around the globe�
