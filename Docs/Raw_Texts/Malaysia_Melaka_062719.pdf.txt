Letter from the Mayor of Melaka Historic 
City Council

Letter From Melaka’s First Chief 
Resilience O(cid:9)  cer

YBhg. Tuan Haji 
Mansor bin Sudin

Around the globe, cities strive to provide 
the best for their citizens. Desire of 
turning ideas into opportunity and reality 
is what drives the cities. Melaka City 
is fortunate to be freed from natural 
disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic 
eruptions and typhoons. Geographically, 
Melaka City is situated outside the Paci c 
Ring of  re and is comparatively free 
from pillage and destruction caused 
by natural disasters. However, climate 
change is impacting our city, along with 
other shocks and stresses, that need our 
attention.

We are now experiencing an increase in 
the number of  oods and  ash  oods 
caused by the rise in sea levels which 
had cost us millions to recover. Rising 
temperatures on the other hand has 
contributed to biological threats such 
as dengue spread by mosquitoes, and 
extreme variations in rainfall has caused 
dams to become drier. These impacts 
hold consequences for our economy, our 
unique heritage, and our quality of life.

This is what Resilient Melaka is about. It 
is a strategy that includes actions to help 
us fortify our infrastructure, protect our 
economy and heritage values in making 
our city safer for generations to come. 
It’s also about strengthening the bonds 
of community in our neighborhoods 
and reinforcing universal values such as 
inclusion and respect - because we can 
only overcome our greatest threats if we 
work together. 

Melaka City already had plans in hand 
to tackle some of these challenges, 
developed by my of ce and the State 
government. Resilient Melaka builds on 
those ideas and brings them together 
into one holistic plan that will guide 
us toward a more resilient future. The 
decisions we make today will shape the 
city that our children and grandchildren 
will live in tomorrow—and we have a 
responsibility to protect their future. This 
strategy will help give us the insight and 
tools we need to build a more resilient 
Melaka, and I look forward to working 
with all stakeholders to accomplish that 
critical goal.

Thank you.

Mohd Ridhwan 
Mohd Ali

First and foremost, I would like to 
humbly thank the Almighty God, whose 
sustaining grace has been sufficient 
for our Resilience Unit to complete this 
endeavour.

Today, we are proud to share 
the Resilient Melaka strategy, a 
comprehensive plan developed together 
with our partners – for the community 
of Melaka. This strategy, and the actions 
within it, aim to address the root causes 
of the city’s shocks and stresses and 
facilitate a thriving and diverse future, 
regardless of future challenges that the 
city may face. 

The development of this strategy 
represents the commitment of Melaka’s 
City Administration to provide the best 
for its citizens. It also reflects the synergy 
that exists, across public, private, 
academic and civic institutions across 
our city. 

I am thankful for the privilege of 
working and collaborating with many 
parties, including our local resilience 
champions from various part of the city, 
in developing this strategy. Resilient 
Melaka’s strategy reflects the issues and 

initiatives that many had raised, and it 
will guide us, as together we build a more 
resilient city of Melaka.  Thank you to all 
who have contributed for your support 
and commitment to creating a brighter 
future for Melaka. 

The release of Melaka’s first Resilience 
Strategy is only the start of our work. 
We are committed to continuing to 
collaborate across MBMB and partners 
agencies. We will work together to 
develop new partnerships, design new 
initiatives and implement the priority 
resilience projects within this strategy.

I would therefore like to thank our Mayor 
for entrusting the Resilience Unit to 
pioneer this effort and institutionalise 
our unit within Melaka’s City Council. We 
will continue resilience building efforts 
beyond the initial support provided by 
100 Resilient Cities. 

Let’s join our forces and together we will 
strive for the betterment of our beloved 
city.

Letter from 100 Resilient Cities President

Michael Berkowitz

On behalf of 100 Resilient Cities 
- Pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation, I want to congratulate 
the City of Melaka and Mayor Tuan Hj. 
Mansor bin Sudin on the successful 
release of the city’s  rst Resilience 
Strategy. This document highlights the 
city’s commitment to building urban 
resilience and is the culmination of 
two years of partnership, research, 
collaboration, and innovation in one of 
Malaysia’s most important and historic 
cities. This work would not have come 
to life without the leadership of Chief 
Resilience Of cer Mohd Ridhwan bin 
Mohd Ali  and the continuous support 
of Melaka’s highest levels of leadership 
including Datuk Wira Zainal Bin Hussin 
and Datuk Hj. Azmi bin Hj. Hussain.

As an historic city, Melaka is no stranger 
to change. From its humble beginnings 
as a trading port to an internationally 
renowned UNESCO World Heritage 
Site, Melaka has reinvented itself and 
adapted to its times and circumstances 
while strengthening its communities 
to preserve that which makes it 
unique.  In the next coming years, 
Melaka’s transformation will continue 
– its population is expected to grow 
signi cantly due to migration, resulting in 
a more vibrant and diverse city. Shocks 
and stresses such as water shortages, 

 ooding, and traf c congestion will 
continue to challenge the city; making 
trust and collaboration between its 
communities more crucial. Ensuring 
Melaka’s unique patchwork of people 
all have a voice will safeguard a resilient 
future for years to come. 

Melaka’s Resilience Strategy places its 
people and history at the center with 
a focus on three pillars: Thriving and 
Engaged Communities; A livable, vibrant 
and ef ciently connected cityscape; 
Collective Leadership and Smart 
Governance.  With people and history at 
its core, partnership and collaboration 
will be essential to the implementation 
of this urban resilience strategy.  I 
encourage everyone across the city – 
from communities to the private sector 
to every government department – to 
take responsibility for bringing this vision 
to life.  

Congratulations once again.  We look 
forward to watching Melaka’s leadership 
in urban resilience continue to unfold on 
both a national and international scale.

Sincerely,

MICHAEL BERKOWITZ

PRESIDENT, 100 RESILIENT CITIES -

PIONEERED BY THE ROCKEFELLER 
FOUNDATION

Chapter 1 - Introduction

Urban Resilience
is the capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, 
businesses and systems within 
a city to survive, adapt and grow 
no matter what kinds of chronic 
stresses and acute shocks 
they experience. 

Executive Summary

In 2016, Melaka was selected to be part of the 100 
Resilient Cities Network - an initiative pioneered by the 
Rockefeller Foundation. 

The 100 Resilient Cities program supports the 
introduction and integration of a vision of resilience 
that includes not only sudden shocks ( res,  oods, 
epidemics, etc.) but also chronic events or stresses, that 
weaken the fabric of a city every day or cyclically (high 
unemployment, inef cient transport systems, poor air 
or water quality etc.). By mitigating the sudden and 
chronic events, a city may improve its ability to respond 
effectively and provide better basic services to the 
population.

Melaka’s  rst resilience strategy guides the historic city 
in strengthening its ability to survive, adapt and thrive 
amidst the urban challenges it faces both today, and in 
the future. 

The Resilient Melaka strategy sets a vision for a 

“a vibrant city, where smart governance, collective 
leadership, sustainable mobility and protective 
infrastructure supports a thriving, healthy community 
that is proud of Melaka’s outstanding universal values as 
a world heritage city.”

The strategy is organized into three pillars which re ect 
the city’s vision and needs for Melaka’s future: 

Pillar 1: Thriving and Engaged Communities 
emphasizes the fundamental role of our community in 
building resilience. This pillar brings together actions 
to equip Melaka’s residents, households and business 
owners with the knowledge and skills to address our 
city’s water, waste and health challenges effectively. 
It also encourages all citizens to celebrate and 
preserve Melaka’s unique heritage, and take part in the 
conversation about our city’s future. 

Pillar 2: A Livable, Vibrant and E(cid:3)  ciently Connected 
City brings together actions to improve to our mobility 
network, public transport services, urban spaces 
and infrastructure so that they can create healthier 
environments for residents and visitors. These actions 
seek to improve resident’s quality of life, but also aim 
to enhance the attractiveness of Melaka to visitors and 
investors.

Pillar 3: Collective Leadership and Smart Governance 
seeks to broaden Melaka’s capacity to act upon key 
issues for Melaka’s future by building a network of 
private and  public stakeholders; developing a data-
driven and evidence based approach to key decisions; 
and promoting integrated long-term planning across 
different departments and agencies.

Collective Governance 
and Smart Leadership

Melaka’s Resilience Strategy 
aims to improve the quality of 
life, economic opportunities, 

and governing processes 

impacting Melaka’s citizens.  

This document is a key 

milestone in setting out the 

Resilient Melaka agenda, 

presenting the city’s vision and 
the pillars, goals and actions 
that will help us achieve it.

100 Resilient Cities de nes urban resilience as:

“the capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to 
survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of 
chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.” 

Urban resilience aims to  nd effective and pragmatic 
solutions that prepare cities for expected shocks 
or stresses, as well as unforeseen challenges. This 
approach calls for a fundamental change in the way in 
which urban ecosystems are understood as  exible and 
adaptable to change.

All cities in the 21st century face complex and 
interdependent crises. This includes a global economic 
system under great strain, social and territorial tension, 
ongoing terror threats,  decreasing environmental 
resources, increasing migration  ows, and the unknown 
consequences of a changing global climate.

As cities are at the forefront of these disruptions, they 
must adapt and be flexible to change.

Characteristics of resilient systems

Resilient systems possess seven qualities that enable 
them to withstand, respond to and adapt more 
readily to shocks and stress by taking appropriate or 
prompt action.  

REFLECTIVE 
using past experience to 
inform future decisions

RESOURCEFUL
recognizing alternative 
ways to use resources

ROBUST
well–conceived, 
constructed, and 
managed systems

REDUNDANT
spare capacity 
purposively created 
to accommodate 
disruption

FLEXIBLE
willingness and ability 
to adopt alternative 
strategies in response to 
changing circumstances

INCLUSIVE
wide-ranging 
consultation and sharing 
in decision-making 
processes

INTEGRATED
bring together a range 
of distinct systems and 
institutions

The City Resilience Framework 
encompasses all aspects of urban 
development, from natural and built 
assets to resident’s wellbeing, and 
socio-economic issues, underpinned by 
effective leadership and governance. 
The CRF provides a frame of reference 
through which the complexity of a city 
can be analyzed. This was used to design 
Melaka’s Resilience Strategy.

100RC 
Member City

In 2016, Melaka was selected to join the 100 Resilient 
Cities (100RC) network, pioneered by the Rockefeller 
Foundation. Melaka now receives funding and support 
from 100RC to catalyze resilience at the city scale.

100 Resilient Cities is dedicated to helping cities around 
the world become more resilient to the physical, social, 
and economic challenges that are a growing part of 
the 21st century. 100RC supports the adoption and 
incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not 
just the shocks but also the stresses that weaken the 
fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis.

By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city 
becomes more able to respond to adverse events, and 
is overall better able to deliver basic functions in both 
good times and bad, to all populations. 

MELAKA

Cities in the 100RC network are provided with the 
resources necessary to develop a road map to resilience 
along four main pathways:

1.  Financial and logistical guidance for establishing an 
innovative new position in city government, a Chief 
Resilience Of cer, who will lead the city’s resilience 
efforts,

2.  Expert support for development of a robust 

resilience strategy,

3.  Access to solutions, service providers, and partners 

from the private, public and NGO sectors who can 
help them develop and implement their resilience 
strategies, as well as

4.  Membership of a global network of member cities 

who can learn from and help each other.

Through these actions, 100RC aims not only to help 
individual cities become more resilient, but will facilitate 
the building of a global practice of resilience among 
governments, NGOs, the private sector, and individual 
citizens.

Resilient Melaka

Melaka’s ﬁ rst resilience strategy guides 
the historic city in strengthening its ability 
to survive, adapt and thrive amidst the 
urban challenges it faces both today, 
and in the future. 
The challenges posed by Melaka’s urban 
development, population growth and 
mass tourism cannot be addressed 
independently. The causes of these 
challenges, and the opportunities 
to create solutions, are complex 
and intertwined.

Learning from our past

In order to look ahead and develop a strategy for a more 
resilient future, Melaka must  rst understand its past, 
and learn from how the city managed and responded to 
previous shocks and stresses it has encountered.

“MBMB (Formally known as 
MPMT (Majlis Perbandaran 
Melaka Tengah)) becomes the 
centre of the city’s political and 
economic administration. The 
city can therefore take more 
direct ownership of local issues.

Melaka’s GDP declined, making it one of the 

poorest states in Malaysia. 

National Government decided to invest in 

tourism for development, with strong initiatives 
to expand the heritage tourism sector in Melaka.

1980s

Malaysia’s commodity 
exports declined

1977

Melaka City 
Administration 
was established

1980s

Growing urbanisation 
and car ownership

Congestion became a critical 
issue facing the city, and so 
the North-South express-
way was constructed to 
mitigate traf c pressures.

~1400

Parameswara 
established the 
port of Melaka

Establishing the port of Melaka marked the 
initiation of the city becoming a global trading 
hub, and the city sought to develop trade 
relations with China.

Access roads were damaged 
and nearby residents needed 
to be temporarily re-housed.

Retaining walls were built to 

reinforce the hillside.

Melaka’s UNESCO 
World Heritage 
Site is celebrated as an 
outstanding example of 
unique architecture, culture 
and townscape, re ecting a 
mixture of in uences, without 
parallel in East and 
Southeast Asia.

The vegetation 
along Melaka’s shoreline 
is an important resource. 
It prevents erosion along  
coastal areas, provides 
habitat for animal and  sh 
species, and also helps to 
reduce the impact of 
coastal  oods.

MELAKA CITY ASSETS

The Melaka 
River, running 
through the center 
of the City, is 
categorized as mildly 
polluted despite the 
beauti cation works 
of the recent years. 
Other water courses 
in the City have 
generally poor water 
quality, and this is 
yet to be addressed.

Melaka’s Future

From its historical beginning as a key 
South-East Asian trading settlement, 
Melaka has since grown into a vibrant, 
multicultural and global entrepôt. The city 
is now reaching a pivotal point in 
its development.

Melaka is expanding in area much more rapidly than it 
is expanding in population. Population density declined 
signi cantly between 1989 and 2016. This urban growth 
is being driven by both the land reclamation along the 
coast and sprawling developments into the city suburbs.   

Melaka is a car-dominated city, without a coordinated 
public transit system and serious tra(cid:141)c congestion 
issues.  This is a cause of concern for the economic, 
social and environmental health of the historic city. 
How can Melaka adapt and upgrade its transport 
infrastructure to improve air quality and quality of life 
for both residents and visitors?

The population of Melaka is 
projected to increase by 63% in 
the next 35 years, to 883,000 
people. Much of this population 
growth will be driven by 
immigration and mega-projects. 

Source: NYU Melaka Urban Growth Analysis, 2016

Mass tourism is creating an economic boost for the 
city, but how can Melaka’s unique authentic cultural 
heritage be preserved? Can the heritage area be 
protected from potential ﬂood or ﬁre risks?

Are the new developments emerging along the coast 
su(cid:11)ciently regulated to ensure the environmental and 
cultural assets of the city are protected?

The adverse effects of climate change and the growing 
demand on its infrastructure are increasingly placing 
pressure on the city. Can the city’s infrastructure 
and public services secure the upgrades and funding 
needed to provide the rapidly increasing population 
with a health quality of life?  

The challenges posed by Melaka’s urban development, 
population growth and mass tourism cannot be 
addressed independently. The causes of these 
challenges and the opportunities to create solutions, are 
complex and intertwined.

Melaka’s resilience strategy brings 
an opportunity to mitigate the 
potentially negative consequences 
of urban growth and enables 
Melaka to adapt and become a 
world renowned UNESCO World 
Heritage and Green Technology 
City, attractive to both business 
and international visitors, 
achieving fully its aspirations.

Melaka’s Resilience Building E(cid:14) orts

The Resilience Unit, MBMB

Melaka Resilience Unit has now been established within 
MBMB’s Planning Department. This unit is tasked 
with implementing Melaka’s resilience strategy, in 
close collaboration with the Heads of Department of 
MBMB, the Resilience Steering Committee and other 
key partners in Melaka. The Unit has secured budgets 
required for implementing the Resilient Melaka strategy, 
and will be working with other key stakeholders to plan 
and implement the projects listed in this strategy.

The Of ce will be responsible for: 

•  Convening government agencies, private 

organisations and community groups with the aim of 
establishing funding to implement actions that make 
Melaka stronger and more resilient;

•  Monitoring and updating the Resilience Strategy;
•  Promoting a culture of resilience; This may 

involve coaching different municipal departments 
in developing annual priorities and budgets in an 
integrated, cross-departmental way;

•  Supporting and creating networks of organizations 
and stakeholders who work in the  eld of resilience 
to promote good practices.

Melaka’s Resilience Unit has a 
key role to play in convening 
and coordinating action across 
multiple sectors.

Several major planning efforts are already building 
resilience in the city, creating a safer, healthier, and 
more equitable Melaka. 

The concept of resilience appears across many of these 
documents, however often they focuses upon either 
urban development, economic development or resource 
ef ciency rather than the holistic, multi-sector approach 
promoted by the concept of resilience.

Resilient Melaka establishes an overarching approach 
to resilience, which works with, and is aligned to other 
international, national and city policies. It leverages 
existing efforts, highlights complementary actions 
and identi es new approaches to protecting Melaka’s 
citizens and safeguarding its environment.

Partnership and Collaborations

Resilient Melaka is a true collaboration.

It is the result of many existing and emerging partnerships, 
between Melaka Historic City, the community, Melaka 
State, research institutions and the broader 100RC 
network.

To address the complex and interrelated resilience 
challenges Melaka will face in the future, we need to 
discard the silos in which we traditionally work in order to: 

•  Obtain multiple perspectives and approaches,

•  Leverage the resources and expertise of multiple 

stakeholders

This strategy was therefore developed in collaboration 
with over 320 city stakeholders from government, private 
sector, academia and the general public.

Resilience Champions 
We’ve have the support of 
many fantastic champions 
across departments in MBMB. 
Resilience Champions have 
support the Resilience Unit in

Resilience Challenges

KEY SHOCKS

KEY STRESSES

The urban area of Melaka 
is undergoing radical 
transformations that will 
a(cid:127) ect its vulnerability to 
shocks and stresses in the 
decades to come. 

The Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment identi ed 
a set interconnected 
resilience challenges. 
These form the 
foundations for 
this strategy.

The projects within 
Melaka’s Resilience 
Strategy are designed 
to address the city’s 
shocks and stresses in 
a comprehensive and 
integrated manner.

In resilience terms, a shock 
is a sudden or acute event 
that threatens Melaka’s 
immediate wellbeing. A 
shock could be a  ood, 
infrastructure failure, an 
extreme weather event, 
or civil unrest.  100RC 
encourages cities to 
adopt and incorporate 
a view of resilience that 
includes not just the 
shocks, but also the 
stresses that weaken the 
fabric of a city on a day 
to day, or cyclical basis. 

Flood Risk
Aging and poorly maintained drainage systems, and design  aws in 
irrigation systems are creating signi cant  ood risk in several locations 
across Melaka.  Shallow drainage pipes cannot hold enough capacity 
during heavy rain events, often resulting in surface  ooding. This can 
be exacerbated by litter clogging the drainage system, as drains are not 
always covered. The obsolescence of the drainage system is particularly 
evident in the World Heritage Site. 

Water Shortages
Water usage by consumers in Melaka is high, up to 230 liters daily per 
individual compared with national average of 180 liters daily. This results 
in Melaka needing about 500 million liters of water daily and the current 
capacity of utility networks and reservoirs cannot meet the future 
demand.  Melaka relies on importing water from areas outside of MBMB’s 
jurisdiction. The municipality is therefore limited in being able to secure 
its water supply. Moreover, population growth is likely to exacerbate 
water supply shortage. There is a need to engage the greatest users of 
water (industry and hotel) in more sustainable and resilient management 
of water to avoid future shortages. 

Disease Outbreaks
Cases of food poisoning, Hand Food and Mouth, Tuberculosis and 
dengue cases have reached signi cant levels in recent years due to poor 
maintenance of drainage systems, poor hygiene and environmental 
sanitation. Several factors are contributing to poor water quality in 
certain areas and the spread of diseases - these include illegal dumping 
or discharge from waste into the drainage channels or river; stagnant 
water; clogged drains; and litter not being cleaned regularly.

A disease outbreak could pose a signi cant risk to human life in the city. 
This would greatly affect Melaka’s reputation as a safe tourist destination, 
resulting in a loss of income for many small businesses.

Fire Risk
The very old utilities networks within the WHS are fragile and nearing 
maximum capacity, which can cause failures and  re risk. Many of the 
buildings in the WHS are back-to-back and very close to each other. This 
creates issues for waste and water management, but also poses a risk for 
emergency service access and evacuation.

Risk of Losing World Heritage Status 
The changing social fabric in the WHS places Melaka at risk of losing the 
city’s heritage status.  The increasing property costs are pricing out local 
business owners, and displacing residents or families, leaving buildings to 
become derelict, which threatens the vibrant ‘living heritage’ that Melaka 
owes it World Heritage Status to.  

Almost 45% of Melaka’s income is generated by the services & tourism 
sectors (including retail, food & beverage, accommodation) therefore loss 
of the UNESCO status would signi cantly affect the local economy and 
job opportunities. 

A stress is a daily or 
chronic challenge that 
weakens Melaka’s natural 
built, or human resources. 
Examples include 
climate change, aging 
infrastructure, inequality, 
poor economic conditions 
and air pollution. Stresses 
can amplify the effect of 
a shock when it occurs, 
particularly for vulnerable 
populations. 

Tra(cid:25)  c Congestion
Melaka experiences high levels of traf c congestion that stem from:  

•  A very weak and unattractive public transport network, unable to 
accommodate the travel demands of burgeoning visitor numbers, 
leading people to choose to travel by private vehicle. 

•  The road network has reached carrying capacity for car access into 

the city center. Cars need to pass through the narrow roads old city of 
Melaka to enter the city center, regularly creating bottlenecks.

•  A lack of parking signage can cause visitors to circulate many times 

in search for available parking spots. This increases the number of 
vehicles circulating the city. 

This is cause of concern for the economic, social and environmental 
health of Melaka:

•  60% of all CO2 emissions Melaka are caused by road transport, with 

adverse effects on both the environment and human health

•  Access for emergency services is poor during emergencies. 

•  Pedestrians’ safety in the WHS is compromised as cars are still trying to 

circulate in popular tourist areas.

A Lack of an Integrated Approach to Urban Planning
The urban area of Melaka is undergoing radical transformations that will 
affect its vulnerability to shocks and stresses in the decades to come. 
There is currently no optimal governance structure in place for planning, 
delivering and managing these major urban transformations in an 
integrated and coordinated manner.

This lack of integrated planning has resulted in : 

•  New developments have increased the amount of residents and 

businesses traveling through Melaka, placing increased burden on 
aging utility networks, and exacerbating the traf c. 

•  Flood risk has been increased as low lying land has been created along 

the coast and newly reclaimed areas. 

•  Reclaimed land had causes environmental degradation due to noise, 

loss of habitat and dredging, this is particularly noticeable in areas 
which used to be migratory birds stops and turtle landing sites.

Loss of Intangible Heritage
Heritage products, skills, customs are being lost as older generations 
pass on. Younger generations are not continuing their inherited 
family businesses or traditional skills, as heritage products are facing 
competition from more modern products.

As one interview stated “50% of heritage craft businesses have closed 
over the years, the owners are either already too old to operate the shop, 
or they can’t afford to pay the tax.”

Resilience Challenges

Opportunities to bring about change

The Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment also 
highlighted key areas of 
strength and opportunity 
for Melaka. 

These form the 
foundations from 
which we have built the 
vision and goals of this 
Resilience Strategy. 

Promoting an integrated approach to Melaka’s strategies and plans for 
future growth 
including the Local Plan, MBMB, Smart City Roadmap, MBMB Strategic 
Plan, Development Approval Planning, OSC processes and LCCF.

Community Engagement
Residents are increasingly aware that congestion and pollution risks 
could have a negative impact upon their lifestyles, livelihoods, and the 
future of their city.  They are now being more critical and using many 
mediums to channel their opinions to authorities.

Strengthening Melaka’s unique heritage to broaden its visitor o(cid:127) er, and 
diversifying the visitor economy
Tourism is af rming itself as a core sector of the City’s economy and 
– if correctly regulated and curated - will play a central role in building 
Melaka’s resilience.

Shared knowledge and being involved in city networks
There are many opportunities to learn from other cities in the 100 
Resilient Cities Network, and share Melaka’s efforts and progress with 
others. Many other municipal councils have already approached MBMB 
following its involvement in the 100 Resilient Cities Network, to  nd out 
more about their resilience activities. These include DBKL, Penang, Shah 
Alam, MERCY and others. 

A stress is a daily or 
chronic challenge that 
weakens Melaka’s natural 
built, or human resources. 
Examples include 
climate change, aging 
infrastructure, inequality, 
poor social cohesion and 
air pollution. Stresses 
can amplify the effect of 
a shock when it occurs, 
particularly for vulnerable 
populations. 

By addressing 
both the shocks 
and stresses, a city 
becomes more 
able to respond 
to adverse events, 
and is overall 
better able to 
function in both 
good times and 
bad, for all its 
residents. 

KEY STRESSES

Multiple Levels of Governance
Many of Melaka’s policies and projects are decided at the State level and 
not administered or developed in close coordination with MBMB. Major 
urban development projects (such as Melaka Gateway, HSR, and new 
Ports) do not fall within the jurisdiction of MBMB, although most of the 
impacts will affect the area administered by it.  The various agencies, 
service providers and local authority bodies do not always dialogue 
between themselves or share data effectively. Greater communication is 
needed to ensure stakeholders in Melaka are informed and engaged in 
changes. For example:

The Sungai Melaka project has been initiated by the State, with the 
river cruise service (a key source of revenue) managed by the State 
Corporation Company. However, responsibility for maintaining the 
infrastructure falls to MBMB. 

Con icting parking policies has emerged as the State has made parking 
free within Melaka City. However, this con icts with MBMB’s ambitions 
and policy to become a carbon free city. 

Solid Waste Management
Solid waste management practices in Melaka will not be sustainable in 
the long-term. There are only a few material-sorting facilities in Melaka, 
and the majority of waste is sent to land ll sites in Sungai Udang (which 
will soon be at capacity). Furthermore, despite programmes such as 
SWM’s 2+1 intiative, there is still limited awareness amongst residents, 
businesses or industries about recycling or waste segregation. Littering 
on the streets, in the river and the illegal disposal of solid waste 
exacerbates the issue of blocked drainage channels, and increases the 
risk of diseases spreading or epidemics.

Waste removal services in public spaces are poor - partly due to the 
dif culty in accessing narrow roads and properties, especially in 
the WHS. 

Aging Building & Infrastructure Conditions
A signi cant proportion of the heritage buildings within the WHS are 
fragile, and they can structurally be vulnerable to damage by rats or 
vibrations from moving vehicles. Aging utility infrastructure in the WHS is 
also leaving historic buildings vulnerable to drainage over ow, pests and 
electric  re.  

As stated in the Special Area Plan “the presence of many dilapidated 
and vacant buildings in the Core and Buffer Zones is worrying.” These 
buildings then become the most “vulnerable to change, often swept 
aside by new developments, converted into boutique hotels, or 
simply neglected.” 

Renovation and building retro ts need approval from the Heritage Board 
in MBMB. This is a long and strict approval process. Retro t solutions 
often require expensive methods to preserve the building, leading to 
high cost for maintenance, which becomes a heavy burdens for property 
tenants or owners.

Contributing to Local, National and 
International Ambitions

Resilient is closely aligned to the vision and objectives 
of Melaka’s Local Plan to ensure an integrated and 
holistic approach to resilient development in the city. 

Resilient Melaka has also been shaped by Malaysia’s 
national commitments to the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and New Urban Agenda (NUA).

This strategy will support the localization and ownership 
of the SDGs and NUA at the city level in Melaka. 

MBMB 2035 Local Plan

Melaka’s revised Local Plan outlines six ‘big moves’ 
to guide the development of Melaka a Smart, Green, 
Resilient, Dynamic and Sustainable City. The pillars 
and goals of Melaka’s Resilience Strategy align and 
complement these ‘big moves.’

New Urban Agenda (NUA)

The UN Habitat New Urban Agenda is an urbanization 
action blueprint for all cities and stakeholders 
to implement, in support of the 2030 agenda on 
Sustainable Development, especially targeted around 
making cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and 
sustainable.

Sustainable Development Goals

The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim 
to address the most pressing challenges of our time, 
including climate change, resource depletion, poverty 
and social justice. Cities will play an essential role in 
achieving the goals.

27. Melaka Data Observatory

SDG Goal 11.4

The Conservation Unit will lead the development of a map of 
intangible cultural heritage across Melaka. This will document local 
traditions, costumes, arts & crafts, events, celebrations, community 
stories and food of the traditional Malays, Chinese, Indians and other 
ethnic groups in Melaka, to strengthen our knowledge, and raise 
awareness of the richness of the various cultures in our city.

There is currently very little documentation capturing the diversity of 
cultures and histories within Melaka in an accessible way. This Action 
will enable the city to value and recognize the cultural and religious 
diversity of Melaka, as a melting-pot of Asian and European in uences, 
and to revive the historical value of the WHS and Melaka Historical City. 

Information and data will be collected through a combination of 
face-to-face interviews and surveys. The questions and format of the 
engagement should be co-produced with cultural institutions, schools 
and heritage bodies, as to capture the right information, one needs 
to ask the right questions. These questions should be sensitive to 
considerations of ethnicity, occupation, age, multi-culturalism, tensions 
and aspirations. 

 

       

The cultural heritage map will combine existing documentation on 
built heritage and new information on intangible heritage. The map will 
be made publicly available on an interactive online platform, which will 
be promoted through websites, roadshows, events and festivals, local 
museums, mobile applications, television advertisements and printed 
or social media. 

The cultural heritage map will provide evidence on key trends which 
can be used to inform decisions regarding heritage planning, building 
restoration, and promoting cultural activities in the WHS. The cultural 
heritage map will also inform the initiatives proposed in Actions 2+3.

Resilience Value

•  Supports the dissemination of culture, values, intangible heritage
•  Records cultural practices and skills for posterity
•  Strengthens cultural identity of the city 

•  Promotes Melaka as a diverse visitor destination

Next Steps

Key pilot areas and community groups for engagement have been 
identi ed. The Conservation Unit and Implementation Partners will 
now seek resources and funding for the full program of data collection 
and dissemination. The Resilience Unit will support in communicating 
the value of this platform to a broad range of stakeholders, 
emphasizing the role the community map plays in connecting people 
with Melaka’s intangible cultural heritage, and in improving livelihoods 
within the heritage and tourism sectors.

SDG Goal 11.4

This action brings together various initiatives to raise awareness of 
Melaka’s unique heritage values amongst residents and visitors. Each 
initiative aims to support local heritage businesses and associations in 
sharing Melaka’s unique cultural heritage story.

Initiatives could involve:

• 

• 

 Extending Melaka’s calendar of cultural heritage events and 
festivals, to celebrate a broader variety of histories and cultures in 
Melaka;

SDG Goals 8.9 and 11.4

We want to revive and support our traditional crafts and products. 
Many traditional trades and heritage businesses are facing signi cant 
competition from businesses selling inauthentic plastic modern 
products to visitors. 

We want to provide incentives to artisans to market and sell their 
products and promote a high quality brand for Melaka’s 
traditional crafts. 

This involves: 

•  Prioritizing heritage products businesses when renting MBMB 

owned stalls;

•  Supporting efforts to bring vacant  oors or buildings back into 
use to create spaces for new cultural uses, artisan studios, and 
traditional trade, retail or food businesses in the WHS;

•  Establishing an accreditation or labeling scheme to distinguish 
goods and services which adhere to high quality principles and 
recognized heritage of WHS;

•  Providing support for promoting and marketing products from 

small heritage businesses;

Inviting local  lm productions to showcase the authentic heritage 
businesses and products through movies or TV programs.

These initiatives aim to address the poor ‘visibility’ of traditional trades 
to visitors, and leverage their potential as part of the visitor offer.

Resilience Value

•  Protects and preserves local traditional skills and knowledge

•  Supports the dissemination of culture, values and 

intangible heritage

•  Strengthens cultural identity of the city 

•  Promotes Melaka as a diverse visitor destination

Next Steps

Licensing and Business Development Department (MBMB) to 
collaborate with relevant stakeholders from the State-level and BPP to 
identify framework for promoting heritage products. Resilience Unit to 
assist in engaging and consulting with artisans in focus 
group discussions.

Heritage products, skills, customs are being lost as older generations 
pass on.  We want to revive and support our traditional crafts through 
collaboration with schools, universities, and adult education 
training institutions.

This could involve:

•  Developing a program of skills training within a variety of 

education institutions through partnerships with arts organizations 
and cultural producers;

• 

Introducing cultural and performing arts education at an early age;

engage schools and local institutions to identify a diverse program of 
craft skills initiatives suitable for different ages. This will involve also 
identifying local institutions capable of delivering the required craft 
skills training, which may involve individual stakeholders such as local 
shop owners and craft-people. The Resilience Unit can provide initial 
seed funding to support pilot engagement with education institutions.

Next Steps

Department of City Beauti cation. 
(MBMB) and SWCorp to collaborate in 
identifying key waste issues to inform the 
campaign, then agree a course of action 
and aligned KPIs for a waste public 
awareness campaign. The Resilience Unit 
will draw upon resilience cities networks 
to invite international experts during a 
cross-agency waste forum. 

We will develop an enhanced awareness raising campaign to 
encourage residents, visitors and business to recycle and dispose 
of waste responsibly. This campaign will aim to increase public 
understanding of the impact of littering and untreated waste in 
drainage channels, for both environmental and human health. 

This will involve: 

•  Developing innovative visual campaigns, television and radio 
advertisements,  yers, mobile apps to encourage responsible 
waste disposal and recycling;

•  Fostering synergy in combined efforts between MBMB, SWCorp 

and SWM Environment Sdn Bhd in coordinated campaigns on 
sustainable waste awareness;

•  Organizing clean-up drives in the city, to raise awareness and 

increase public action;

•  Engaging with tourists to be more environmentally responsible 

when visiting Melaka – through e.g. promotion videos, additional 
waste bins on river boats and in key visitor locations;

•  Providing more segregated waste bins in public spaces - to 
maximize the bene ts and avoid public confusion, it will be 
essential to strategically design and locate the bins. We will use 
international best practices to apply color coding, symbols and 
shaped openings (e.g. rectangular slit for paper, round opening for 
glass and plastics) that can be easily recognized and understood. 
Recycling bins should also be designed to  t in with the 
surrounding area, and concentrated in areas with high pedestrian 
 ow, for example near cafes and restaurants, shopping precincts 
and event venues;

• 

Initiating more recycling education in local schools. This will involve 
building upon the Eco Schools program and developing a more 
sustained program of engagement with schools.

Resilience Value

•  Reduces tonnes of domestic and commercial waste that goes to 

land ll, reducing the cost of environmental clean-up 
and rehabilitation

•  Reduces risk to human health

•  Demonstrates environmental responsibility and promotes 

stewardship by citizens

of our community. We will develop awareness raising campaigns to 
help local residents, tourists and small business to understand how 
their water is supplied, and the impact of water pollution on human 
and environmental health. This campaign will be designed and 
delivered to encourage water-saving behavior.  

This will involve: 

•  Developing innovative visual campaigns, television and radio 

advertisements,  yers, mobile apps to encourage water saving and 
sustainable water management practices;

•  Providing incentives and water ef cient technologies to property 

owners to retro t existing buildings with water saving devices;

•  School outreach activities to promote sustainable and responsible 

water usage among students of all ages;

•  Strengthening the promotion of green development certi cations 

for new developments to include rainwater harvesting, water 
metering charging according to water use, and sustainable water 
consumption technologies;

 Engaging hotels (as major consumers of water resources) to 
reduce water consumption as part of their licensing renewal 
process.

Resilience Value

•  Reduces the demand on Melaka’s diminishing water supply 

•  Reduces the cost of environmental water quality clean-up and 

rehabilitation

•  Demonstrates environmental responsibility and promotes 

stewardship by citizens

Next Steps

Department of Engineering (MBMB) to convene a cross-agency 
working group to identify key objectives and focus areas for raising 
awareness of water usage in Melaka. Once the objectives for a 
campaign have been established, technical assistance from specialist 
NGOs will be required to develop an action plan which actively 
engages residents in water management issues.

The Resilient Unit will support by initiating conversations on water 
conservation and rain water harvesting with a variety of key audiences 
(i.e. MBMB and municipal agencies, hotels and industry organizations 
and individual property owners).

cleanliness programs to improve water quality, 
involving our community, local agencies and 
international support.   

SDG Goals 3.3 and 6.3

We will develop a targeted local public campaign to increase 
awareness of disease transmission through poor sanitary conditions.

Recorded cases of Food Poisoning, Tuberculosis, Hand, Foot and 
Mouth Disease, Leptospirosis and Dengue have reached signi cant 
levels in Melaka in recent years. These can easily be prevented through 
simple actions to ensure healthy environments.

We will collaborate with health agencies, water agencies, schools and 
marketing specialists to develop a campaign to encourage ownership 
of public health issues, and ensure a long-lasting result.

This will involve: 

• 

 Educating the public in their role in preventing the transmission 
of harmful bacteria or viruses in speci c contexts (e.g. food 
preparation, schools, hospitality businesses, waste disposal and 
water environments);

•  Developing innovative visual campaigns, television and radio 

advertisements,  yers, mobile apps to increase the awareness of 
healthy sanitation behaviors;

• 

• 

Improving pollution monitoring and action squads. This could 
include setting up volunteer programs and teams like Search 
and Destroy Aedes Ranger (SEDAR) Program in Selangor. Here, 
volunteers assist local authorities in inspecting their housing and 
commercial areas for potential mosquito breeding grounds;

 Raising awareness of cleanliness best practice amongst business 
owners in the WHS, especially those working in the food, beverage 
and hotel industries. This will include investigating opportunities to 
formalize and enforce existing license renewal process and  ning 
processes.

Resilience Value

•  Ensures public health and wellbeing

•  Reduces risk to human health for both residents and visitors

Next Steps

Department of Environmental Health to collaborate closely with 
Melaka State Health Department and convene a cross-agency working 
group to de ne the objectives, target audiences and focus areas of the 
public health campaign. The Town Hall sessions should be considered 
as a platform to engage business owners. A pilot initiative will focus 
on engaging WHS business owners. This can be replicated with other 
groups if needed.

SDG Goals 11.b and 13.3

We will work to build Melaka’s community’s risk awareness and 
capacity to respond to unforeseen emergency events through 
community training programs. We will target the highest risk areas 
 rst.

This will involve: 

•  Developing age-sensitive programs of awareness raising and 

emergency drills across all educational institutions;

•  Training property owners to mitigate and manage risks associated 

with  re and  ooding;

•  Encouraging business property owners to establish clear 

evacuation procedures and routes; 

• 

 Developing neighborhood networks of volunteers through the 
Kawasan Rukun Tetangga (KRT) program, that are trained to 
respond immediate to possible shocks or natural hazards (for 
example,  ooding). These volunteer networks will be trained 
to maintain safety, especially for the most vulnerable, through 
established technical procedures, until the situation is controlled 
by the responsible authorities; 

•  Developing a pilot program, initially training owners of old historic 

properties in the WHS. This is particularly important as many 
buildings are vulnerable to building failure,  ooding, and are often 
built back-to-back which poses a risk for emergency services and 
evacuation. We will then develop a comprehensive program of 
community risk awareness training to be delivered across Melaka.

Resilience Value

• 

• 

• 

 Improves coordination in the case of an emergency, to maximizes 
public safety and disaster preparedness 
 Better sense of ownership and community by actively participating

 Enables property owners to recover and minimize damage 
following a  re or  ood event

• 

 Reduces loss of life and property damages

Next Steps

property owners with assistance from MBMB and Jonker Walk 
Traders Association (to identify participants for the training). MBMB 
Emergency Response Depts. will then collaborate with implementation 
partners to secure funding and expertise to develop a Melaka-wide

SDG Goals 11.6, 11.3, 16.7 and 16.8

There have been cases in recent years where State-led policy has 
needed greater communication with the residents of Melaka to ensure 
residents are informed of, and engaged with changes in their city.

We will enhance and improve the existing Mayor’s Town Hall forum 
format to ensure broader public engagement and discussion.  This will 
involve: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

 Establishing a variety of public locations for meetings;

 Ensuring multiple social media platforms and various public 
outreach approaches are used to publicize the events, and ensure 
a more diverse range of participants;

Connected City

Goals & Actions

Improvements to our urban spaces, infrastructure and 
mobility networks can address many of the shocks and 
stresses facing Melaka. Investing in making the city safer, 
more accessible and a more vibrant place to work and 
play will also help protect against ﬂ ood risk, facilitate 
social interaction and create healthier environments for 
communities. These improvements can provide signiﬁ cant 
beneﬁ ts for Melaka’s residents’ quality of life, but also 
it enhances the attractiveness of Melaka for visitors and 
investors.
We want to ensure everyone in the city - residents 
and visitors - has access to public transport. This will 
reduce congestion and improve air pollution.  Improved 
accessibility around the city will help create new business 
opportunities. It can also provide opportunitites to adapt 
and re-use spaces to enhance the character of the city.
A resilience approach prioritizes infrastructure and urban 
space solutions that are integrated and tactical. Integrated 
in terms of addressing multiple risks at once – through a 
coordination across silos – all the while achieving long-
term beneﬁ ts. Tactical, in the sense that certain small-scale 
actions are able to achieve broad and ambitious goals.

SDG Goals 9.1. and 11.2

We will collaborate across transport and infrastructure agencies to 
develop an Integrated Mobility Masterplan that integrates all current 
studies and plans (ADB and Parking Studies as well as the Melaka 
State Structure plan and local plans) and provides an implementation 
roadmap for mobility improvements in Melaka. This masterplan will 
support and align with the UNESCO World Heritage Site conservation 
objectives.

The mobility system in Melaka is facing a number of signi cant 
challenges, including limited public transport options, over reliance on 
private care use, narrow streets, and limited regional access to points 
of interest throughout the city, including the WHS. Therefore, a more 
coordinated approach is needed to integrate the various land-uses and 
points of interest across the city.

SDG Goal 9.1

MBMB and Panorama Melaka will develop an upgraded bus service 
that contributes to a more integrated city transport network that 
incorporates ‘Park and Ride’ and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) options for 
both residents and visitors.

This will involve MBMB:  

•  opening a new tender for the bus service;

•  upgrading the facilities and condition of the existing bus terminal 

and bus stop to ensure convenient and safety for users;

•  identifying suitable locations for the Park and Ride terminals;

•  conducting a feasibility study to identify the suitable routes for a 

BRT  service, and the implementation of a BRT proposal;

•  identifying school and university service routes;

•  ensuring state-subsidies for the service are targeted effectively;

•  requiring bus operators to move to zero or low carbon fueled 

vehicles.

This will also involve the bus operator Panorama: 

•  improving branding and marketing of the bus system and wider 

public transport network;

•  establishing Smart Information Systems - to reduce wait times, and 

make the service more user-friendly.

Resilience Value

•  Provide a safe and affordable public transport system to reduce 
reliance on the car, and encourage alternative modes of transport

•  Enhance accessibility for citizens to goods and services, through a 

comprehensive public transport system

•  Reduce emissions from cars and improve air quality and 

public health

•  Contribute to Melaka’s aspirations of: ef ciency, inclusivity 

and sustainability

Next Steps

MBMB Department of Engineering and Panorama State GLC will 
collaborate and secure technical and  nancial assistance to conduct 
a scoping and feasibility assessments for the hybrid bus and 
BRT network. 

The Resilience Unit will assist in ensuring bus networks and Park+Ride 
service plans are aligned and integrated with related pedestrianization 
and river taxi projects.   Where necessary, the Resilience Unit can 
invite external BRT and transport planning experts from across the 100 
Resilient Cities network as part of a capacity building and knowledge-
sharing program.

SDG Goals 9.1 and 11.2

MBMB will continue to develop alternative and multi-modal routes into 
Melaka to ease congestion on the main routes into the city. Currently, 
there are only a few roads leading to the city center. Alternative routes 
into the city, and WHS area in particular, are therefore needed to 
improve local and regional access for both residents and visitors. 

There is insuf cient data on current and forecasted road capacity and 
traf c volumes. MBMB will therefore conduct a feasibility study to 
identify suitable new routes into the city and ensure: 

•  New ‘green’ routes into the city are coordinated with planned BRT, 

park and ride and cycle networks, to develop an integrated multi-
modal mobility system across the city, and reduce reliance on 
private vehicles;

•  Traf c impact assessments are conducted on existing and 

potential routes;

•  This action is informed by an evidence-based appraisal of potential 

options, considering the environmental, social and economy 
bene ts of alternative routes.

This study should coordinate both the road diversion plans proposed 
by MBMB’s Local Plan, and planned UK Prosperity Fund interventions 
for a Green Transport Corridor Melaka.

SDG Goals 9.1 and 11.2 

We will work with existing operators to develop a ‘hop-on-hop-off’ 
Water Taxi service along the Melaka River as an alternative means of 
transport through the city. This service will be separate to the river 
cruise service, and will provide both residents and visitors with a link 
from Melaka Sentral, into the WHS. 

This project will be closely aligned with the Sungai Melaka Phase II 
infrastructure improvements, and initiatives to pedestrianize the WHS. 

Preliminary work will have to take place to reinforce the concrete river 
walls, as wave action from passing taxi boats may cause erosion and 
weaken the wall structural integrity.

Resilience Value

•  Provides a sustainable and alternative means of transport, 
extending connectivity and transport options through the 
city center

•  Enhances the city identity and supports tourism

•  Fosters long-term & integrated planning

Next Steps

effective drop-off locations along the river. Resilience Unit to 
coordinate with PPSPM to ensure an integrated approach to planning, 
(i.e.) infra-structure upgrades are coordinated with  ood mitigation 
improvements, and drop-off points are aligned with key pedestrian 
access or park and ride locations to bene t both residents and 
visitors. Where necessary the Resilience Unit may be able to draw 
upon experts within the 100 Resilient Cities network to share advice 
and experience in implementing water transport and infrastructure 
projects.

SDG Goals 3.4 9.1, 11.2, 11.3, and 11.7

We will develop cycle and pedestrian networks throughout Melaka. 
We will prioritize key areas such as the riverside and key tourist and 
employment areas, whilst also ensuring new routes are created linking 
villages, townships and public parks across the city. 

As part of the joined-up network, Melaka will need to consider the key 
‘last mile connection’ as Melaka’s residents move safely to and from 
the WHS. Understanding and designing the ideal structure of this 
network will also involve participatory processes, speci cally when 
preparing user-friendly standards and regulations for pedestrians and 
cyclists.

The Healthy Walkable Guideline City (GPPHWC), provided by 
PLANMalaysia will be a key reference document when preparing the 
standards and regulations for pedestrian and cycle ways, and cycling 
parking facilities. These guidelines provide best practice advice on 
implementing Healthy Walkable City solutions at both the city and 
neighborhood scale.

 Resilience Value

•

 Builds social cohesion - walkable neighborhoods have higher 
levels of social capital compared to those living in the car-oriented 
suburbs. They are more likely to know their neighbors, trust each 
other, and be socially committed (Leyden, 2003)

Next Steps

Identify priority pedestrian and cycle routes within areas of interest 
that will support the integrated mobility plan. Resilience Unit to 
collaborate with the Engineering and Planning Departments to 
review and assess options in order to ensure this project is closely 
coordinated with other public realm and mobility strategies to ensure 
cross-sector bene ts are realized. The Resilience Unit can also provide

SDG Goals 8.9 and 9.1

MBMB will implement a pedestrian priority scheme throughout the 
streets of the World Heritage Site in order to create a safe, accessible 
and sustainable means of accessing the area, whilst also indirectly 
supporting a wider range of community and visitor activities.

Components of the pedestrian priority scheme may include: 

•  Parking restriction and a residents parking scheme;

•  Timed servicing access for deliveries and waste collection;

•  Decentralized parking, and a Park and Ride service;

•  A Street Lighting Strategy, to improve safety and security;

•  Paving and street furniture to enhance heritage values and 

conservation objectives;

•  Improved signage and way nding; 

•  Tactical urbanism approaches, where small scale and low-cost 

interventions are developed in collaboration with residents, and 
used to temporarily pedestrianize spaces.

By reducing vehicle traf c passing through the WHS, public space 
can be created for alternative visitor activities (in side streets and 
back lanes for example). Themed visitor trails or circuits can also be 
developed extending within and around the WHS. Visitors are also 
more likely to spend longer in the WHS and its surrounds, exploring 
smaller shops or back lanes, leading to increased tourism revenue.

This will be phased progressively to minimize disruption and build 
public support. It will also be closely coordinated with controlled 
traf c management or public transport initiatives.  

Aligned to City Plans
MBMB Local Plan 2035

Resilience Value

•  Improves safety for pedestrians

•  Strengthens efforts to preserve heritage buildings as vibrations 

from passing traf c are reduced

•  Increases time spent walking in WHS which can deepen visitors’ 
engagement with Melaka’s culture, history and environment, and 
support local businesses 

Next Steps

The Action Owners will assess locations for priority pilot streets, whilst 
ensuring they are integrated with other transport and public realm 
strategies. This will be supported by the Resilience Unit, who will:

•  Assist the Action Owners to secure budget for implementation;

•  Arrange public consultation and engagement opportunities to 

ensure pedestrianization pilots meet the needs of local business 
owners and residents;

•  Provide advice on implementing pilot projects through Tactical 

Urbanism methods.

SDG Goals 9.1 and 11.7 

Across the center of Melaka, especially within the WHS, and along the 
Melaka River, opportunities exist to revitalize vacant and under-used 
public spaces. We want to ensure these spaces are built-back-better, 
to serve the community, without high levels of cost. 

This could include: 

•  Exploring temporary and small-scale interventions to reinvent 
spaces with citizens. These could include such as greening and 
public art initiatives, or shop front improvements;

•  Creating semi-permanent and pop-up murals (to avoid damage to 

historical walls and buildings);

•  Designating areas of vacant land for commercial use to attract 

new SME businesses to neighbor-hoods (prioritized for economic 
revitalization);

•  Improving public realm and pavements delivering safe, joined-

up walking network (including broader visitor circuits and linking 
across the buffer area, tree canopy walk/cycle lanes).

These revived public spaces should be designed to offer multiple 
functions – for example:

•  Public space could be designed to mitigate  ash  oods in  ood-

prone areas;

•  In areas where young people congregate, street furniture may need 

to be designed to withstand skateboarding activities;

•  Public space could be designed to offer rest points and shade to 

pedestrians. 

Resilience Value

•  Regeneration of central sites reduces urban sprawl and revives 

activity in the city center

•  Supports conditions to increase employment and services 

•  Revitalizing public spaces through recreational, cultural or 

sporting activities provides bene ts including strengthening social 
cohesion.

•  Enhances urban conservation value

Next Steps

Departments of Engineering and Environment, MBMB will work 
with community groups and property owners to survey and identify 
potential spaces, create an inventory and design a program of 
interventions. The Resilience Unit will support this work, with a 
particular focus on engaging the public in co-creating solutions and 
using tactical urbanism methods to test pilots.

SDG Goals 9.1 and 11.4

Melaka has several rivers, with riverbank areas that could provide 
attractive public spaces for activities. We will coordinate with the 
existing Sungai Melaka Phase II improvement works to ensure riverside 
spaces are revived to support community and economic activities. 
MBMB will  rst develop a pilot project as part of the Sungai Melaka 
Phase II project. 

This will require MBMB to engage public and private agencies, 
responsible for drainage, public realm, waste, water and waste water 
infrastructure, to ensure an integrated and successful approach to 
planning public spaces along the river.  Community engagement 
and consultation will also be essential in designing successful public 
spaces. Through engagment and consultations, there are opportunities 
to integrate tactical urbanism approaches – where temporary small 
scale interventions can be used to reinvent spaces with citizens.

Following the successful of pilot projects, there are opportunities to 
extend this approach for reviving public spaces along other rivers

as a public park. 

Signi cant rehabilitation work will  rst be needed to ensure the site 
is suitable and safe for public use. This will address the environmental 
degradation on the site, and restore natural habits. This is particularly 
important due to the site’s proximity to the Melaka River, and issues of 
leachate and water contamination. A feasibility study is therefore  rst 
required, to identify suitable environmental restoration solutions for 
the site.

Once rehabilitation works have been completed, the site will then 
be developed as a public park, providing residents and visitors with 
access to green space in the city.

Resilience Value

•  Restores natural ecosystems, landscapes and biodiversity

•  Enhances attractiveness of Melaka to residents and visitors

•  Potentially provides residents with access to green spaces in urban

Special Area Plan, MBMB

To bring back vacant or abandoned 
heritage buildings into sustainable use for 
a living and working community. 

SDG Goals 8.9 and 11.4

There is a need for strategy that ensures Melaka’s historical urban 
fabric serves as an asset rather than a liability for the city.  There is 
also a need to identify affordable restoration techniques for property 
owners to implement, potentially supported by incentives.

This should:

•  Identify appropriate re-use and conservation options with property 

owners; 

•  Consider incentives to bring vacant  oors or buildings back into use;

•  Guides infrastructure retro tting or upgrade programs within 

sensitive heritage buildings or public realm;

•  Improve living conditions and encourages a social mix of residents 

and to stay living in the WHS to support its preservation and 
continued vibrancy;

•  This project will establish a framework, in partnership with the 

property owners, heritage experts and MBMB planning department, 
to guide the restoration of historic buildings, ensuring they are 
livable whilst preserving the authenticity and integrity of the historic 
urban fabric.

Next Steps
Department of Irrigation and Drainage, 
Melaka to secure technical and  nancial 
assistance to prepare the plan, and gain 
agreement for collaboration between 
other states. The Resilience Unit will 
support this work by ensuring a multi-
stakeholder collaborative approach in 
developing the Watershed plan. Where 
needed the Resilience Unit can also 
support in public consultation activities.

SDG Goal  11.b

We will develop a Watershed Management Plan for Melaka to inform 
an integrated approach to water resource management, land use 
planning and  ood risk mitigation in the city. This will be used to 
inform key land use planning stakeholders and the State Government 
to ensure local and national economic, societal and environmental 
targets are met with regards to water resources and  ood risk. 

Several  ood-related studies and assessments have been conducted in 
Melaka. However, an integrated, cross-boundary approach is needed 
to improve decision making for water resource management.

This Watershed Management Plan will: 

•  assess the wider watershed or catchment area serving Melaka’s 

rivers and waterbodies; 

•  provide a framework for protecting and enhancing the water 

environment and therefore, inform decisions on land-use planning; 

•  identify the existing water quality conditions and any potential risks;

•  identify any protected or sensitive areas that need to be considered 

when managing water resources; 

•  integrate and align with the Water Resource Conservation Plan 

(WRCP) and National Water Balance Study (NAWABS) prepared for 
the Sungai Melaka River Basin;

The  ndings of the Watershed Management Plan may be 
able highlight: 

•  areas where improvements in water quality could be achieved by 
more consistent, and enforced regulation and planning between 
different states;

•  areas in which smart and sustainable designs could achieve multiple 

bene ts, such as improved water quality, reduced  ash  ood risk, 
and reduced impact of sewer systems becoming  ooded during 
high rainfall events.

Once the Watershed Management Plan is published, the  ndings 
should be shared with local Infrastructure, Environmental Protection, 
Transport and Planning departments in MBMB, to ensure an integrated 
approach to decision making for public service planning and 
construction permits. The plan should also be read in conjunction 
with utility water supply & distribution, storm & foul drainage network 
information, reports on works in the marine environment, biodiversity 
plans, and proposed future development plans. 

Resilience Value

•  Provides information to lower the risk of property damage, 

business loss, and reparation costs from  ooding

•  Ensures an integrated approach to land use,  ood risk and water 

resource planning

SDG Goal 6.a and 11.b

Multiple (but coordinated) approaches are needed to strengthen 
Melaka’s  ood mitigation infra-structure and improve the city’s 
drainage system:

•  An assessment study to understand the upgrade required for the 
tidal barrage and pump system to manage water levels. This will 
help capture and treat runoff at source before reaching 
downstream areas; 

•  A SUDs (Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems) feasibility study 

to identifying priority areas + feasible retro tting solutions to 
incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems to reduce surface water 
 ow before it enters watercourses, in an environmentally 
bene cial way;

•  Development of a maintenance program for drainage systems 

including asset mapping and monitoring; 

•  An assessment identifying new (affordable) technologies that can 
access drainage channels in hard-to-reach areas that are prone to 
becoming blocked with solid waste. Easy and regular maintenance 
of drainage channels could greatly reduce the risk of localized 
 ooding.

Natural or nature-based solutions will be preferred, but without 
neglecting the importance of ICT or smart solutions to improve the 
continuous monitoring and support emergency  ood management.

Resilience Value

•  Helps to reduce and manage surface water  ow into the drainage 

network

•  Resolves or limits the effects of urban  ooding 

•  Helps to raise awareness of climate change 

Next Steps

MBMB stakeholders will secure technical and  nancial assistance 
to conduct these three assessments, whilst identifying priority 
locations to be addressed. The Resilience Unit will support the public 
consultation processes in areas prone to  ooding and poor drainage to 
ensure building owners can participate in relevant decision-making.

SDG Goals 6.b and 6.3

A signi cant number of households in Melaka do not have regular 
or adequate waste collection services, especially in rural areas. 
Typically, these households will bury their waste, or burn it, resulting in 
environmental degradation, pollution and increased harm to 
human health.

MBMB will ensure greater ef ciency and coordination for waste 
collection services in rural areas, through collaboration with outside 
contractors and specialist NGOs. This will involve:

•  Collaborating with SWCorp to establish regular waste collection 
in rural areas. This should reduce the costs associated with using 
external contractors;

•  Improving scheduling to collection services are both regular but 

ef cient. This will involve identifying effective low-cost waste 
collection logistic solutions;

•  Collaborating with local waste NGOs (such as Tzu Chi Foundation), 

to buy recycling from residents, to reduce incentives to  y-tip or 
dump waste illegally.

We will draw upon national and international expertise to identify 
solutions relevant for both urban and rural areas of Melaka.

Resilience Value

•  Reduces environmental and human health risks

• 

• 

 Ensures continuity of critical services for sanitation and

SDG Goals 11.6 and 17.7

We will collaborate with key stakeholders in SPAN and IWK to ensure 
both private and public Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) are licensed, 
maintained and regulated more effectively.  

Sewage treatment plants are often poorly maintained, resulting in 
cases of leaching, water pollution and environmental damage.  This 
has severe consequences for both human and environmental health. 

SPAN, MBMB stakeholders and the Resilience Unit will conduct further 
research to understand the opportunities to improve the current 
situation through: 

•  the licensing process;

•  audit and maintenance processes;

•  fees and regulations;

•  costs and incentives to upgrade facilities.

Government agencies and municipal buildings (including schools) will 
be a priority area of focus. Cross-sector collaboration is required to 
bring the complex issue of STP management to the attention of local, 
state and federal agencies.

Resilience Value

•  Ensures continuity of critical services for sanitation and public 

health

•  Improves environmental health and water quality of rivers

Next Steps

The Resilience Unit and SPAN will initiate a series of focus group 
discussions with all relevant stakeholders to better understand the 
issues, causes and barriers to action in improving STP governance. 
These discussions will inform program of actions to improve waste 
water and STP management.

To create an e(cid:157) ective platform that 
integrates data from various agencies 
in Melaka, to share expertise and 
technology and facilitate a transparent, 
responsive, and well-informed society. 

SDG Goals 9.c, 16.6 and 16.10

We will develop MBMB’s iShare data platform into a comprehensive 
data observatory to collect and share data across various agencies 
in Melaka.  This will ensure an increasingly evidenced-based and 
integrated approach to decision-making in the city. 

We will  rst focus on ensuring updated spatial data is available 
and easily shared to be able to manage risk ( ood and  re), traf c 
congestion, and solid waste in an integrated way. This will involve 
developing appropriate system architecture and infrastructure that is: 

•  compatible and easy to use for all departments;

•  continuously updated, to ensure the data collected and analyzed 

represents reality, as much as possible;

•  shared, to ensure knowledge is disseminated - providing a platform 

to collaborate.

In parallel, a capacity building program will be developed to ensure 
MBMB stakeholders are trained to manage, maintain and analyze the 
data to support them in decision making.  

As a second stage, we aim to open this data platform to other state 
and private agencies operating in Melaka, and the public.  In the 
long-term the city can look to develop a ‘real-time city observatory’ 
providing city decision-makers with real-time data to manage  ood 
risk, water quality, air quality or traf c congestion for example. 

By sharing data and making it easily available, the coordination and 
collaboration between agencies and stakeholders can be enhanced. 
This will facilitate better planning decisions, for a quality of life for 
residents. It will also help the Municipality to direct its resources 
where they are needed most, through a better understanding of city 
challenges (e.g. traf c congestion, parking availability, or water leaks).

Resilience Value

•  Facilitates greater ef ciency in administration, as time spent 

retrieving information is reduced, and it decreases the replication 
of data and information

• 

 Establishes the foundations for an long-term, integrated and 
ef cient to manage mobility, and potentially crisis management

Next Steps

Resilience Unit to work with Department of Town Planning and other 
key stakeholders to ensure data and platform development is suited 
to analyzing key resilience issues (such  ood,  re, traf c congestion 
and solid waste). The Resilience Unit can also bring in learning from 
across the resilience cities network to ensure implementation partners 
are informed of the bene ts associated with an integrated approach to

Academic stakeholders such as professors, students and researchers 
are continually implementing studies and innovative projects that 
address important issues for the city of Melaka. 

Universities in Melaka, for example, are particularly strong in 
engineering, robotics and technology research and designs, which 
could provide the city with solutions to infrastructure, drainage and 
 ooding challenges.

MBMB will proactively establish opportunities to consolidate the 
existing links between MBMB and universities and identify research 
and educational projects within the city that could attract other 
researchers from across Melaka State and Malaysia.

This can be achieved by connecting university professors, laboratories 
and students with municipal departments and opening two-way 
channels of communications (e.g. through co-organizing master 
classes, events, conferences) to sustain on-going dialogues with the 
academic community.

There is also the opportunity for MBMB and university departments 
to develop topic-speci c design competitions, to apply research and 
prototypes to real city problems. This format has been particularly 
effective in developing proposals for unused plots of land in 
Johor Bahru. 

To date, the city has been developing collaborations on an ad hoc 
basis. We will now establish standardized and long-term collaborations 
with universities.  

Resilience Value

•  Supports integrated planning and strengthen municipal leadership

•  Supports data-driven policy making

Next Steps

departments to identify relevant stake-holders and courses to 
collaborate on city-priority areas. The Resilience Unit will support 
MBMB Departments in university outreach activities and to support in 
developing R&D competitions to tackle Melaka’s resilience challenges.

City Development

Develop improved coordination mechanisms and 
processes to enable the sharing and exchange 
of knowledge, technologies, and facilitate an 
integrated approach to improving water, waste 
and ﬂ ood risk management.

SDG Goals 11.a, 16.7, 17.9, 17.16 and 17.17 

We will seek to improve coordination across agencies responsible for 
 ood risk, water and waste management, with a particular focus on: 

•  Data Sharing – to ensure asset, maintenance, and risk assessment 

data held by each agency can be easily accessed by others;

•  Coordinating Maintenance Works - greater communication 

between agencies, to ensure maintenance works are coordinated 
will help reduce pressures on resources and reduce the number of 
visits required but improve ef ciency in meeting different targets;

•  Coordinating Monitoring systems -  for changes in water quality 

and water levels; 

•  Training and Continual Professional Development (CPD) for 

capacity building and increased awareness across all parties. This 
could include formal education and training, informal learning, 
conferences and technical meetings, presentation of research or 
sharing best practice across agencies. Expertise and collaboration 
with professional bodies (such as Malaysia Institute of Engineering, 
Waste Management Association of Malaysia, Malaysian Water 
Association, Malaysian Institute of Planners, and others) will be 
important here.

We will develop a cross-agency working committee to coordinate 
water and waste management at a city-level. 

Resilience Value

•  Supports integrated planning and strengthens municipal 

leadership

• 

• 

• 

 Improves evidence-based coordination and management 

 Reduces maintenance costs through time saving opportunities

 Reduces  ood risk

Next Steps

UPEN Melaka, with MBMB stakeholder support, will convene a cross-
department working group to identify potential ways to collaborate 
across Waste, Water and Engineering Departments, to coordinate 
maintenance works and capacity building programs.

Implementation & Next Steps

Embedding Resilience in MBMB

Our efforts will now turn to implementing the actions 
described in this strategy.

The Resilience Unit will lead the collaboration with 
various experts, public agencies, government 
authorities and community groups.

Mayor 

Melaka Historic 

City Council 

(MBMB) 

Now we have developed the Resilient 
Melaka strategy, the real work 
can start! 
We recognize that this strategy is ambitious. But we 
believe we can collaborate, through local, national 
and international partnerships, to implement these 
action in Melaka.

The initiatives included in the document are 
expected to inspire actors, from local, state 
and federal government, international  nancial 
institutions and research organizations, to realize 
these projects and take part in building a resilient, 
engaged, vibrant and smart Melaka for the future. 

This strategy will serve as the foundation for 
working with these partners, providing a coherent 
and thoughtful road map for action and innovation.

This strategy can also be used as tool to engage 
investors and obtain funding commitments to 
unlock the necessary resources to make these 
actions a reality.

The Resilience Unit is well placed, to work an 
interdisciplinary manner, across multiple sectors, and 
to draw upon the knowledge and expertise of resilience 
experts across the world. 

However, long-lasting improvements in how our city 
functions will only come about if these resilience actions 
are embraced and owned throughout MBMB and other 
key institutions, and not just within one municipal of ce.

Partnership and collaboration is fundamental in 
building resilience. 

The resilience challenges Melaka faces are complex. 
The Resilience Unit will therefore work to discard the 
silos that exist between different department and 
agencies in order to: 

•  Obtain multiple perspectives and approaches

•  Leverage the resources and expertise of 

multiple stakeholders. 

Shared 

Experience and 
Knowledge from 

municipalities 
across Malaysia 
and the 100RC 

Network 

Melaka will be more resilient, 
when our organizations and 
communities:
•  Know their role in managing 

and mitigating water,  ood,  re, 
disease, air quality risks
•  Engage in training and 

capacity building

•  Collaborate with others to 

make decisions and
Invest resources to take action

Taking the Strategy Forward

Implementing the Strategy Actions

Resilience Champions

Together with the Action Owners of the resilience 
strategy project, the Resilience Unit will develop 
detailed implementation plans and concept notes, 
which assign timelines, responsibilities and resources to 
each of the projects, to ensure they are delivered. These 
are currently in progress.

The Chief Resilience Of cer, with the support of the 
Mayor, established a core advisory group of Resilience 
Champions at the outset of the Strategy Development 
Process. Resilience Champions were nominated across 
multiple departments within MBMB and played a key 
role in the following tasks: 

Melaka’s Resilience Unit has a key role in convening 
government agencies, private organizations and 
community groups to implement actions to make 
Melaka stronger and more resilient. And this work is 
already underway!

The Resilience Unit has received long-standing support 
from Melaka Historic City Council’s leadership. The 
unit has secured funding to kick-start many of the pilot 
and priority projects in this strategy. This funding will 
support: 

•  Community engagement initiatives, to co-design 

and implement resilience projects

•  Securing international expertise, to advice and 
guide the technical implementation of resilience 
actions. 

•  Tactical Urbanism pilot projects, to test 

implementation methods and build stakeholder 
engagement.

The Resilience Unit will meet with the Mayor, on a 
regular bimonthly basis, to monitor the progress of the 
resilience actions, and ensure these projects support 
the vision of the city’s Local Plan.

•  Leveraging networks and resources to support the 
Chief Resilience Of cer and the Resilience Of ce of 
Melaka;

•  Sharing insights on key resilience issues in Melaka 

and providing direction to guide the development of 
initiatives;

•  Assisting in the review and approval of the Resilient 

Melaka strategy documents and actions;

•  Acting as resilience advocates, disseminating 

information on Resilient Melaka across their own 
organizations and in broader spheres of in uence.

Resilience Steering Committee

In order to formalize the important role played by the 
Resilience Champions, an interdisciplinary Resilience 
Steering Committee will be established to oversee 
and guide the implementation of the Resilient Melaka 
Strategy. This will be formed by MBMB staff, Resilience 
Champions and non-city government stakeholders.

This committee will be tasked with:

•  Monitoring progress in the implementation of the 

Resilience Strategy

•  Providing guidance and advice to the Resilience 

Unit in navigating any obstacles or issues.

• 

Identify opportunities for cross-sector 
collaborations

•  Assisting the CRO in developing a robust, actionable 

funding strategy focused on achieving Melaka’s key 
resilience goals

Sharing Melaka’s Experience through City Networks

The Resilience Unit has already played a key role in 
sharing their expertise in developing a city resilience 
strategy with other stakeholders and municipalities across 
Malaysia. 

•  As part of the 2018 WUF9 in Kuala Lumpur, the MBMB 

Resilience Team presented Melaka’s Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment to an international audience.

• 

In 2019, the Resilient Melaka Strategy was presented 
to stakeholders at the Malaysia Urban Forum 

•  The Resilience Unit has established a network of 

contacts including DBKL, Penang, Shah Alam and 
others, to share the Melaka’s experience and progress 
in tackling the city’s complex urbanization,  ooding, 
heritage management and transport challenges.

This work is set to continue as Melaka Historic City 
Council builds expertise as a pioneer in managing a 
resilient modern heritage city.

Learning from Other Cities

As we implement the projects in in this strategy, we will share 
knowledge and experiences with other cities that are pursuing 
similar approaches to urban resilience across the world.

When developing its resilience strategy, 
Pittsburgh in the USA realized that its 
tracts of vacant and underused land 
present a major opportunity to generate 
valuable community assets. Pittsburgh 
is currently implementing a program to 
re-purpose some of this land to provide 
space for recreation, urban agriculture, 
storm-water capture and public areas. 
As we implement Actions 17 + 18 in 
this strategy, we will share knowledge 
and experiences with Pittsburgh, along 
with other cities in the network that are 
pursuing similar approaches.

Mexico City is developing 
methodologies for the inclusion 
of the concept of resilience in 
large infrastructure projects 
such as allocating 10 percent 
of the expenditures budget to 
building resilience.

We want to ensure Melaka’s Resilience 
Strategy remains up to date, relevant and 
effective.  
The Resilience Office will therefore 
review and provide recommendations for 
improving the strategy every 2-3 years, 
in collaboration with key stakeholders 
across MBMB and partner agencies.
  

The strategy review will involve using the City Resilience 
Index (developed by Arup) and SDG and NUA indicators 
to monitor progress. The strategy review could also 
involve  amending the project list, taking into account 
the progress and lessons learnt, and reviewing our 
resilience challenges to ensure they remain relevant. 

Ideally monitoring and evaluation exercises follow a 
systematic process which provides a rigorous evidence-
base to inform decision-making. 

This could include evaluation questions such as: 
•  Relevance - To what extent are the actions 

addressing and mitigating Melaka’s key shocks 
and stresses.

•  E(cid:8) ectiveness - What effects, or impacts have been 

obtained by the Actions?

•  Cost-e(cid:8) ectiveness & e(cid:6)  ciency: How ef ciently have 

the various inputs been converted into outputs and 
results? Were the expected effects obtained at a 
reasonable cost?

•  Sustainability: Will the effects achieved last in the 

medium or long term?

•  Multiple Beneﬁ ts: Do actions also contribute, either 

directly, or indirectly to other goals (social, economic, 
environmental) listed in this strategy? 
This is important for recognizing the synergies 
between actions.

•  Before commencing with a monitoring and evaluation 

study, performance indicators for each action will 
need to be developed. These should be based on 
the evaluation questions above, but could also 
incorporate the Sustainable Development Goal 
indicators, or other city performance metrics.

The diagram below illustrates a proposed monitoring 
and evaluation strategy in  ve steps.

Anything that deliberately 
contributes to the functioning 
or development of the city, 
including a practice, plan, strategy, 
program, project, initiative, study, 
assessment, legislation or provision 
of funding

Institution

A strategic direction that the city 
will pursue to achieve the vision
A tenable and attainable objective

Actor who is responsible for 
carrying out the action. 
Organisations or departments 
with a key role in delivering the 
action. These could be municipal 
departments, private-sector 
stakeholders,  or academic and 
community organisations. 
A working document, used 
in strategy implementation, 
which outlines a timeline of key 
communications and initiative 
targets and deadlines, Project 
Charters and actions for 
institutionalization. 
The physical, economic, social, 
built and natural resources that 
contribute to a city’s resilience.
Comprising four dimensions and 
12 drivers that together illustrate 
what makes a city resilient, the 
CRF is used by cities in the 100RC 
network to help them understand 
the complex and overlapping 
systems that contribute to their 
resilience. Developed by Arup 
with support from the Rockefeller 
Foundation.

Advisor that reports directly to 
the city mayor. Their task is to 
establish a compelling resilience 
vision for his or her city, working 
across departments and with the 
local community to maximize 
innovation and minimize the impact 
of unforeseen events.

An alternative economy in which 
we keep resources in use for 
as long as possible, extract the 
maximum value from them whilst 
in use, then recover and regenerate 
products and materials at the 
end of each service life. This is an 
alternative to a traditional linear 
economy based on make, use, 
dispose principals.

Tactical 
Urbanism

Long term, structural change 
achieved by embedding resilience 
into how a city plans and operates. 
This involves the critical work 
of City Leaders and CROs 
operationalizing the function 
of resilience in their institutions 
in order to adapt and evolve 
city systems to better support 
resilience building. This includes 
making the CRO or Resilience Unit 
permanent, as well as changes 
to city planning and operations 
that will better support resilience 
building.
Design principal ensuring 
mainstream services and products 
are accessible to, and usable by, 
as many people as reasonably 
possible, without the need to be 
adapted or specialized.

A systematic process of tracking 
project implementation, with a 
focus on activities and outputs, 
in order to promote learning and 
course correction, as needed. It 
helps answer the question: Are we 
doing what we set out to do?
A document that establishes an 
initial, qualitative understanding 
of the city’s strengths and 
weaknesses against the City 
Resilience Framework

The capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, 
businesses and systems within a 
city to survive, adapt and thrive 
no matter what kinds of chronic 
stresses or acute shocks they 
encounter.
A tactical roadmap to build 
resilience in the city. The Strategy 
articulates the city’s resilience 
priorities and speci c initiatives 
for short-, medium- and long-term 
implementation.
Multiple cross-cutting resilience 
bene ts of an initiative that result 
from integrated, inclusive and risk-
aware decision making. 
The severity and likelihood of a 
shock or stress occurring

Low-cost, temporary changes to 
the built environment, usually in 
cities, intended to improve local 
neighbourhoods and city gathering 
places. Tactical urbanism is also 
commonly referred to as guerrilla 
urbanism, pop-up urbanism, city 
repair, or D.I.Y. urbanism.

Vision

The level at which the change 
sought by the initiative is meant 
to happen. Example scales 
include household, neighborhood, 
institution, sector, municipality, 
citywide, metropolitan region, 
national, and international.
Social capital is de ned as the 
social networks and interactions 
that inspire trust and reciprocity 
among citizens. Individuals with 
high levels of social capital tend to 
be involved politically, to volunteer 
in their communities, and to get 
together more frequently with 
friends and neighbors (Leyden, 
2003).
A sudden event that threatens a 
city, such as an earthquake,  ood 
or landslide
A chronic (ongoing or cyclical) 
natural or man-made event or 
phenomenon that renders the city 
less able to function and provide 
basic services, particularly for poor 
or vulnerable populations.
Sustainable Drainage Systems are 
a collection of water management 
practices that aim to align modern 
drainage systems with natural 
water processes. SUDS efforts 
make urban drainage systems more 
compatible with components of the 
natural water cycle such as storm 
surge over ows, soil percolation, 
and bio- ltration.
An aspirational description of 
what a city would like to achieve 
or accomplish in the mid-term or 
long-term future. It is intended 
to serves as a clear guide for 
choosing current and future 
courses of action.
