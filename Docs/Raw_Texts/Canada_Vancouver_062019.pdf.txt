RESILIENT VANCOUVER

CONNECT • PREPARE • THRIVE

RESILIENT  
VANCOUVER

From disasters to economic inequity, 
cities around the world are tackling 
the most pressing issues of our time. 
Through holistic initiatives supporting 

prepared neighbourhoods, a collaborative 

government and safe and adaptive 

buildings and infrastructure, this multi-year 

strategy builds our collective capacity to 
prepare for, recover from and thrive in the 

face of changes and challenges.

Unceded Territories of the Musqueam,

A resilient future for the City of 
Vancouver is inextricably linked to 
reconciliation with and among the 
Indigenous Peoples of this land, who 
have been here since time immemorial 
and continue to have thriving, 
living cultures. Thus, the Resilient 
Vancouver strategy starts with the 
acknowledgement that what is now 
known as Vancouver is located on the 
traditional, unceded territories of the 
xʷməθkʷəy̓ əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱ wú7mesh 
(Squamish) and səl̓ ilwətaɁɬ / sel ̓íl ̓witulh 
(Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. 

As Vancouver looks to foster a resilient 
future, we have much to learn from 
Musqueam, Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and 
Urban Indigenous people who, despite 
systematic and institutional efforts to 
eradicate their communities and their 

cultures, have survived and represent a 
growing and powerful force — revitalizing 
their languages and cultures, reclaiming 
and naming traditional cultural spaces 
and fighting to shape new relationships 
among all peoples of this land.

Acknowledging and building a shared 
understanding of the experience 
and strength of Indigenous People in 
Vancouver and across Canada is a critical 
step in envisioning a resilient future in 
which there is space for all to thrive. 
As a City of Reconciliation, Vancouver 
City Council has committed to “form a 
sustained relationship of mutual respect 
and understanding with local First Nations 
and the Urban Indigenous community”. 
This is an ongoing and evolving 
commitment, and one that is foundational 
to a successful resilience strategy.

and have committed to implementation, 
and for the support and partnership with 
100 Resilient Cities and partners around 
the world. 

It is my honour to launch the Resilient 
Vancouver strategy, and to invite you 
to continue working with us to ensure 
Vancouver remains strong, vibrant and 
resilient — a city that works for everyone.

With gratitude, 

Kennedy Stewart 
Mayor of Vancouver

Letter from the Mayor 

Vancouver is a hub of 
diversity and culture, 
and a city of stunning 
natural beauty that 
inspires economic 
innovation and social 
movements. We are 
among the most 
liveable cities in the 

world, and yet, we are also a city at risk. 
From disasters to disparity, Vancouverites 
are on the frontlines of many of the world’s 
most pressing resilience challenges. 
Through our Resilient Vancouver strategy, 
and by building on the strength and 
knowledge of our community, we are 
preparing to face them head on. 

Here on the traditional and unceded 
territory of the Musqueam, Squamish 
and Tsleil-Waututh Nations, resilience 
is not new. It is a concept that has 
been embedded in the laws and 
culture of the Indigenous Peoples that 
have been stewards of this land since 
time immemorial. 

Knowledge of many of our city’s greatest 
shocks — including earthquakes and floods 
— has been shared for generations through 
Indigenous oral histories. Others, like a lack 
of affordability and growing social inequity, 
are a product of unjust colonial systems 
that have excluded people based on the 
colour of their skin, their cultural heritage 
and their gender.

|  R Es Il I E N T VA N CO U V E R

In Vancouver we have the responsibility, 
the capacity and the collective 
knowledge to address these challenges. 
We are already taking bold action. We 
are committed to Reconciliation with 
Indigenous Peoples, and are working 
hard to make space for women and 
underrepresented groups at decision-
making tables. We are finding new 
ways to deliver low- and middle-income 
housing and we are leading the way in 
climate change mitigation and adaptation. 

Resilient Vancouver builds on this 
strong foundation and amplifies work 
underway across our community. The 
strategy draws on the deep knowledge 
of our residents to empower individuals, 
businesses and organizations to prepare 
for disasters and to do their part to take 
care of each other when times are tough. 
Resilient Vancouver serves as a building 
block for our forthcoming City-wide 
Plan, supporting integrated and holistic 
planning for an era of uncertainty, so that 
future generations can survive, adapt and 
thrive no matter what shocks and stresses 
they face. 

This strategy has been a collective effort, 
strengthened by the expertise and 
diversity of voices that have contributed. 
I am grateful to the thousands of 
Vancouverites, stakeholders and 
partners who participated in this process 

We look forward to watching this work 
continue, creating a better city for all 
Vancouverites.

Sincerely,

Michael Berkowitz 
President, 100 Resilient Cities

Letter from 100 Resilient Cities

On behalf of 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered 
by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC), 
congratulations to Mayor Kennedy Stewart, 
Chief Resilience Officer Katie McPherson, 
and the City of Vancouver on the release of 
Resilient Vancouver. 

With the city’s first Resilience strategy, 
Vancouver has taken the critical step of 
recognizing its assets and areas of strength, 
while simultaneously acknowledging its 
challenges and identifying ways to leverage 
strengths to fill those gaps. This work is 
the product of broad engagement with a 
multitude of local residents, community 
leaders, and other stakeholders from across 
a variety of sectors, and represents a 
blueprint for preparing for a more resilient 
future at the regional, city, neighborhood, 
and personal level.

since Vancouver joined the 100RC 
Network in 2016, we have worked in 
partnership to create a Strategy firmly 
grounded in the city’s vibrant diversity 
and history as a leader in areas such 
as sustainability. The work addresses 
the specific shocks and stresses facing 
Vancouver, such as earthquakes, 
affordability, and climate change, merging 
these social, physical, and environmental 
challenges into a comprehensive approach 
to the future. The roadmap presented 
by Resilient Vancouver sets the city up 
for future success, not least because the 

process of engaging Vancouverites of 
all backgrounds in innovative ways has 
already laid the groundwork to prepare 
them in the face of both known and 
unknown challenges ahead. In this way, 
Vancouver will continue to serve as an 
inspiration to other cities looking to build 
resilience worldwide.

We at 100RC are especially excited 
to see the unique framing of Resilient 
Vancouver implemented through 
concrete actions like the Resilient 
Neighbourhoods Program and the 
holistic Resilient Buildings model. 
These actions are just a few of the 
many that Vancouver has set to 
create a city focused every day on the 
principles of reconciliation, equity and 
intersectionality, sustainability, recovery, 
and reciprocity.

While the release of Vancouver’s 
Resilience strategy marks a critical 
milestone in the city’s resilience journey, 
we recognize that the work is far from 
over. The implementation of the actions 
outlined in the pages that follow are 
the real work required to support 
thriving and prepared neighborhoods, 
build a proactive and collaborative 
government, and ensure that buildings 
and infrastructure are safe and adaptive 
today and into the future, regardless 
of what challenges that future brings.

Vancouver

Situated on the Salish Sea, and within the 
unceded homelands of the Musqueam, 
Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh Nations, 
Vancouver is a young and growing city in 
a land rich in cultural heritage. The City 
of Vancouver is 1 of 21 municipalities, one 
Treaty First Nation and one Electoral 
Area that make up Metro Vancouver. Our 
residents and businesses contribute and 
benefit from many regionally coordinated 
services and infrastructure. Recognized 
around the world as a progressive city 
committed to social, environmental 
and economic sustainability, Vancouver 
is home to an expanding and diverse 
population, unparalleled natural beauty, 
a vibrant creative sector and Canada’s 
fastest growing economy. 

And yet, amidst these strengths 
and assets, Vancouver faces 

1 0 

|  R Es Il I E N T VA N CO U V E R

many complex and interconnected 
challenges that impact the resilience 
of our residents, neighbourhoods, 
businesses and urban systems.

Our sustainable future is threatened by 
catastrophic earthquakes and sea level rise. 
In recent years, wildfire smoke and extreme 
weather have become our “new normal” 
and continue to disproportionately impact 
people that experience social isolation, 
chronic health issues, poverty and other 
barriers. Social and economic inequities, 
unaffordable housing and cycles of mental 
health and addiction crises undermine the 
well-being of all our residents, and the 
capacity of the City and local organizations 
to plan proactively and recover from 
disruptions and shocks. Transformative 
policies, partnerships and investments are 
required so that our social and physical 
infrastructure can continue to serve our 
community in a rapidly changing future.

Vancouver is not alone. The 2019 Global 
Risk Report1 identifies natural disasters, 
extreme weather and the failure of 
climate mitigation as among the most 
significant threats to global stability. In 
addition, declining trust in government, 
increasing political polarization, declining 
mental health and economic and social 
inequities are identified as critical factors 
undermining humankind’s ability to survive, 
adapt and thrive. With 70 per cent of the 
world’s population expected to live in 

urban areas by 2050, cities are on the front 
lines of these trends and challenges; cities 
will also be the source of many solutions.

Fostering resilience and finding local 
solutions to these shocks and stresses 
demands collaboration and creativity. It 
requires us to take a holistic and inclusive 
approach to understanding the drivers 
of risk in our community and anticipating 
future trends. 

The Resilient Vancouver strategy is 
aimed at enhancing the capacity of our 
neighbourhoods, our government and 
our buildings and infrastructure to serve 
our diverse communities today, to reduce 
chronic stresses, and to withstand and 
recover from inevitable shocks. Our strategy 
acknowledges that our challenges will 
evolve over time, and that we must be 
forward thinking and adaptive to thrive in an 
era of rapid change.

Supported by strong partnerships 
and cross-departmental collaboration, 
Vancouver is well-positioned to rise to this 
challenge and embed resilience into the 
fabric of our city. Through a collaborative 
and human-centred approach, and by 
leveraging the creativity and experience 
of our community and our partners, we 
can invest in the health, well-being and 
affordability of our community today, while 
actively reducing risk for future generations.

Working with 100 Resilient Cities

In 2016 the City of Vancouver was awarded 
membership in the 100 Resilient Cities 
Network (100RC), an initiative pioneered 
by the Rockefeller Foundation. Through this 
partnership, Vancouver joined a cohort of 100 
cities around the globe committed to working 
together to become more resilient to the 
physical, social and economic challenges of the 
21st century.

100 Resilient Cities defines urban resilience 
as “The capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within 
a city to survive, adapt, and grow, no matter 
what kinds of chronic stresses and acute 
shocks they experience.” 

Shocks are sudden-onset events, such as 
earthquakes, floods and extreme weather. 
Stresses are conditions that weaken the urban 
fabric of a city on a daily or reoccurring basis, such 
as racism, social isolation and poverty.

In Vancouver, a local commitment to reconciliation 
and community health, a growing green economy 
and climate mitigation and adaptation efforts all 
contribute to urban resilience. Our partnership 
with 100 Resilient Cities has supported the 
City of Vancouver in building upon this strong 
foundation, learning from and sharing with other 
global cities and, most importantly, convening and 
collaborating with local partners and stakeholders. 

In 2017, Chief Resilience Officers from around the globe convened at the 100 Resilient Cities Summit in New York.

A Strong Foundation

Resilient Vancouver is not a standalone strategy — it has emerged from a history of strategic initiatives that have advanced social, 
environmental and economic sustainability and resilience, and it supports and will be embedded through a number of forthcoming 
initiatives. Resilient Vancouver knits together and celebrates the vital foundations of resilience articulated through these strategies, 
and addresses critical gaps required to sustain our community in a rapidly changing future. The highlighted strategies represent 
recent and forthcoming policy that contributes to an equitable, sustainable and resilient future.

Existing strategies
Reconciliation Framework

Established in 2014, the City of Vancouver 
adopted a Reconciliation Framework that 
works towards three long-term goals: 
strengthening local First Nations and Urban 
Indigenous relations; promoting Indigenous 
arts, culture, awareness and understanding; 
and incorporating First Nations and Urban 
Indigenous perspectives for more effective 
City services. Reconciliation is an ongoing 
process that continues to evolve and informs 
all civic work. 

Earthquake Preparedness Strategy

In 2013, Vancouver developed an Earthquake 
Preparedness strategy to prepare for and 
respond to earthquakes in Vancouver. This 
was the City’s first major strategy to address 
this hazard and identified 56 actions across 
three categories: volunteers and community, 
critical services and buildings. A key need 
identified through this work was support for 
developing a comprehensive assessment of 
seismic risk in Vancouver. 

Transportation 2040

Transportation 2040 is a long-term strategic 
plan for the city that will help guide resilient 
transportation and land use decisions and 
public investments for the years ahead. It 
supports travel modes that use renewable 

14 

|  R Es Il I E N T VA N CO U V E R

fuels and that move more people with less 
pollution—like electric cars, transit, and active 
transportation modes such as walking and 
cycling. This includes supporting low-impact 
local goods movement and delivery services.

Housing Vancouver

launched in 2017, Housing Vancouver is the 
City’s 10-year strategy to reduce Vancouver’s 
housing affordability gap and to provide 
a strong foundation for the city’s future. 
Ambitious targets include creating 72,000 
new homes in Vancouver in the next 10 years, 
half of which will serve households making less 
than $80,000. Together with the Vancouver 
Affordable Housing Fund, this plan will drive 
many changes across the city to ensure that 
our diverse communities can continue to grow.

Climate Adaptation Strategy

Created in 2012 and updated in 2018, 
the Climate Adaptation strategy is 
Vancouver’s Climate Resilience framework 
and complements the Resilient Vancouver 
strategy. The Climate Adaptation strategy 
includes five goal areas with priority and 
supporting actions aimed at minimizing 
climate change impacts and enhancing 
Vancouver’s capacity to withstand impacts 
from rising temperatures, more intense and 
frequent rainfall and sea level rise. 

Healthy City Strategy

launched in 2014, the Healthy City strategy 
articulates the City of Vancouver’s commitment 
to social sustainability and equity, and is the 
foundation for the City’s strategic efforts to build 
the conditions in which people can live, thrive 
and prosper. The Strategy is comprised of 13 
long-term goals and ambitious targets for 2025. 
Targets aim to advance population health and 
well-being and promote inclusion, connection, 
equity and resilience, while integrating economic 
and environmental sustainability into social 
policy. It focuses on three core domains: healthy 
people, healthy communities and healthy 
environments.

Greenest City 2020 

The Greenest City Action Plan (GCAP) is the 
overarching environmental sustainability 
framework for the City of Vancouver. This 
globally recognized environmental policy 
articulates a vision, targets, key actions and 
indicators for monitoring how Vancouver’s 
environmental performance changes over 
time. It was first adopted in 2011 with targets to 
2020. In 2019, Council directed staff to develop 
the next iteration of this strategy, integrating 
lessons from the past and addressing emerging 
environmental issues. 

Supporting a Resilient Future

Resilient Vancouver will succeed to the extent that it supports 
and evolves with interconnected strategies. Our City is moving 
several important initiatives forward that seek to foster a 
more equitable, sustainable and resilient future. Each of these 
initiatives embed and advance resilience.

Forthcoming Strategies

City-wide Plan

In 2018, Council directed staff to develop a scope for the first City-
wide Plan in decades. As of June 2019, the scoping process is 
underway. A City-wide Plan will provide an opportunity to integrate 
resilience directly into urban planning and to host a collaborative 
process in setting long-term resilience and risk reduction targets.

Creative City Strategy

The Creative City Strategy will provide a comprehensive new 
framework and vision for art, culture and creativity, which will reflect 
the City’s commitment to reconciliation and equity, include previously 
underrepresented voices and communities, build partnerships across 
communities and work to strengthen arts and culture.

Equity Framework 

Vancouver is developing a framework to address our most critical 
social stress – deeply embedded and growing inequity. The 
forthcoming Equity Framework has roots in social sustainability 
and the Healthy City strategy, and is being informed and developed 
through careful consultation with equity-seeking groups. This work 
seeks to more strongly align internal organizational processes and 
practices to promote accelerated social sustainability, inclusion and 
diversity across all department work at the City for the benefit of all.

Rain City Strategy 

Recognizing growing pressure on our natural and built water 
systems, Vancouver is creating a Rain City strategy to ensure the 
long-term resilience and sustainability of water resources, and the 
health of our residents and environment through the integration of 
green infrastructure.

Community Perspectives on Resilience

Resilience means different things to 
different people. In our consultations 
with over 2,500 stakeholders, many 
people spoke about disasters and the 
failure of physical infrastructure as being 
key threats to resilience that we need to 
understand and manage. We also heard 
that when it comes to withstanding and 
recovering from shocks, it is human 
capacity, neighbourhood connections 
and lived experience that matter most. 
Throughout our process we continuously 
heard about incredible social and 
physical assets as well as local knowledge 

and strengths that contribute to day-to-
day resilience, which we must learn from 
and amplify to foster a resilient future. 

Most importantly, here on the 
unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓ əm 
(Musqueam), Sḵwx̱ wú7mesh (Squamish) 
and səl̓ ilwətaɁɬ / sel̓ íl̓ witulh (Tsleil-
Waututh), we have much to gain and 
learn by recognizing and elevating the 
knowledge of Indigenous Peoples, who 
have been here for millennia and have 
long embodied resilience and reciprocity 
through law and culture. Indigenous 
Peoples continue to demonstrate 

incredible resilience through their work 
to revitalize their languages and cultures, 
reclaim and name their spaces and in 
fighting to shape a new relationship 
between all people within this land. 

The City of Vancouver hosted many 
dialogues where we asked the 
community about Vancouver’s greatest 
strengths, about the meaning of 
resilience and about local examples. The 
responses were diverse and thoughtful, 
and reflected the deep knowledge and 
experience that already exist in our 
community.

Stories of Resilience

From cultural redress to 
emergency response, our 
community shared many 
examples of resilience. 
Documenting and learning from 
these experiences is an important 
part of shaping a resilient future. 

The Great Vancouver  
Fire of 1886

On June 13, 1886, the Great 
Vancouver Fire destroyed all but 
3 of the city’s 1,000 buildings  
and killed dozens of people 
in only 30 minutes. To escape 
the flames, people jumped into 
the Burrard Inlet and would 
have perished if they had not 
been rescued by Sḵwx̱ wú7mesh 
(Squamish) Nation paddlers. 
Paddlers, mostly women, set 
out across the inlet in dozens 
of canoes and rescued people 
fleeing the burning city. The 
rescuers paddled back and forth 
through the night bring them 
back to the safety of the north 
shore and generously cared for 
them as they recovered.

Nora Hendrix Place  
and Hogan’s Alley, 2019 

Bulldozed in 1971 to make 
way for the Georgia Viaduct, 
Hogan’s Alley was once 
the heart of a vibrant Black 
community in Vancouver. 
Today, the viaduct is slated 
to be removed, and key 
blocks of this once thriving 
community are being 
designed as a way to revive 
the neighbourhood and 
address this loss. Members 
of the Hogan’s Alley society 
are working tirelessly to 
illuminate the history of this 
neighbourhood, to centre 
Black voices in the planning 
process, and to revitalize and 
reclaim Black cultural spaces 
in the neighbourhood. In 
2019 the City of Vancouver 
and the Province of B.C. 
opened a temporary 
modular housing project in 
Strathcona named after Nora 
Hendrix, a community leader 
who helped start the first 
Black church in Vancouver 

This life-saving intervention 
saw over 2,000 visits across 
several locations. The 
Warming Centres have since 
continued to operate every 
winter since.

Gathering of Canoes,  
July 2017

and was a cook at Vie’s 
Chicken and steak House in 
Hogan’s Alley. Nora Hendrix 
Place is a 52 unit building 
that is meant to reflect and 
advance the long term vision 
of this site to be developed 
by the Black community, as 
outlined in the Northeast 
False Creek Plan.

Opening of Warming 
Centres, December 2016

In July 2017, more than 2,500 
people gathered to watch 
a flotilla of 25 canoes and 
350 canoe pullers paddle 
along Vancouver’s coastline. 
The Gathering of Canoes 
was the final stop on a 10-
day Pulling Together Canoe 
Journey down the B.C. 
coast, an act of solidarity 
and cooperation toward 
reconciliation between 
Indigenous communities and 
non-Indigenous Canadians.

At the Hadden Park shore 
near the Vancouver Maritime 
Museum, Elders and Chiefs 
from the Host Nations 
welcomed canoes to their 
shared traditional territory 
using traditional protocol.

In December 2016 Vancouver 
experienced an unusually 
long cold snap, with 
temperatures falling below 
freezing over several days, 
and several inches of snow 
accumulating. Shelters across 
the region were filled with 
people who were homeless 
trying to find respite from 
the icy conditions. The 
Vancouver Park Board and 
the City partnered to keep 
several community centres 
open overnight as low-barrier 
Warming Centres to augment 
shelter capacity and support 
for those most vulnerable.

Creating our Strategy

Our Approach 

From the beginning, the City of 
Vancouver set out to develop a resilience 
strategy through a process that would:

 Ì Address critical gaps and 
avoid duplication by dedicating 
resources and convening partners 
around issues and threats not 
already being addressed, or where 
new efforts are required;

 Ì Amplify existing efforts by 
highlighting and celebrating work 
undertaken across our community;

 Ì Leverage partnerships through 
reciprocal collaboration with other 
levels of governments and civic and 
community partners working towards 
resilience goals; and

 Ì Embed resilience by developing 
support tools and processes 
for City departments and 
community organizations.

Resilient Vancouver was developed 
through a multi-phase process supported 
by local and global partners, and in 
collaboration with all City departments. 
Phase 1 culminated with a Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment. In Phase 2, we 
initiated high-priority work with partners 
and produced this strategy. Moving 
forward, we will set targets for objectives 
and implement actions through 
integration with related city initiatives 
and in collaboration with partners. 

Live music was part of the 2018 CityStudio Bridge Warming, a youth-led event 
to build community resilience through social connection and place-making in 
underutilized spaces.

A Strategy Built on Partnerships

In addition to consultation with thousands of stakeholders, a cornerstone of the strategy development process has been strong, 
reciprocal partnerships, which will be fundamental to successful implementation. From hyper-local to global, this strategy would 
not have been possible without constant collaboration, including with key partners listed below.

Institutional and  
Academic Partners

Community  
Organizations

Pathways to Disaster Risk 
Reduction Collaborative

Seismic Policy  
Advisory Committee

The Vancouver City 
Planning Commission, 
Vancouver Economic 
Commission, Simon Fraser 
University (SFU) and 
the University of British 
Columbia (UBC) supported 
the City’s Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment 
process by hosting 
workshops, contributing 
to research and offering 
expertise and insight 
throughout the process. In 
addition, students from SFU, 
UBC, the Global Network 
for Advanced Management, 
Emily Carr University of Art 
+ Design, langara College 
and CityStudio have made 
significant contributions to 
resilience projects. 

Resilient Neighbourhoods 
partners and collaborators, 
including Britannia 
Community Services Centre, 
Dunbar Community Centre 
Association, Collingwood 
Neighbourhood House, 
312 Main, Our Place, 
and Neighbour lab, 
were central to enabling 
outreach to residents, 
community organizations, 
and underrepresented 
voices within their 
neighbourhoods. The 
partnerships and networks 
established by these 
groups extend deep into 
the community and reach 
across other cities. 

Spearheaded by Natural 
Resources Canada, the 
PDRR Collaborative includes 
10 steering committee 
members and many other 
contributing organizations 
(including regional, provincial 
and federal government 
partners, global organizations 
and academic institutions.) 
The initiative brings subject 
matter experts together 
with end-users to enhance 
information and tools to 
advance risk reduction in 
the Vancouver region. This 
project is central to future 
work to model and evaluate 
options for social, economic 
and hazard resilience, and 
provides the data and 
modelling required to inform 
robust community dialogue 
on resilience priorities and 
targets moving forward

Inclusive of all levels of 
government and academia, 
and including numerous 
local engineers, the 
seismic Policy Advisory 
Committee has brought 
together world-leading 
experts to generously 
commit their time, expertise 
and research to support a 
leading-edge assessment of 
earthquake risk to buildings 
in Vancouver, and set the 
foundation for effective risk 
reduction policy.

STReSSeS ANd ShoCkS

Residents of Vancouver live with risk 
every day. Our resilience is influenced 
by physical geography and the natural 
environment, our urban infrastructure 
and buildings and social, political and 
economic systems. 

Many of the same qualities and assets 
that make Vancouver among the most 
desirable places in the world to live also 
pose unique challenges for resilience. 
The stunning mountains and shoreline 
that surround us support incredible 
biodiversity and enhance our quality 
of life, but they also remind us of our 

exposure to earthquakes and flooding. 
Our port and position as the Pacific 
Gateway create thousands of jobs and 
economic growth, and yet expose us 
to oil spills and hazardous materials 
incidents that threaten our natural 
environment and health. 

As our city grows and is influenced by 
global trends, the shocks and stresses 
we face will continue to evolve. While 
this strategy addresses many current 
challenges, resilience is not static. 
Vancouver must continue to be vigilant 
and forward thinking to identify and 
manage emerging challenges.

Shocks are sudden-onset events, 
such as earthquakes, floods and

Stresses are conditions that weaken 
the urban fabric of a city on a daily 
or reoccurring basis, such as racism, 
social isolation and poverty.

R E s I l I E N T VA N CO U V E R

Stresses  
Social and Economic Stresses

Social and economic stresses result in inequities that undermine groups and individuals’ ability to manage and benefit from 
change, and to withstand and recover from shocks. In Vancouver, we see this in the way that our growing economy excludes 
many from the Indigenous and Black communities and people of colour, and in the way that snowstorms and power outages 
are inconvenient for some, but life threatening for others. Similarly, many trends we face, such as an aging population, are not 
inherently negative, but they represent changes that need to be considered.

Understanding the social and economic stresses and trends that impact our community on a daily basis is critical to creating 
solutions that will build real resilience for our residents and our systems, regardless of if and when disaster strikes. 

“Affordable housing is 
our number one priority 
— everyone in Vancouver 
should have somewhere 
safe and secure they can 
call home. Innovative 
housing solutions are 
crucial in providing homes 
that are accessible to 
all people to ensure our 
residents can stay living and 
working in the city”. 
– Mayor Kennedy Stewart

Affordability

Debt and Low Wages

Vancouver is one of the least affordable 
cities in North America; unaffordable 
commercial and residential properties, 
coupled with low average incomes and 
rising costs of food and services, fuel 
the affordability crisis. Employers find it 
challenging to attract and retain talent, 
while young families are moving away from 
the city. 

Aging Population

Projections indicate a 92 per cent increase 
in the number of people aged 65 and older 
by 2041, and a 10 per cent increase in 
people aged 0–64. While many seniors are 
living longer, healthier lives, the number of 
seniors experiencing poverty and housing 
insecurity is rising, putting new demands 
on social and government services. 

Vancouverites carry more debt than 
anywhere else in Canada, and are 
vulnerable to even small economic 
changes2. In 2015, Vancouver’s median 
income was $65,327, compared to a 
Canadian median income of $70,336. 
There is a $7,000 difference in median 
salary between men and women.

Food Insecurity

In Vancouver 10 per cent of households 
experience food insecurity, with single 
mothers having the highest rates of any 
household type at 34 per cent (five times 
higher than couples with no children)3. 
Food insecurity has life-long impacts on 
the health and well-being of individuals 
and communities. Food security is also 
threatened by a decline in culturally 
appropriate foods: between 2009 and 
2016, 56 per cent of food service retailers 
in Chinatown closed.

Resilience in Action:  
Temporary Modular Housing

Vancouver is experiencing a housing 
affordability and homelessness 
crisis. In addition to long-term 
planning, the City of Vancouver is 
constructing temporary modular 
housing to provide immediate relief 
for hundreds of people living without 
a home. Since 2017, 600 units have 
been opened, and more are planned. 
Residents of temporary modular 
housing are offered support, such as 
life skills training as well as health and 
social services. They are provided 
two meals a day and opportunities to 
engage through community groups, 
volunteer work and social events. 
Safe housing provides a platform 
for people to build healthy lives, and 
also reduces exposure to shocks, like 
extreme weather.

Homelessness

Poverty

The 2018 homeless count identified 
2,181 homeless people in Vancouver. 
Indigenous people are vastly 
overrepresented in these numbers. In 
2018 and 2019, modular housing has been 
constructed as a temporary response 
to this crisis. In the event of a major 
earthquake, more than 150,000 people 
would be immediately homeless.

Gender Inequity 

The City’s Women’s Equity Strategy 
found that only 57 per cent of women 
feel safe walking in their neighbourhoods 
after dark compared to 75 per cent 
of men, and 80 per cent of reported 
intimate partner violence is against 
women. There is an 11.8 per cent 
employment gap between women and 
men. For Indigenous and Black women, 
women of colour, and lGBTQ2+ people, 
these statistics are more acute. 

More than one in five children in Metro 
Vancouver live in poverty, including 
more than 40 per cent of children in 
single-parent homes4. Nearly half of 
residents in Vancouver do not earn 
a living wage, while 70 per cent of 
people in the Downtown Eastside are 
considered low income.

Racism

A 2017 survey found that 82 per cent of 
people identifying as visible minorities 
experienced racism, and 33 per cent 
said they have been a target of abuse5. 
Racial inequity has been deeply 
embedded in Vancouver through policy 
for generations, and through hate and 
fear, a rise in racist sentiment in Canada 
is undermining resilience efforts. Almost 
half of Vancouverites were born outside 
Canada, and 2.2 per cent of residents 
(14,000) identify as Indigenous. 

Lack of Diversity in Decision-Making

Social Isolation

The underrepresentation of people 
with disabilities and of those who are 
non-white or gender diverse in civic 
leadership roles and engagement 
activities reflect embedded institutional 
barriers. During consultations, the 
community shared that inequity and 
exclusion of diverse voices reinforces 
these barriers throughout the decision-
making and planning processes.

A recent survey found that 50 per cent 
of Vancouverites are unable to identify 
four people they could confide in, and 
only 54 per cent reported a strong sense 
of community6. Almost 40 per cent of 
households in Vancouver consist of a 
single person. In a disaster, social isolation 
creates barriers to neighbours caring for 
one another.

Resilience in Action:  
Developing an Equity Framework 

In Vancouver, continued efforts to 
create a more equitable and just society 
not only improve the day-to-day lives 
of our residents, they are essential for 
building the capacities of individuals, 
cities, organizations and governments to 
manage and recover from shocks. 

Informed by the Healthy City strategy, 
Vancouver is developing an Equity 
Framework to address the systemic 
causes of many social and economic 
stresses. This includes tools and 
guidance for applying an intersectional 
approach to city planning and policy. 
Intersectionality is a way of seeing how 
a group of people or social problem 
is affected by mutually reinforcing 
systems that work together to create 
inequity and social exclusion. 

From a resilience perspective, this 
means understanding the way that 
differences in gender, age, race, 
culture, class, language and ability 
combine and intersect with social and 
institutional systems to influence a 
person’s lived experience and, in turn, 
the way they experience and recover 
from shocks.

“ To the extent that we are 
progressive and resilient today, it 
is because of people that stood 
up and fought for what is right”. 
– Community voice

It’s important to acknowledge that 
inequity and vulnerability to shocks 
and stresses does not indicate a lack 
of personal resilience. People that 
experience inequities demonstrate 
exceptional personal resilience 
every day, and have fought hard for 
many of the progressive values we 
claim today. By learning from these 
experiences and by resourcing and 
prioritizing community solutions, we 
can not only reduce risk, but foster 
better outcomes for all communities 
and people. 

R E s I l I E N T VA N CO U V E R

Environmental and Infrastructure Stresses

In addition to social and economic stresses and trends, Vancouver is vulnerable to several 
interrelated environmental and infrastructure pressures. Our infrastructure is aging at a 
time when our population is growing, and our environment is rapidly changing. We need to 
look at new and creative solutions to ensure that the services provided by our infrastructure 
and environment can continue to serve increased demand from our community under 
changing conditions. 

Increasing Demand  
and Aging Civic Facilities

Many of Vancouver’s civic facilities, 
including firehalls, police buildings, 
community centres, libraries and 
service yards, were constructed before 
the introduction of strict seismic and 
energy standards. As our population 
grows and climate changes, our facilities 
will fall under increasing pressure to 
provide more services. Continued and 
accelerated investment in resilient civic 
facilities is an important component 
of community well-being, emergency 
response and risk reduction, especially in 
high-risk neighbourhoods.

Aging Buildings

There are more than 90,000 buildings in 
Vancouver. Vancouver sets high standards 
for new buildings, but has limited tools to 
improve older buildings, many of which 
are at high risk from earthquakes and were 
not constructed for a hotter climate and 
contribute to unsafe and unstable conditions 
for occupants. less than 50 per cent of 
residents have insurance for earthquakes, 

and most renters do not have any 
insurance at all. The cost of renovations 
and the threat of “renoviction” are 
barriers to upgrades and safety that 
must be overcome.

Water System and Resources

By 2050, a 58 per cent decline in snow 
pack will impact Vancouver’s drinking 
water reservoirs, while more intense 
rainstorms will increase risk of flooding. 
Currently 27 per cent of water system 
infrastructure is in poor or very poor 
condition. The City regularly upgrades 
water pipes to higher seismic standards 
during repair and road work, but this 
does not guarantee the resilience of 
water systems on private property.

Climate Change

Canada is warming at a rate faster 
than the rest of the world7. A changing 
climate is driving declining biodiversity, 
threats to human health and global 
conflict and migration; it is also driving 
new and transformative policy and 
technology — all of which will influence 
Vancouver’s resilient future. 

3 4 

|  R Es Il I E N T VA N CO U V E R

Resilience in Action:  
Doing Our Part to Prevent  
Climate Breakdown 

In 2019, Vancouver City Council directed 
staff to develop new targets to confront the 
climate emergency, and join cities around 
the world committed to doing their part to 
limit global warming to 1.5 C. The result is 
an ambitious plan that will transform the 
urban design of our city and regenerate 
natural ecosystems. By integrating equity 
and resilience into this work, Vancouver is 
in a position to help lead that change in way 
that benefits all people.

R E s I l I E N T VA N CO U V E R 

|  3 5

Food System Resilience 

A 2009 report identified that 
Vancouver’s supply of produce would 
last 72 hours at any given time8. Many 
Indigenous and local food sources have 
declined through development, pollution 
and invasive species, and are under 
continued pressure from climate change. 
Shocks like earthquakes threaten access 
to food resources. Many food suppliers, 
community kitchens, businesses and 
non-profits lack business continuity and 
emergency plans. 

Regional Infrastructure  
and Supply Chains

Regionally, many highways, rail lines, 
pipelines and digital networks that serve 
Vancouver have been constructed in 
flood plains and seismic zones. They are 
vulnerable to extreme weather, landslides, 
avalanches and accidents. Disruptions to 
supply chains limit access to food, water, 
energy and supplies for Vancouverites, 
and have significant impacts on the 
national economy. Eighty per cent of 
municipally owned infrastructure in our 
region is not insured. 

Resilience in Action: Working 
with Partners to Keep 
Transportation Networks Open

The City of Vancouver’s transportation 
network includes more than 40 
bridges. While priority bridges are 
being upgraded, inspecting all bridges 
post-disaster is important to enable 
the safe flow of people and emergency 
supplies post-disaster. To accelerate 
this process, Vancouver’s Engineering 
Department has worked in partnership 
with local engineering firms to develop 
leading-edge processes to deploy and 
inspect priority bridges in the aftermath 
of an earthquake. Priority bridges 
have been documented, including the 
development of a unique assessment 
process for non-technical staff to 
facilitate expedited visual assessment 
to determine if a bridge should remain 
open or be closed.

Shocks

Vancouver experiences a range of shocks and hazards every year, and we have strong 
emergency plans in place capable of managing the majority of these cases without 
outside support. However, as the frequency of events increases, and as the growth of 
our city means more people are exposed, we must build risk reduction and resilience 
into future planning. 

Climate and Geo-Physical shocks

Earthquakes

Coastal and Riverine Flooding

Vancouver is at risk from multiple types 
of earthquakes. Hundreds of small 
earthquakes occur in our region every 
year, and while most are not felt, a major 
earthquake is inevitable in our future. 

Forest Fires / Air Quality

2017 and 2018 were the worst fire seasons 
recorded in B.C. In 2017 alone, 1.2 million 
hectares of land burned, over $568 
million was spent on fire suppression and 
over 65,000 British Columbians were 
displaced, with many evacuees coming 
to Vancouver for support and shelter9. In 
the future the number of climate refugees 
will increase and air quality will worsen for 
Vancouverites as a result of regional fires, 
and the risk of more localized forest fires 
will increase. 

The Greater Vancouver region is at 
significant risk of flooding from the 
Fraser River and from coastal storm 
surge events that threaten important 
regional infrastructure and supply 
chains. It has been estimated that 
worst-case coastal flooding today will 
cost $19 billion, with riverine flooding 
costing $22 billion. Without active risk 
reduction measures, these are projected 
to increase to $24 and $32 billion 
respectively by 2100.10

Extreme Weather and Temperatures

By 2050, hot days will be 4 C hotter 
and heat waves more frequent; rainfall 
event intensity will increase 33–63 per 
cent. Extreme heat and cold are already 
impacting Vancouverites.

3 8 

|  R Es Il I E N T VA N CO U V E R

Technological and Health shocks
Oil Spills

An increase in shipping also increases 
the likelihood of marine and pipeline oil 
spills. A worst-case marine oil spill and 
the resulting clean-up operations may 
cost the local economy over $1 billion, 
and could expose a significant number 
of people to toxic fumes. A 2014 study 
indicated that Vancouver’s $41 billion 
brand value could experiences losses of 
$4 billion due to a major oil spill.11 

The Cost of Disasters 

Compared to other Canadian 
cities, Vancouver’s hazard profile 
contributes to heightened exposure 
to shocks with significant long-term 
impacts. For example, our region 
is vulnerable to both catastrophic 
earthquakes and floods, and while 
these events do not occur frequently, 
the magnitude of impact dwarfs 
that of other major Canadian 
hazards. Exposed local and regional 
infrastructure is a key driver of 
risk and potential economic loss. 
The table to the right compares 
these potential disasters with other 
significant disasters experienced 
elsewhere in Canada. 

Public Health Emergencies  
— Opioid Crisis

The ongoing opioid emergency is one 
example of a public health emergency. 
A poisoned opioid supply has resulted 
in thousands of lives lost and millions of 
dollars re-directed towards response. 
Exacerbated by stigma, a shock occurs 
every time a new poisoned supply is 
released in Vancouver. 

Infrastructure Failure and Disruption

Infrastructure failures and disruptions 
have broad consequences for 
interdependent systems. Cyber-attacks, 
gas-line failures, power outages, and 
transit shut-downs pose unique and 
complex risks to our economy, people 
and critical systems.

Hazardous Materials

Hazardous materials move regularly 
through Vancouver via road, river, sea 
and rail and are concentrated around 
ports and industrial lands. Hazardous 
materials incidents contaminate the 
soil, air and water, threatening human 
and ecological health. For example, in 
2015 a container fire spread toxic smoke 
across parts of East Vancouver for 2 days 
before being extinguished. 

Residential Fires

Vancouver Fire and Rescue services 
responds to hundreds of fires annually. 
Each year 20 to 30 of these require 
an Emergency Social Services (ESS) 
response to provide basic needs support 
to evacuees with no alternative shelter or 
support networks.

Resilience in Action:  
Adapting to Sea Level Rise  
and Coastal Flooding

In 2014, the City of Vancouver 
completed a Coastal Flood Risk 
Assessment and set new flood 
construction levels. Today, work 
is ongoing to identify mitigation 
options to protect people and 
property. This leading-edge work 
sets a strong foundation for the 
continued integration of resilience 
objectives and hazard analysis into 
city planning and policy.

Earthquakes — Understanding Local Risks 

Our region is vulnerable to three types 
of damaging earthquakes shown in the 
graphic below: (1) A Cascadia subduction 
Zone megathrust earthquakes that could 
result in a 9.0 earthquake; (2) shallow 
crustal earthquakes that occur closer 
to the surface and pose significant 
risks to Vancouver; and (3) deep intra-
slab earthquakes that are usually less 
damaging but more frequent.

In 2018 City staff convened an advisory 
committee of world-leading technical 
experts to assist us to improve our 
understanding of the earthquake risk 
and to shape policy to mitigate risk to 
buildings in Vancouver. In partnership 

with Natural Resources Canada, the 
University of British Columbia and 
local engineers, the City conducted a 
seismic risk assessment including over 
90,000 buildings. 

For the first phase of our risk assessment 
of buildings we examined a shallow 
crustal 7.3 magnitude earthquake 
centred in the Strait of Georgia, similar  
to the 2011 earthquake which took place 
in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Modelling will continue to evolve, 
but this assessment provides us 
with the information necessary to 
develop targeted policy to reduce 
risk, prevent loss and support our 
community to recover.

What could an earthquake mean 
for Vancouver? 

If the modelled magnitude 7.3 strait of 
Georgia earthquake were to happen 
today, the city of Vancouver would 
experience major damage including:

 Ì More than 10,000 of the 90,000 buildings 
in Vancouver would be unusable for an 
extended time; more than 4,000 of those 
buildings would likely require demolition

 Ì More than 150 buildings would 
likely collapse

 Ì large sections of downtown, the West 
End and the Downtown Eastside would 
be heavily damaged and need to be 
cordoned off, leaving them inaccessible 
for months or even longer

 Ì Buildings and businesses located along 
commercial corridors would suffer 
significant damage, slowing response and 
delaying recovery

 Ì Nearly half of the city’s residents would 
be displaced for more than a month, 
with almost 150,000 for more than 
three months 

 Ì More than 11,500 people are likely to be 
injured, and of those more than 1,100 
could be severely injured or die

 Ì Financial losses from building damage 
alone are estimated to be in the order 
of at least $8 billion in Vancouver

Resilience in Action:  
VanSlam 2019

The Vancouver Emergency 
Management Agency and OEM, with 
VEMA, oversees a comprehensive 
staff training and exercise program. 
In 2019, Vancouver held Exercise 
Vanslam, a full-scale training exercise 
involving nearly 700 participants, 
including volunteers, first responders, 
building inspectors, city departments 
and external agencies active at 30 
sites, to test the City’s response and 
communications plans. The exercise 
included activation of the Urban Search 
and Rescue Team, Disaster staging 
Areas, Emergency social services 
and Emergency and Departmental 
Operations Centres. Although the city 
has robust plans in place, the damage 
from an earthquake means that many 
locations and people will remain 
inaccessible, and mitigation must 
remain a key priority to reduce risk.

Resilience in Vancouver will grow 
through efforts across many scales. The 
Resilient Vancouver strategy honours 
and builds upon the deep knowledge 
and generational work of community 
members and organizations, businesses, 
institutional partners and city government 

to understand and address pressing 
urban issues. It is not the intent of this 
strategy to duplicate that work, but 
rather to elevate and learn from it. 

This strategy is built on the premise that 
shocks and disasters are inevitable in 
our complex world, and that actions to

reduce risk must also contribute to day-to-
day resilience. The strategy recognizes the 
need to seek and invest in co-beneficial 
actions and to empower partners and 
communities to participate in this work.

Our strategy focuses on building 
knowledge and capacity where gaps 
exist, including related to earthquake 
and disaster resilience, and in changing 
the way we plan and operate to better 
anticipate and prepare for changing 
future conditions. 

The Resilient Vancouver strategy is 
built upon five guiding principles, and 
structured around three priorities. 

5 GUIDING PRINCIPLES

3 PRIORITIES

12 OBJECTIVES

40 ACTIONS

Each priority area contains focused 
objectives and specific actions. These 
build on and complement existing 
work by the City of Vancouver, while 
also addressing significant gaps and 
risks. The objectives provide high-level 
direction, while the actions are near-term 
opportunities to enhance resilience. A 
number of actions are already underway, 
and others will be refined and initiated 
between 2019 and 2021.

Guiding Principles

Throughout our research and 
consultation, staff heard that continued 
work to advance reconciliation, equity 
and sustainability are critical to the long-
term resilience of our city, and must 
be pursued in concert with strategies 
to enhance resilience to shocks and 
stresses. Further, we heard that 
respectful, reciprocal relationships set the 
foundation for the collective action and 
trust required to address our greatest 
challenges. We also heard that we should 
ensure that our strategy doesn’t stop 
at survival, but that it focuses on the 
capacity of our community to heal and 
recover in the aftermath of shocks. The 
following five principles underpin our 
strategy and will guide the refinement 
and implementation of actions towards 
our objectives.

RECONCILIATION

EQUITY AND INTERSECTIONALITY

As Vancouver is on the unceded 
territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓ əm 
(Musqueam), Sḵwx̱ wú7mesh 
(Squamish) and səl̓ ilwətaɁɬ / sel̓ íl̓ witulh 
(Tsleil-Waututh) Nations, who 
have lived here for millennia, it is 
essential that we continue to build 
reciprocal relationships recognizing 
their generous and resilient cultures 
and take direction from them. 
Vancouver’s reconciliation journey 
is just beginning, and this work is 
inextricably linked to resilience in 
our community.

The impacts of shocks and stresses 
are not equal for all people. Systems 
of oppression like colonization, 
racism, sexism and classism are 
stresses that impact people on a daily 
basis, and these power systems are 
amplified in the context of shocks. 
Truly advancing resilience means 
elevating and supporting people 
within our community that are most 
at risk and have been systematically 
excluded from power structures 
for generations. We can do this by 
prioritizing equity and intersectionality 
in all of our work. Moving forward, 
as Vancouver’s Equity Framework 
evolves, the resilience team will 
revisit and reassess our work, and 
integrate emerging principles and 
accountability mechanisms. 

SUSTAINABILITY 

RECOVERY

RECIPROCITY

Social, economic and environmental 
sustainability are long-term values 
that are championed through a range 
of city strategies and initiatives. 
Our ability to withstand shocks in 
the future relies on the health and 
well-being of current and future 
generations, the maintenance and 
regeneration of natural systems, 
the mitigation of climate change, 
the protection of biodiversity and 
inclusive economic development. 
Initiatives to enhance resilience must 
abide by the principle of sustainability 
and vice-versa. Vancouver has a 
strong foundation to build on this 
regard, and must continue to lead, act 
and advocate for bold innovation and 
action towards social, environmental 
and economic sustainability. 

Our first priority as government is 
protecting and facilitating the health, 
wellness and safety of the residents 
and visitors to our city. Recovery 
means moving beyond a focus on 
response and survival in the face 
of shocks and stresses. It means 
planning and designing physical and 
social systems and structures that 
are flexible, adaptive and redundant 
enough to bounce back when they 
experience shocks, and intentionally 
planning to regenerate and ‘build 
back better’ when crises occur. A 
focus on recovery includes post-
event planning as well as investment 
in mitigation that minimizes the 
impact of shocks and alleviates 
chronic stresses.

This is a strategy built on 
partnerships. It has been 
supported by local knowledge 
and global networks. Strong, 
trusting relationships and diverse 
perspectives are central to solving 
tough problems. The City of 
Vancouver has convening power 
and influence, which we can 
and should leverage to support 
reciprocal partnerships that amplify 
resilience efforts. In our relationships 
and engagements, we must avoid 
simply extracting knowledge, but 
instead use these opportunities 
to build the capacity of our 
community, and recognize and value 
the resources contributed by many 
groups and individuals to make our 
city a better place.

Resilience Priority 1:  
Thriving and Prepared Neighbourhoods

Objective 1.1:  Cultivate community connections, stewardship and pride

Objective 1.2:  Empower communities to support each other during crises 

and recover after disasters

Objective 1.3:  Transform the way communities understand risk and prepare 

for local hazards

Objective 1.4:  Strengthen social and cultural services and assets

Neighbourhoods are at the intersection 
of social and economic life, and are 
where shocks and stresses play out in 
the lives of our residents. In Vancouver, 
the strength and flexibility of our social 
fabric are critical to everyday support for 
residents and businesses, and essential 
for the healing and recovery of our city 
when faced with disasters. 

When disaster strikes, our communities will 
need to rely on each other, yet too many 
residents report a lack of understanding 
of how to help themselves, much less their 
neighbours. Community organizations and 
residents articulated an urgent need for 
emergency planning and preparedness 
information and tools at the local level.

By listening to community, we heard 
that resilience includes being prepared 
for emergencies, but that it starts with 

strengthening relationships and 
empathy among diverse neighbours, 
sharing knowledge and ideas, 
contributing to problem solving and 
caring for local spaces. 

The four objectives supporting 
this priority recognize the 
foundational role of community 
relationships and connections, 
the importance of robust cultural 
and social infrastructure and the 
need to leverage local knowledge 
and creativity to prepare for and 
recover from shocks and stresses. 
Resilience in our neighbourhoods is 
enhanced by ongoing work through 
Vancouver’s Healthy City strategy, 
and that is being led by groups and 
individuals across our community.

Objective 1.1: Cultivate community connections, stewardship and pride

Resilience actions should serve a 
community in its day to day and enable 
it to recover from disasters. Supporting 
healthy social and cultural connections 
is one example of this. We know that 
social cohesion and connection to culture 
are key indicators of community health 
and well-being. They are also indicators 
of disaster resilience, and help ensure 
people bounce back (or forward) from 
crises, to feel safe in their homes and 
neighbourhoods and to thrive and 
be happy. With nearly 50 per cent of 
Vancouverites unable to identify four 
people they would call in an emergency, 
and regional projected population 
growth of 1 million people by 2040, 
building social and cultural connections 
is essential. From the community, 
we heard that resilience starts in our 
neighbourhoods, through participation 
in formal and informal activities, and 
through events that engage and 
celebrate diversity. By making space 
for dialogue, engaging newcomers 
in civic innovation and supporting 
neighbourhood-driven resilience 
initiatives, we can weave a social fabric 
that is inclusive and strong enough to 
withstand the greatest challenges.

5 4 

|  R Es Il I E N T VA N CO U V E R

1.1.A: Promote open and ongoing 
dialogue about Vancouver’s past, 
present and future

Working with partners, Vancouver will 
continue to support ongoing community 
dialogue that fosters empathy and 
understanding across diverse groups, 
and enables us to talk about hard 
issues — ranging from racism to climate 
change. The resilience team will support 
the community and city departments 
working to hold space and amplify efforts 
to elevate the current and historical 
experiences of diverse people and groups 
in Vancouver. This will be achieved by 
forthcoming initiatives like the Creative 
City Strategy, and ongoing initiatives like 
Indigenous naming of civic facilities.

1.1.C: Create Neighbourhood  
Resilience Labs

Residents and organizations have the 
capacity and interest to design and 
test new ideas to build connections 
and resilience in the places they live, 
work and play. Community members 
have requested a clear pathway and 
civic support for residents, businesses 
and community groups to test, iterate, 
launch and scale innovative ideas and 
interventions aimed at building resilience 
in their neighbourhoods. Through a 
cross-departmental effort, Vancouver 
will explore options to support 
Neighbourhood Resilience labs, physical 
locations for residents and groups to 
propose and test new ideas.

1.1.B: Promote community 
leadership opportunities  
for newcomers

1.1.D: Identify and support 
participatory budgeting 
opportunities

The Vancouver Immigration Partnership 
will work to identify strategic 
opportunities with groups such as 
student councils, parent advisory 
committees, strata councils and 
residential associations to create more 
opportunities where people of diverse 
backgrounds, languages and cultures can 
reach out and connect with each other, 
participate in local decision-making and 
create change.

Participatory budgeting aims to put 
budget decisions directly into the 
hands of local residents, and helps 
build trust and understanding between 
the community and government. It 
builds civic literacy and pride while 
decentralizing decision-making power 
into the hands of residents. Building 
on the success of the West End 
Participatory Budgeting pilot, Vancouver 
will continue to seek new opportunities 
for resident-led decision-making.

Resilience in Action:  
Sharing with Neighbours

A Thingery is a community-owned lending 
library of things located in a modified 
shipping container. A Thingery helps 
create more resilient communities by 
reducing a person’s ecological footprint, 
strengthening social connections and 
assisting in emergency preparedness. 
The Thingery is one of many projects that 
inspired the action for Neighbourhood 
Resilience labs.

Resilience in Action: Naming the 
nə́c̓ aʔmat ct Strathcona Library

Opened in 2017, the nə́c̓ aʔmat ct Strathcona 
library is the City’s first civic building with 
an official Indigenous name. nə́c̓ aʔmat ct 
Strathcona encompasses the idea of ‘we 
are one’ in the hən̓ q̓ əmin̓ əm̓  (Musqueam) 
language. This name recognizes and 
honours the Coast Salish peoples and their 
traditional unceded territories, while also 
reflecting the neighbourhood’s historic 
city name, Strathcona.

local First Nations were consulted on 
the branch name in relation to suggested 
First Nations names and the use of 
specific Coast Salish languages. The first 
full-service branch in the Strathcona, 
Chinatown and Downtown Eastside 
neighbourhoods, the building also 
includes affordable housing managed 
by the YWCA. The naming of the library 
encourages awareness of Indigenous 
heritage and reconciliation.

Objective 1.2: Empower communities to support each other during crises and 
recover from disasters

1.2.B: Support a community-led 
Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood 
Disaster Response and Recovery 
planning process 

Fifteen years ago, a consortium of 
non-profit organizations developed 
a proposal for a community-led 
emergency response plan to address 
health and wellbeing concerns for the 
Downtown Eastside. Of key concern 
is the need to ensure the continuity of 
services offered by non-profits, faith-
based and cultural organizations. Today, 
community organizations, neighbourhood 
service providers and first responders 
continue to express an urgent need 
for neighbourhood-specific, culturally 
appropriate disaster response and 
recovery plans in this neighbourhood. 
Recent earthquake and climate 

assessments point to high vulnerability of 
infrastructure in this neighbourhood. Staff 
have begun engaging with residents and 
organizations in this area, and will continue 
to work with them to determine the best role 
for the City in this process.

1.2.C: Train and support staff at 
community centres and libraries 
to participate in community 
disaster resilience

Vancouver’s libraries and community centres 
are an important part of the social fabric, with 
access to networks across the city, and may 
also serve as community Disaster support 
Hubs. Working together with the Park Board, 
Vancouver Public library and the City will 
refine plans for these centres to contribute 
to an emergency response, and provide 
training to staff to support and host Resilient 
Neighbourhoods Events and Workshops. 

Place-based planning and response 
networks are an important complement 
to government emergency plans 
and operations — especially when it 
comes to reaching vulnerable people 
at critical moments right after major 
disasters, and helping each other to 
recover afterwards. When disasters 
happen, many people will turn first to 
the organizations that they frequent 
and trust for safe and accessible care. 
local organizations and businesses 
that serve their community day-to-
day are uniquely positioned to assess 
and address the impacts that their 
communities may face during crises, 
and with the right support can mobilize 
to save lives and hasten recovery.

1.2.A: Launch and scale  
the Resilient Neighbourhoods 
Program with a toolkit  
and grants

The Resilient Neighbourhoods Toolkit, 
co-created with community partners, 
includes a suite of tools, ideas and 
exercises for all ages and abilities. 
The City is working with partners to 
design the next phase of the Resilient 
Neighbourhoods Program and to 
release the toolkit in conjunction with a 
small grant stream.

Resilience in Action: The Resilient Neighbourhoods Program 

Neighbourhood and community organizations play a key role in combatting social and economic stresses and fostering resilience. 
From the outset, the City sought to work with and learn from community, and to understand what resilience means for our 
diverse neighbourhoods. The City of Vancouver provided grants to four community partners to work closely with the Resilient 
Vancouver team to develop and pilot the Resilient Neighbourhoods Program. Over nearly two years, this program enabled 
deep engagement with community organizations, diverse neighbourhoods and residents to concurrently build resilience while 
informing actions for the Resilient Vancouver strategy.

The pilot has resulted in the co-creation and testing of community asset mapping tools, resilience action plans, delivery 
of emergency preparedness training and exercises and the sharing of knowledge, ideas and challenges across diverse 
communities. Community-based organizations demonstrated a desire to take stronger roles in leading and deepening place-

based resilience initiatives on topics including

adaptation, among others. The co-creation 
process allowed the City and community partners 
to develop a new type of working relationship 
through an ongoing, two-way dialogue that 
fostered trust and understanding. It has also 
enabled partner organizations to lead their own 
resilience building efforts. 

Key lessons from this work include the power 
of local networks and reciprocal relationships 
to sustain local action. City government, 
community-based organizations, businesses, 
academic institutions and philanthropic partners 
all have different and important roles to play in 
building resilience in our neighbourhoods, and 
all bring unique access to knowledge, resources 
and capacities. As the pilot wraps up, the City of 
Vancouver is working with multiple partners to 
capture learnings and secure support for scaling 
the program through a networked approach — 
one that supports collaboration across many 
partners to empower neighbourhood-level 
efforts to mitigate, adapt, prepare and recover 
from shocks and stresses.

Objective 1.3: Transform the way communities understand risks and 
prepare for local hazards

A recent survey on emergency 
preparedness found that 92 per cent 
of local residents are concerned about 
earthquakes, yet less than half feel 
prepared for emergencies. Through 
our consultation we heard residents’ 
concern about a lack of information 
helping them understand what risks and 
hazards may mean for them specifically, 
and that traditional messaging 
and materials about emergency 
preparedness are not appropriate 
for many residents. Motivating and 
empowering our community to act 
requires information about risks and 
hazards to be accessible, meaningful 
and relevant. leaders in this field are 
moving towards communication and 
engagement that foster collective 
action and build on lived experience. 
Through art, culture and the input of 
diverse people, Vancouver will embark 
on a journey to change the way we talk 
about risks and hazards.

1.3.A: Engage artists to explore 
and inspire creative solutions to 
complex challenges 

Artists explore, interpret and spark 
dialogue about society’s toughest 
challenges. In 2019, Vancouver and 
Melbourne will collaborate to host 
Creative Approaches to Disaster 
Resilience, a creative lab and learning 
exchange bringing together artists, 
community organizations, scientists 
and emergency managers to explore 
creative opportunities to engage the 
community in resilience conversations. 
The intent of this exchange is to seed 
new partnerships and explore options 
for ongoing and future collaboration 
between the creative sector and 
resilience efforts.

1.3.B: Launch a digital tool to help 
the public understand and prepare 
for earthquakes and climate 
change impacts

Vancouver is working with the Geological 
Survey of Canada to develop a digital 
tool that will make information about 
earthquakes, flooding, and sea level 
rise easily available online. Through a 
human-centred design process, the tool 
will provide neighbourhood-scale hazard 
and risk information, alongside actions 
that people can take to reduce risks to 
themselves and their families, homes, 
businesses and neighbourhoods. 

Around the world, artists 
are an important part 
of imagining resilience. 
Vancouver has been 
inspired by REFUGE, a 
multi-year production led by 
Arts House and supported 
by Resilient Melbourne, to 
explore climate change and 
disaster response through 
the arts.

1.3.C: Apply an intersectional lens to 
revise emergency and resilience 
education and engagement materials

By applying an intersectional lens, staff will 
consult with the community and work with 
the Province of B.C. to create new training 
methods and materials that are reflective 
of the diverse needs of our community and 
our evolving understanding of risk. This will 
not only foster awareness and empower 
specific populations, it will also strengthen 
neighbourhood planning, community 
connection and long-term self-sufficiency 
before, during and after emergencies. 

Resilience in Action: Engaging 
Youth in Emergency Preparedness

In 2019, Vancouver was host to Future 
City Builders, an initiative to engage youth 
in the future of resilient cities. Inspired 
in part by the Resilient Neighbourhoods 
Program, the Future City Builders chose 
Emergency Preparedness as the focus 
of their 2019 youth initiative, and 30 
inspiring young Vancouverites created 
bold and innovative concepts to advance 
resilience in Vancouver.

Objective 1.4: Strengthen social and cultural assets and services

Day-to-day social and cultural assets, 
including many non-profits, provide 
services like translation, food programs 
and childcare that enable more people 
to participate in the economy, be 
active in their communities and cope 
with shocks and stresses. We heard 
from many people that their personal 
resilience was bolstered by support 
from social, cultural and civic services; 
we also noted many concerns about 
growing demand for services as inequity 
grows, and limited surge capacity to 
respond in large disasters. Embedding 
resilience into the planning and delivery 
of social, cultural and civic services will 
help support our growing community in 
times of greatest need. 

1.4.A: Evaluate resilience of 
food assets and meal providers 
and services in high-risk 
neighbourhoods

During community mapping exercises, 
we heard that our physical infrastructure 
is important, to a large extent, because 
of the social and cultural services it 
supports. Food assets and low-cost meal 
providers were consistently highlighted 
for their importance to social and cultural 
connections, and for their potential role in 
disaster recovery. A study done in parallel 
with this strategy found that many were 
not well prepared to function during 
long-lasting power outages and other 
emergencies. For people that rely on 
non-profits and community kitchens for 
meals, there was recognition of the need 
to invest in the resilience of these services 
and of the opportunity to leverage them 
to provide food during emergencies. By 
supporting the ongoing work of local 
food providers, and in collaboration 
with the food policy team, Vancouver 
will develop a process to evaluate the 
resilience of food assets, starting with 
high-risk neighbourhoods.

Low-cost meal providers 
are a vital community 
asset. Coordination to 
ensure that such non-
profits can continue to 
deliver these services in 
communities day to day 
and during emergencies 
is an important step 
towards resilience.

physical and economic resilience in our 
neighbourhoods through the lifecycle 
of a project. The social value framework 
is part of an ongoing commitment to 
advance economic, environmental and 
social sustainability for all Vancouver 
residents and families. It was a key 
action of the Healthy City strategy, 
and supports priorities relating to 
reconciliation, equity, inclusion, diversity, 
accessibility and resilience.

1.4.B: Create a Capacity Building 
Action Plan and Non-profit 
Partnering Framework

The non-profit sector in Vancouver 
is economically important. The City 
relies on non-profit partners to deliver 
critical front-line services. Through 
partnership with Vancouver’s non-
profit sector, the City will create a 
framework to guide the City’s work in 
strengthening the resilience, stability 
and impact of Vancouver’s non-profit 
sector. This plan will recognize the City’s 
mutually beneficial relationship with the 
sector, and will advocate internally and 
externally for opportunities to stabilize 
organizations through robust partnering 
opportunities, workforce development 
and core, multi-year operational and 
program funding. 

1.4.C: Leverage investments in civic 
assets and infrastructure to create 
local economic opportunities

The City of Vancouver owns and 
operates billions of dollars of civic assets 
and infrastructure that contributes 
to the vibrancy and wellbeing of our 
neighbourhoods. In 2019, the City 
introduced a social Value Procurement 
Framework that ensures that, when 
appropriate, the resources invested in 
these assets will also be leveraged to 
benefit and build capacity for equity-
seeking groups, strengthening social,

Resilience Priority 2:  
Proactive and Collaborative City

Objective 2.1:  Elevate the voices of underrepresented groups to improve 

resilience outcomes

Objective 2.2: Shape an inclusive city that can adapt to changes and turn 

challenges into opportunities 

Objective 2.3: Strengthen organizational capacity to manage risk and 

recover from shocks and stresses

Objective 2.4: Advance holistic, collaborative disaster risk reduction and 

recovery planning 

The magnitude of the challenges Vancouver 
is facing exceeds what any one entity 
or group can solve alone. Thriving in 
a rapidly changing future requires the 
collaboration and commitment of people 
and groups as diverse and complex as 
the city itself. By engaging meaningfully 
with communities and facilitating external 
partnerships, Vancouver can learn from 
the knowledge and experience of local 
stakeholders and global cities. We can 
share and invest in new technologies 
and research, embed resilience into our 
planning processes and adapt City systems 
to serve our community more equitably. 
Through a spirit of reciprocity, learning and 
innovation, the objectives and actions in 
this section promote reflection, foresight 
and partnerships to collectively imagine and 
strategically create a resilient city for all.

Objective 2.1: Elevate the voices of  
underrepresented groups to improve resilience outcomes

The implementation of this strategy 
offers an opportunity to amplify 
the voices of those who experience 
shocks and stresses most acutely, 
and to build capacity and support for 
their continued participation in civic 
processes. Empowering those who are 
underrepresented in civic processes 
and decision-making will have positive 
outcomes for our entire community. 
This objective is not just about bringing 
more people to the table to participate 
— this is about creating space for 
underrepresented groups to define 
the issues and change the process so 
that outcomes work for more people. 
By meaningfully engaging with our 
diverse community we can intentionally 
strengthen our social fabric and co-
create city systems that enable more 
people to thrive.

2.1.A: Elevate and incorporate 
Indigenous knowledge and 
culture through resilience work

In support of our overarching guiding 
principle of reconciliation, In 2019 
Vancouver will hold space for and work 
with a group of local Indigenous artists 
and knowledge holders to advise on ways 
of elevating and honouring Indigenous 
knowledge, art and culture as we build 
climate and disaster resilience, and 
to explore different ways of working 
together towards resilience in the future. 

2.1.B: Leverage resilience 
initiatives to strengthen civic 
literacy and access for 
underrepresented groups

Civic literacy and trusting relationships 
are pre-requisites to meaningful 
engagement with diverse groups. 
Through the Resilient Vancouver 
process, we have heard many ideas 
from the community about how to 
support meaningful civic engagement. 
By continuing to partner with trusted 
community organizations, using plain 
language and making available resources 
required for culturally competent and 
accessible engagement, Vancouver will 
use this strategy to advance civic literacy 
and evolve engagement processes.

2.1.C: Deepen our understanding 
of the experiences of diverse 
women and youth (inclusive of 
trans*, gender-diverse, two-spirit 
people and cis women) regarding 
climate change and disasters

In conjunction with the Women 
Deliver conference, staff will convene 
an event and initiate a dialogue to 
hear and learn from the experiences 
of diverse women and girls as they 
relate to disasters, climate change 
and emergencies. This is one tangible 
action informing an evolving process 
to apply an intersectional lens to 
resilience work, and to elevate and 
support the role of women in creating 
a resilient city. 

Anthonia Ogundele, Dalia Gonzalez, Chief Janice George and Vi Antoine shared their stories 
of resilience at the 2019 Women Deliver Satellite Session.

Women and Resilience 

Women play a unique and often undervalued role in disaster resilience 
and recovery. In most emergencies it is primarily women who take on 
the role of caring for those who have been injured or displaced, care 
for children and seniors and find food, shelter and social support for 
their families. While significant resources are directed at infrastructure 
redevelopment, it is the unpaid labour of women that often drives 
social and psychological recovery for families and communities.

Women are also more vulnerable to disasters. Global evidence shows 
that women and girls are less likely to survive disasters, and domestic 
and sexual violence increases following disasters. Emergency shelters 
are often unsafe or inaccessible for women and gender-diverse people, 
and this is heightened for Indigenous and Black people and women 
of colour. In the aftermath of disasters, economic gender inequity is 
reinforced. For example, in the absence of childcare and school, women 
and girls often stay home to care for families, while men return to work. 
Vancouver’s City Council is committed to gender equity. The leadership 
of women and gender-diverse people and explicit support for them in 
disaster planning, preparedness and recovery is an essential component 
of both resilience and gender equity.

Objective 2.2: Shape an inclusive city that can adapt to change 
and turn challenges into opportunities

As Vancouver embarks on developing 
a City-wide Plan, we have an incredible 
opportunity to learn from the past, 
and to embed resilience into the 
future of our urban fabric. Using new 
technologies and techniques, we can 
anticipate trends and capture emerging 
economic opportunities. Through hazard 
modelling and scenario planning, we can 
proactively reduce risk for current and 
future generations. 

2.2.A: Implement state-of-
the-art hazard modelling tools 
to reduce risk through land 
use, zoning and urban design

Vancouver is partnering with Natural 
Resources Canada to create modelling 
tools that integrate hazard information 
into land-use planning and design. For 
the first time, planners will be able to 
proactively reduce risk from multiple 
hazards through site-specific policy, 
planning and urban design.

Vancouver will be the first city in Canada 
to have access to this tool, which will 
eventually become available nationally.

|  R Es Il I E N T VA N CO U V E R

2.2.B: Enable transformative city 
planning through strategic foresight 
and scenario planning

Strategic foresight is a leading method 
for planning for uncertainty. It is used to 
anticipate and imagine different cultural, 
economic, social, political and economic 
trends, shocks and stresses and consider how 
they may interact to impact future conditions. 
In 2019, Vancouver will utilize foresight 
methods to inform an Employment lands 
and Economy study. By considering multiple 
scenarios and trends spanning automation to 
climate change, the City will not only evaluate 
demand scenarios, we can also design policy 
that shapes a resilient economy, able to adapt 
to inevitable disruptions and serve our diverse 
employment needs. Vancouver is working 
with leaders in this field to explore how this 
approach can be expanded to other city 
planning processes, and to build capacity for 
staff and stakeholders.

2.2.C: Develop a dynamic building 
lifecycle database

Vancouver has an opportunity to improve the 
analysis and tracking of city priorities, ranging 
from safety to affordability, by improving the 
way information about buildings is recorded 
and stored. Vancouver will learn from other 
cities to scope and develop a Dynamic Building 
lifecycle Database to track seismic and energy 
retrofits and other city metrics, and to support 
planning and development processes that 
advance the City’s resilience objectives.

Artists play a central role in helping 
community to imagine a resilient future.

2.2.D: Create and test a  
Resilient Neighbourhood  
Design Framework

In collaboration with global experts and 
City departments, the City Design studio 
is developing a neighbourhood design tool 
that connects physical design indicators 
with resilience objectives. This tool enables 
planners to evaluate the co-benefits and 
trade-offs of different design approaches 

on a wide range of objectives — from 
disaster risk reduction to walkable 
communities. Used in concert with deep 
community engagement, this tool will 
support better outcomes and ensure 
that planners are considering multiple, 
intersecting issues in the design of 
communities. This tool is currently being 
refined and will be piloted first in the 
Southeast False Creek neighbourhood.

Sample outputs from the Resilient Neighbourhood Design Framework. Indicators are being established to evaluate 
resilience across a range of intersecting factors. The tool will help planners model the potential impacts of different 
options and evaluate outcomes.

Objective 2.3: Strengthen organizational capacity to 
manage and recover from shocks and stresses

A stable city government is essential for 
a resilient community. City operations, 
finances and staff are all impacted by 
shocks and stresses. Coordinating internal 
efforts to manage hazards and embed 
resilience throughout the organization 
will bolster our capacity to anticipate and 
withstand inevitable shocks. By building 
on our current strengths and applying 
the United Nations Sendai Framework 
for Disaster Risk Reduction, our staff and 
our City can support fiscally responsible, 
proactive and life-saving actions for 
current and future generations.

2.3.A: Align city governance, 
resources and policy related 
to climate and earthquake 
mitigation, adaptation and 
risk reduction

Staff have identified an opportunity 
to strengthen coordination and 
governance of actions related to risks 
and hazards. By working together, 
Resilience, sustainability, Emergency 
Management, and Risk Management 
teams can streamline risk reduction and 
adaptation efforts and resources through 
City-coordinated decision-making and 
planning processes for our greatest 
hazards. This aligns with the Sendai 
Framework and leading international 
resilience and adaptation practices.

70 

|  R Es Il I E N T VA N CO U V E R

2.3.B: Connect emergency 
management and business 
continuity planning processes 

Emergencies impact city staff and 
departments in many ways. Staff may 
be affected personally, and they may 
also be called upon to lead emergency 
operations. This means departments 
need to make decisions about how to 
support staff during recovery and focus 
limited resources. Ensuring the continuity 
of City services goes hand in hand with 
effective emergency management for 
the public. Currently business continuity 
planning is done independent of the 
development of emergency plans. 
Connecting these processes is important 
to identify resource gaps, ensure that 
staff understand their role in emergencies 
and maintain critical levels of service. This 
is also important for advising the public 
about what they can and cannot expect 
from the city when emergencies happen. 

2.3.C: Evaluate and embed 
resilience into financial planning 

In 2019 Vancouver City Council approved 
a budget and capital plan emphasizing 
resilience as a key objective of the City’s 
investments, and recognizing the need 
for new tools to support the integration 
of resilience into financial planning and 
budgeting. The Finance Team, together 
with the Resilience Team, has worked 
with 100RC platform partners to review 

leading practices and lessons learned 
from municipalities that have experienced 
shocks. This will inform the development 
of a conceptual model to support 
municipalities to identify impacts of 
different shocks and stresses and adopt 
processes to support long-term financial 
resilience, alongside objectives including 
sustainability and equity. 

2.3.D: Align local action with the 
United Nations Sendai Framework 
for Disaster Risk Reduction 

The United Nations (UN) Sendai 
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
2015–2030 draws on experiences of 
past global crises to provide a holistic 
approach that prioritizes disaster 
prevention and recovery. The Framework 
has recently been adopted by both the 
Government of Canada and the Province 
of B.C., and is increasingly being applied 
by progressive cities and communities 
working to build resilience to multiple 
hazards. By aligning with the UN sendai 
Framework, Vancouver can exemplify 
leading practices, share a common 
approach across decision makers and 
ensure that our actions towards disaster 
risk reduction and resilience amplify 
and integrate our social, economic and 
environmental sustainability objectives. 
As a next step, staff will work across 
departments and with partners to assess 
opportunities for local application and 
implementation of the Sendai Framework.

Objective 2.4: Advance holistic, collaborative disaster 
risk reduction and recovery planning

Pre-planning for recovery is essential 
to support communities to bounce-
forward after a shock, to re-start the 
economy and to achieve equitable 
outcomes through well-managed re-
development. In the absence of a strong 
recovery framework, communities end 
up in reactive mode, making quick 
decisions without time to evaluate their 
long-term consequences and reinforcing 
vulnerabilities through unplanned 
redevelopment. Cities and organizations 
that actively plan for recovery can 
achieve more equitable outcomes and 
opportunities for residents, reduce 
risk in the future and prevent “disaster 
capitalism”. like city-building, recovery 
and risk reduction is most successful 
when it follows a whole-of-society 
approach and recognizes the unique role 
of different stakeholders and players in 
emerging from a crisis. 

2.4.A: Create a regulatory 
framework for equitable 
post-disaster redevelopment 
in Vancouver

Redevelopment after disasters is more 
effective if planning and regulation have 
been considered in advance, and if there 
is a strong vision for recovery. Amidst 
destruction, disasters also provide a 
rare opportunity to rebuild a city that 
addresses the changing needs of all 

residents. The development of the City-wide 
Plan provides an excellent opportunity to 
imagine what our city might look like after a 
disaster, and to think about how we would 
want to rebuild a city that meets the needs 
of future generations. By working in parallel 
with the development of the City-wide Plan, 
and using scenario planning, Vancouver will 
work with partners to imagine recovery, 
and develop a framework for post-disaster 
redevelopment that minimizes recovery time 
and prioritizes “building back better”.

2.4.B: Support convening of a 
Business Recovery Roundtable

Research shows that 40–60 per cent of 
small businesses fail following a disaster. Our 
seismic assessment has identified significant 
risks to the city’s employment lands and 
commercial corridors. Economic recovery 
will rely not only on the physical resilience 
of buildings where businesses are located, 
but on the resilience of supply chains, the 
safety of employees and the capacity to 
draw people back to the city following 
a disaster. Prepared businesses can also 
be activated to provide critical response 
services and supplies. Vancouver will work 
with partners to support the convening of a 
Business Recovery Roundtable to advance 
this discussion, and advocate for a stronger 
role for the private sector in regional recovery 
planning initiatives.

2.4.C: Establish targets for 
recovery and risk reduction 
through the Pathways to Disaster 
Risk Reduction Project 

Vancouver will serve on the steering 
committee and support our partners to 
contribute to the Pathways to Disaster 
Risk Reduction project. This collaborative 
project brings together entities 
responsible for land use and 
development, critical infrastructure and 
emergency response, and provides a 
platform to set and work towards local 
and regional risk reduction and recovery 
targets (e.g., emergency shelter capacity 
and timelines and prioritization of 
recovery of critical services, economic 
activities and infrastructure). For our part, 
the City will bring local community 
partners and city staff to the table with 
seismologists, climate scientists, 
modellers and researchers to develop a 
set of risk reduction and recovery targets 
informed by science and the community. 

Resilience in Action:  
Reducing Risk Together

Today, new climate and earthquake 
data help us to pinpoint and prioritize 
infrastructure and buildings at 
greatest risk, and to see where and 
how people and businesses may be 
affected. With regional projected 
population growth of 1 million by 
2030 (not including the very real 
potential for a surge in climate or 
political migrants and refugees), 
we’re working with partners and 
creating new tools to model the way 
growth and social stresses intersect 
with aging infrastructure, climate 
change and hazards to increase the 
consequence of disruption. 

spearheaded by Natural Resources 
Canada, 10 organizations, including 
all levels of government, have come 
together to launch the Pathways to 
Disaster Risk Reduction project to 
address this challenge. 

This $4 million initiative, funded in 
part through a federal grant, aims to 
transform our regional understanding of 
the cascading impacts of earthquakes 
and climate change hazards and to 
create cost–benefit analysis tools for 
risk reduction that also incorporate 
social and economic indicators. By 
strengthening data and modelling 
capabilities and establishing indicators 
for resilience, the project will deepen 
regional collaboration and enable 
strategic investment in resilient physical 
and social infrastructure. Through 
this work, Vancouver will improve 
our understanding of infrastructure 
interdependencies and vulnerabilities, 
develop hazard modelling tools, 
evaluate social and economic impacts of 
risk reduction policy, and support local 
and regional recovery and risk reduction 
planning. Vancouver’s participation in 
this project over two years will support 
many Resilient Vancouver objectives, and 
will also include active participation from 
community partners.

Resilience Priority 3:  
safe and Adaptive Buildings and Infrastructure 

Objective 3.1:  

Improve building performance to protect lives, decrease 
displacement and accelerate recovery following earthquakes

Objective 3.2:  

Plan, design and upgrade civic facilities to serve the current 
and future needs of our diverse communities and ever-
changing environmental conditions 

Objective 3.3:   Anticipate threats and mitigate and minimize disruption to civic 

infrastructure and critical services

Objective 3.4:  

Promote regional collaboration to assess, finance and fortify 
lifeline infrastructure and supply chains 

The natural and built environments are 
inextricably linked to the well-being 
of residents and the economy. From 
earthquakes to climate breakdown, 
Vancouver’s buildings and infrastructure, 
and the essential services they provide, 
face multiple evolving pressures and must 
transform to serve the changing needs of the 
community. The regional and interconnected 
nature of our infrastructure systems, not 
to mention the cost of failure, means 
that we have a vested interest in working 
with external partners and ensuring local 
redundancies in the event of disasters. 

With respect to major disasters, the failure 
of buildings and infrastructure threatens 
lives, housing supply, affordability and 
the national economy. There are limited 
regulatory options currently available to 
make existing buildings safer or minimize 

the threat of displacement, but we 
now have the information we need 
to create targeted and effective 
policy. Vancouver must contribute 
to, and advocate for, the support 
and investment required to ensure 
that our buildings and infrastructure 
can provide safe, reliable services 
to residents and businesses 
today and under changing future 
conditions. Through the application 
of systems thinking, and the use of 
new technologies and innovative 
policy, the objectives and actions 
under this priority are targeted at 
actively reducing risk to critical 
infrastructure, buildings and services, 
while supporting the well-being of 
residents today and in the future.

Objective 3.1: Improve building performance to protect lives,  
decrease displacement and accelerate recovery following earthquakes

3.1.A: Advance performance-
based design and recovery-
based code requirements for 
critical buildings

New buildings play an important role in 
reducing our overall seismic risk. Every 
building is an opportunity to make a 
resident, city block or neighbourhood 
safer and more able to recover. Currently, 
building codes throughout Canada only 
require that buildings will not collapse in 
an earthquake — meaning new buildings 
should protect life, but may not be 
functional or inhabitable afterwards. 
starting with critical facilities, Vancouver 
will evaluate options to promote and 
achieve recovery-based design so that 
buildings can function and serve the 
community after an earthquake.

3.1.B: Formalize a cross-
departmental Resilient Buildings 
governance model

Buildings are the target and source of 
many policies and challenges — from 
affordability to reducing emissions, 
Vancouver needs an increased stock 
of resilient buildings capable of serving 
the needs of our community today 
and allowing us to better recover from 
disasters and adapt to future conditions. 
For private and civic facilities, a resilient 
buildings approach demands that we 
prioritize safety and affordability for 
tenants when considering all building 
improvements, and that we maximize co-
benefits when upgrades are taking place. 
Through an expanded Resilient Buildings 
committee, staff responsible for policy 
related to housing, affordability, green 
buildings, seismic safety, heritage and 
accessibility will work together to identify 
co-benefits, promote innovation, explore 
incentives and set targets that balance 
and support multiple priorities. 

A damaging earthquake will inevitably 
occur in Vancouver. New data and 
modelling technology have enabled 
City staff working with the expert 
seismic Policy Advisory Committee 
to evaluate the specific ways that 
different building types will perform 
and how neighbourhoods, businesses 
and people are likely to be impacted. 
This work greatly enhances our 
understanding of earthquake risk, 
expanding our ability to consider 
proactive risk reduction, mitigation and 
recovery (weeks, months and years 
before and after an earthquake) rather 
than only the immediate life and safety 
response (hours and days immediately 
after an earthquake). 

While we must continue to build 
response capacity, meaningfully reducing 
risk requires that we proactively and 
strategically address the risk posed by 
existing buildings. Through targeted 
policy, incentives, advocacy and 
collaboration with the Province of B.C., 
the City of Vancouver will set targets for 
risk reduction and initiate actions today 
to improve at-risk buildings, reduce risk 
for residents and businesses and enable 
recovery when an earthquake occurs.

In California, policy options to reduce seismic risk for buildings range from light-touch options, such 
as taking an inventory of buildings and simply notifying owners of building risk, to more intensive 
options like mandatory evaluation and retrofits. This graphic illustrates the range of options used in 
other cities with high seismic risk.

3.1.C: Complete seismic risk 
assessment and engage 
stakeholders to identify risk 
reduction and policy options for 
existing buildings

In the coming months, we will work 
to understand how different types of 
earthquakes will impact our city, to 
evaluate the impact of earthquakes 
to infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, 
water systems, communications), to 
assess secondary impacts such as fires 
or lack of access to social services and 
to understand the compounding risks 
associated with climate change and other 
hazards. We will conduct a social and 
economic assessment of earthquakes 
and of potential policy options. In 
collaboration with the Province of B.C., 
we will engage broadly with stakeholders 
to put forward a set of policy options to 
mitigate risk for existing buildings. As part 
of this work, we will develop support tools 
and advocate for incentives for home and 
building owners to take action.

Learning from Experience: Wellington & San Francisco 

In collaboration with the Province of B.C. and with support from stakeholders, 
the City will explore a broad spectrum of policy options to reduce risks to 
buildings. We will continue to learn from the experience of other cities. 

In response to national policy passed in 
2016 requiring retrofits on earthquake-
prone buildings, Wellington is prioritizing 
upgrades of buildings along critical 
transportation routes to ensure access 
and minimize disruption. Other critical 
buildings or especially weak buildings 
will also have an accelerated timeline for 
upgrade, while heritage buildings may 
be considered for extensions. 

In 2013, on the anniversary of the 
San Francisco Great Earthquake and 
Fire of 1906, San Francisco instituted 
a mandatory retrofit requirement on 
all older, wood-framed residential 
buildings with a soft storey. This 
weakness leaves more than 5,000 
of these buildings, housing over 
100,000 residents, at risk of collapse 
in a serious earthquake.

Objective 3.2: Plan, design and upgrade civic facilities to serve the current and  
future needs of our diverse communities and changing environmental conditions

City-owned civic facilities include community centres, firehalls, police buildings, public works yards and libraries 
that provide important day-to-day services, and serve as critical coordination points for response and recovery in 
the face of shocks and stresses. These facilities can serve as shelters during emergencies and will be central points 
of recovery after disasters. Investment in these facilities should be prioritized to reduce risk for our community, and 
design of the spaces must be flexible and adaptable to meet current and future community needs. 

3.2.B: Integrate updated climate 
and seismic priority projects into 
the capital plan process 

Establishing a priority framework within 
our capital plan, informed by climate 
and seismic risk reduction, represents a 
key opportunity to enhance community 
resilience, accelerate recovery and reduce 
financial risk. The City of Vancouver has 
already contributed to best practices for 
integrating climate change into capital 
planning. We will leverage this knowledge 
and expand our practice to include new 
information about neighbourhood seismic 
risk and resilience, and if required, to 
prioritize and integrate the projects with 
the greatest resilience outcomes into the 
capital planning process. 

3.2.C: Continue civic 
infrastructure resilience and 
interdependency assessments 
with Public Safety Canada

In 2017, the Resilient Infrastructure 
Working Group partnered with Public 
Safety Canada to evaluate select 
civic infrastructure using a qualitative 
review process to evaluate risk, 
interdependencies and resilience 
gaps and opportunities. This process 
complements Vancouver’s business 
continuity and asset management 
programs. Vancouver will continue to 
leverage this federally designed program 
where appropriate to assess civic 
infrastructure, and integrate outcomes 
into our Asset Management Program.

3.2.A: Explore options to 
accelerate climate and seismic 
upgrades or redevelopment of 
civic buildings to enhance 
community recovery capacity 

Redevelopment and upgrade of civic 
facilities is an important component of 
community risk reduction and recovery. 
Despite this, many civic facilities and 
emergency response buildings are not 
eligible for federal disaster mitigation 
and adaptation funding. Vancouver 
will explore options to prioritize 
and accelerate seismic retrofits and 
replacement of civic facilities to 
support post-disaster response and 
recovery in the city’s highest risk 
neighbourhoods. As part of this, we will 
explore new financing options and risk-
transfer mechanisms, and advocate for 
changes to senior government funding 
that would complement investment in 
resilient civic facilities.

Civic Facilities Seismic Program

As part of the City’s effort to evaluate 
and enhance the seismic performance 
of our civic facilities, the 1969 East 
Wing of City Hall was demolished 
in 2017, and has been replaced with 
the Helena Rose Gutteridge Plaza, 
a public open space celebrating 
Vancouver’s first female Councillor. 

The West Annex was retrofitted to fully 
meet current building code seismic 
standards and an earthquake early 
warning system has been installed 
in the West Annex. In addition to 
these buildings, the redevelopment of 
firehalls #5 and #17 is ongoing, and the 
City is undertaking seismic upgrade of 
firehall #12.

Objective 3.3: Anticipate threats and mitigate and minimize 
disruption to civic infrastructure and critical services

3.3.B: Refine and test post-
disaster assessment protocols for 
infrastructure and buildings

Building on the initiatives called for 
in the 2013 Earthquake Preparedness 
Strategy, the City will accelerate efforts 
to design processes to rapidly screen 
private and civic buildings, and critical 
infrastructure, after a major earthquake. 
Assessment is an essential first step to 
recovery, ensuring safety and allowing 
residents to repair and return to their 
businesses and homes. 

3.3.C: Establish risk assessment 
guidelines and recovery targets 
for critical infrastructure

Vancouver will update risk assessment 
guidelines to include analysis of 
interdependencies and the consequence 
of failure of critical infrastructure. 
Vancouver will convene a process 
to establish service-level recovery 
targets and timelines to inform both 
infrastructure design and emergency 
response plans. 

3.3.D: Map and design a disaster 
resilient lifelines network

Staff will work to map and assess 
feasibility for a prioritized, distributed 
network of shock-resilient lifeline 
infrastructure, including priority expansion 
of roads, bridges, hardened water and 
sewer systems and flood management 
infrastructure. This will enable emergency 
service access and delivery of resources 
to critical facilities and hard-to-reach 
neighbourhoods. As the city evolves, 
staff will explore the expansion of 
the dedicated fire protection system 
(e.g., along the Broadway corridor), 
pump stations and flood protection 
infrastructure. This approach can guide 
long-term capital investment, support 
strategic asset management and renewal, 
inform policy and regulation and create 
opportunities for partnerships, including 
external funding. 

The continuity of civic infrastructure and 
services is essential to the well-being 
of our community and our economy. 
Threats emerge not only from natural 
hazards, but from aging infrastructure, 
technological changes and intentional 
attacks. Strategically evaluating and 
investing in infrastructure can save 
money and lives, achieve co-benefits for 
community well-being, risk reduction 
and climate adaptation, and increase 
partnership opportunities, including 
eligibility for financing and grants from 
senior government. 

3.3.A: Develop a city-wide 
framework for critical 
infrastructure management and 
decision-making

Create a dedicated cross-departmental 
critical infrastructure position to develop 
and support the implementation of a 
common framework to guide critical 
infrastructure management and decision-
making, establish and update risk 
assessment guidelines and performance 
objectives for critical infrastructure, 
coordinate infrastructure resilience efforts 
across departments and contribute to 
regional and cross-sectoral infrastructure 
working groups.

Resilience in Action:  
Northeast False Creek

Northeast False Creek is one of the last 
areas in Vancouver’s downtown core to 
be developed, connecting the densely 
populated downtown peninsula and 
the proposed site of the new st. Paul’s 
Hospital. This coastal area is susceptible 
to liquefaction and coastal flooding as a 
result of former industrial activity and sea 
level rise. Resilience planning for this area 
requires special consideration.  

Through the removal of the seismically 
vulnerable viaducts, the construction of 
a resilient road network, a sea level rise 
adaptation strategy and the assessment 
and seismic upgrade design of the Cambie 
Bridge, the City is working to ensure 
that the downtown core, new hospital, 
residents and businesses in this growing 
area will be well-connected, including 
during emergencies. This approach sets a 
strong precedent for future planning, and 
inspires the design of a city-wide resilient 
lifeline network.

Map sourced from Fraser Basin Council

A worst-case Fraser 
River flood is an 
increasingly likely 
event, with catastrophic 
regional consequences 
affecting critical 
infrastructure that 
our city and economy 
requires to function.

The regional infrastructure supporting 
Vancouver’s supply chains is managed 
by different entities and vulnerable to a 
wide range of hazards and disruptions well 
beyond our jurisdictional boundaries. Robust 
local and regional supply chains directly 
support our national economy, and the 
ability of local residents to access critical 
services. As single entities, infrastructure 
owners may not be able to justify preventive 
investment or upgrades. However, when 
viewed as a system with economic and 
social impacts, the justification for multi-
stakeholder investment may emerge. 
Sharing data and information and aligning 
priorities across regional municipalities and 
infrastructure owners has been challenging. 
Today, new technologies now enable us to 
model regional infrastructure and hazards, 
and evaluate the cascading impacts of 

failure, making the case for investment. 
Globally, new financing tools are emerging 
that support investment in resilient 
infrastructure that can be explored for 
application in our region.

A key recommendation from the 2016 
Understanding Risk Conference in 
Vancouver is the development of a 
common platform for information sharing 
and resilience efforts in the region. Such 
an approach has been used successfully 
in San Francisco and Wellington to 
coordinate and reach consensus on 
infrastructure resilience targets and 
restoration priorities. The collaborative, 
reciprocal approach set out in the Resilient 
Vancouver strategy supports a similar 
model, and the City will continue to work 
across sectors and with partners to achieve 
long-term regional resilience to all hazards.

3.4.C: Support regional resilience 
efforts by sharing seismic 
assessment process, findings and 
tools with regional stakeholders 
and planning partners

In the Vancouver region, there are several 
entities working on different aspects 
of infrastructure resilience, including 
the Fraser Basin Council, Trans link, 
the Integrated Partnership for Regional 
Emergency Preparedness and various 
Metro-Vancouver committees. Vancouver 
is supportive of a regional resilience 
approach, and as our seismic assessment 
process evolves, we will engage with 
and share our process and findings with 
regional municipalities, local First Nations, 
planning entities and infrastructure 
owners. By advocating and supporting 
our partners, Vancouver can enable 
solutions and collaboration that will 
benefit the entire region.

3.4.A: Convene private and 
public sector experts to explore 
innovative financing options for 
resilient infrastructure 

Vancouver will work with insurance and 
risk finance experts, as well as regional 
stakeholders and senior government to 
explore financing options to accelerate 
investment in local and regional 
infrastructure, and to protect critical 
supply chains. Vancouver will partner to 
convene stakeholders starting in 2019. 

3.4.B: Pilot a cascading impact 
assessment process in partnership 
with the Port of Vancouver

Vancouver will partner with the Port of 
Vancouver and the Dutch non-profit 
Deltares to host a multi-stakeholder 
workshop to evaluate potential cascading 
impacts of coastal flooding across a 
variety of infrastructure and systems. 
This pilot process will start by looking at 
an area currently vulnerable to flooding 
that will be increasingly exposed as sea 
levels rise. The intent of the workshop 
is to develop a shared understanding of 
the risk and economic impact of flooding 
in order to inform near-term emergency 
planning and future adaptation measures. 

Infrastructure and Insurance 

less than half of residents 
have adequate insurance 
for local hazards, and the 
majority of municipally 
owned linear infrastructure 
(e.g., roads and water lines) 
is not insured. Even if it was, 
insurance does not prevent 
damage, and it may not 
materialize in the case of 
a major incident. A recent 
report from the C.D. Howe 
Institute confirms that without 
action to reduce risk, a major 
earthquake in our region 
would exceed risk tolerance 
thresholds for private sector 
insurance, overwhelm 
federal backstop measures 
and exceed the capacity 
for recovery at all levels of 
government14. In other words, 
this is a regional problem 
with national economic 
implications that cannot be 
addressed exclusively through 
response planning and post-
disaster recovery funding.

Looking Ahead: What does the future hold? 

Resilient Vancouver is a comprehensive strategy that lays out priority areas, objectives and 
actions for the City of Vancouver to improve resilience to both shocks and stresses over the 
short, medium and long term. 

Improving resilience means holistically targeting shocks like earthquakes and stresses like 
social isolation. No one challenge stands alone, and no one organization or government is 
solely responsible. Participation on every level, from individual to regional, and from the public, 
private and non-profit sectors, is essential to successfully building a resilient future for all. 

This strategy represents the start of a journey, one that will continue to evolve with new ideas 
and changing conditions. Moving forward, the City of Vancouver will work with partners and 
community stakeholders to establish targets for resilience that reflect our guiding principles 
of Reconciliation, Equity, sustainability, Reciprocity and Recovery. We will continue to support 
community-led and place-based initiatives to prepare for and recover from emergencies. 
We will work across silos and departments and support a human-centred approach to build 
capacity, strategically invest in infrastructure and proactively embed resilience into our plans 
and processes. Building on a strong foundation, this strategy seeks to elevate and amplify the 
incredible assets of our community and address our biggest gaps to create a city that truly 
serves everyone in both good times and bad. 

None of this work can be accomplished without strong, collaborative partnerships. At the 
closing of this strategy, we acknowledge that while the actions we take may be revised 
and renewed over time, the way we need to do this work — through committed, reciprocal 
partnerships — will remain constant. In a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world, 
shocks and stresses can only be addressed through collective action at the local, regional and 
global levels. Through collaboration, foresight, careful planning and thoughtful allocation of 
resources, we can strengthen our communities today and anticipate and manage emerging 
challenges and changes.

We are grateful for all those that have advised us so far. We hope you will join us on 
Vancouver’s resilience journey.
