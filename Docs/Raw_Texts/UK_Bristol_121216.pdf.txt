BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYExtract from 
Bristol Bristol

by Miles Chambers (Bristol Poet Laureate)

Bristol, Bristol the city that was built on the bricks of 
heroic hardship.

Bristol, Bristol the place of dreams and possibilities 
the place of creative aspirations culture commerce 
and its own seductive music.

Bristol, Bristol a place still haunted by the ancestral 
ghost that echoes the historical hangover that yet 
sobered us up to what time hasn’t changed

Bristol, Bristol. Take a walk. Be inspired. Feel the 
magical connection see a positive future come 
dance in this festival of ideas.

See, we don’t have to wait for carnival every year. 
The party is right now right here,

This very stage, the very atmosphere is encouraging 
us to lose our fear cause geographically there’s no 
no go areas round here.

Stand on the suspension bridge see the 
communities, within a community,

Integrated no segregated and in the distance you 
can almost reach out and grab Glastonbury.

Oh, city of paradoxes why all this controversy, 

Oh, conflicting urbanisation I love you but what are 
you doing to me?

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYAdmits the beauty I regularly see the women of the 
street exploiting their femininity, 

Being exploited by their calamity.

I love you Bristol, I love the clamour of the weekend 
drinkers and the hustle and the bustle of the 9-5.

I hate you Bristol as I watch every day the young 
kiddy with the old weathered face in a Tesco shop 
doorway clinging to his blanket of security begging 
to survive. 

I belong here Bristol amongst the riots and the 
protest, amongst the fighting for equality,

I belong here Bristol amongst the ranters and the 
ravers, the Gospel singers the multi-cultural students 
studying effectively,

I belong here Bristol With the Bristol blue taxis the 
cheers drive shirt and jeans top blokes braving the 
winter streets to look cool,

Oh, city of paradoxes where you gonna take me 
today. 

Oh, conflicting urbanisation are you gonna show me 
a better way.

So what fate awaits this colourful city.

We need to consider every beneficial possibility. 

Transport punctuality,

Drugs and social policy,

Religion ethnicity,

Multiculturalism and unity,

Economy and prosperity,

Education and opportunity,

Business and creativity,

Media and honesty,

Religion and spirituality,

Acknowledgement and generosity,

I belong here with the good schools offering a good 
future to a bad past. The bad schools offering a bad 
future to a good past.

It’s here on these streets that the youth are spitting 
the lyrics of the future that will change the wrong 
decisions of the past. 

I belong here! Right now in this place we have the 
opportunity to be something great, something 
amazing together… 

To utilise the collective potential of us all. That will 
make this place unique and special… Let’s answer 
the call. I belong right here!

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYLetter from the Mayor
Marvin Rees

Bristol has consistently been voted one of the best places to live. It’s a 
city full of green space, a vibrant culture known for its colourful houses, 
grand bridges, hot air balloons and Banksy. And it is a great city, a 
prosperous city, all this is true.

But there is another Bristol, one that tourists and even some of our 
citizens never see – the city of poverty and inequality. We have 42 areas 
among the 10% most deprived in England and 16% of our residents live in 
poverty. There is a persistent life expectancy gap between the most and 
least deprived areas (an estimated gap of 9.6 years for men and 7 years 
for women).

And we know that the future will be even more challenging for cities like 
Bristol. We need to be prepared for more extreme weather, a growing 
and ageing population and a changing job market. All of these factors 
will impact most on our poorest citizens unless we focus on making their 
lives, and their children’s lives, better.

That is why I am committed to taking the long view to lead Bristol 
towards a future where nobody is left behind. As set out in this 50 year 
strategy, my vision is to build a liveable city of opportunity built on 
fairness and inclusion. A resilient city, both socially and environmentally, 
which offers prosperity for all.

We cannot achieve this alone. We need all our city organisations – and 
our citizens - to work together towards shared priorities. The Resilience 
Sounding Board has modelled this new way of working and the 
Resilience Strategy gives us a compass for our future direction of travel. 
We could not have done this work without the inspiration and support of 
the 100RC and the other cities in the network and we are truly thankful 
and proud to be part of this global movement.

Building a resilient Bristol will be difficult and it will take time. But 
together we can do it if we start now.

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYMichael Berkowitz  
President of 100 Resilient Cities

Letter from the President of 100 Resilient Cities
Michael Berkowitz

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to congratulate 
the city of Bristol on the release of the Bristol Resilience Strategy. In 
this bold strategy, Bristol is taking an honest and proactive view of the 
challenges the city faces today and in the fifty years to come. It shows 
no complacency with the leaps Bristol has already made, and unlocks 
resilience paradoxes by transforming them into opportunities.

Bristol’s entrepreneurial, creative and pragmatic spirit is reflected 
throughout this strategy. It represents a call to action for all Bristolians in a 
pursuit to strengthen social and environmental justice. None of this could 
have been possible without the excellent engagement of the Resilience 
Sounding Board members. With backgrounds ranging from community 
organisations to universities and local businesses, these Bristolians ensured 
multi-stakeholder voices were heard. I also want to thank Bristol’s Chief 
Resilience Officer (CRO), Sarah Toy, for her tireless dedication in driving 
the Bristol Resilience Strategy process forward. 

The release of the strategy marks an important milestone for the city. Yet 
the work is far from over. Mayor Rees’s establishment of the City Office 
will be an innovative way to include a wide range of stakeholders working 
on resilience challenges in Bristol. Actions that address homelessness and 
enhance opportunities for meaningful work experience are but a few points 
named in this strategy that will secure a more resilient and equal Bristol.

As one of the cities selected in the first round of the the 100 Resilient Cities 
Challenge, Bristol has been on the forefront of leading our global resilience 
movement. We anticipate that the implementation of this strategy will 
become a best practice that other cities within the 100RC Network will 
emulate. We are thrilled to celebrate Bristol’s achievement in releasing the 
Bristol Resilience Strategy, and look forward to our continued partnership 
as Bristol spreads the urban resilience movement to cities across the 
United Kingdom and the world.

Sincerely,

Michael Berkowitz 
President, 100 Resilient Cities

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYFOREWORD 
FROM RESILIENCE 
SOUNDING BOARD

VISION
Our vision: By 2066 Bristol is a flourishing, welcoming city which inspires confidence 
in local and global investors, and our success is shared by all. Our neighbourhoods 
are affordable, attractive, healthy and well-connected places where people of all 
ages and backgrounds trust and help each other. Our infrastructure and services are 
flexibly designed and managed to cope with uncertainty. 

THE WORLD IS CHANGING; BRISTOL IS CHANGING

Bristol is an independent-thinking, sustainable and culturally diverse city with 
a high quality of life. Bristol is thriving. 

But there is no room for complacency. Our city – and the wider world 
with which it is vitally interdependent – is an increasingly complex and 
uncertain place. Changes are occurring at unprecedented rates in our 
economy, job markets, technology, environment, politics and population, 
and consequently our challenges are becoming both more severe and 
more unexpected. The city region’s economic and physical growth, 
consequences of our success, also mean rising resource consumption and 
greater demands on health services and infrastructure. Meanwhile, our more 
chronic challenges remain: the gap between the rich and poor in Bristol is 
unacceptably wide, and growing; our current infrastructure connects us but 
also divides us; and our ambitions to be truly sustainable are constrained by 
our own resistance to change, national and international policies, and a lack 
of appropriate financing. 

These challenges will not be resolved quickly; they will require investment, 
greater trust and social cohesion, and new social and technological 
innovations. Building a resilient future will be difficult and it will take time. 
And so it must start now.

That journey, however, is also an opportunity. The truly resilient cities of the 
21st century will not simply manage risk or deal with challenges. They will 
evolve and become stronger through creativity, adaptability and flexibility. 
By enabling the capacity and ingenuity of all of their citizens, these cities will 
use every disaster, crisis or challenge to recover in a stronger, smarter and 
fairer way. 

Bristol believes that 
resilience = flourishing 
for all in the face of 
future uncertainty

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYCOLLECTIVE ACTION

The vision of resilience articulated here is a distinctively ‘Bristol’ vision, 
and it is a genuinely collective one, emerging from not only rigorous data 
analysis but also the experiences and opinions of thousands of Bristolians, 
as well as national and international friends. The Resilience Sounding Board 
was created to provide diverse perspectives and to critically challenge one 
another and the political leadership of the city. The Board includes those 
familiar with the expected resilience topics, including infrastructure, planning, 
climate change, disaster management and transport, but also those familiar 
with digital media, finance, social cohesion and the voluntary sector. But the 
Board knows that it does not have most of the answers, nor speak for all of 
Bristol, and we hope that we have approached this task with humility. We 
have engaged over 1600 people from across the city and we have learned 
from and been inspired by them. Moreover, many of our Board members 
embarked on complementary initiatives, bringing in the perspectives of 
thousands of others. Throughout, our approach was to look backwards from 
a 50 year future vision to the present day, debating and discussing where 
and how we can work together with confidence to unlock creativity, disrupt 
business as usual and take the “right” next steps to set us on course. We 
thank all of you with whom we have engaged and all of those with whom we 
hope to engage soon.

Based on those diverse perspectives, we have co-created this Resilience 
Strategy, comprising a 50 year vision, resilience pillars, goals and 
transformative actions, all outlined in this document. In the spirit of 
resilience, this is not a fixed strategy replete with actions that might become 
inappropriate in our changing world, but rather a framework. There are 
too many unexpected challenges awaiting us and too many brilliant ideas 
waiting to be unleashed to dictate what actions must be taken. More 
fundamentally, resilience is not about proposing simple solutions to complex 
problems but about creating a political, cultural, and social framework that 
embeds resilience in every day decision-making. To stimulate action and 
debate we do propose some initial actions, but we intend these to be only 
the start, seeds of change, that along with many others will help our city 
adapt, survive and flourish in the face of future uncertainty.

NAVIGATING OUR JOURNEY

This Strategy – in the spirit of something that is both complex and 
collaborative – is intended to be a dynamic process that will change over 
time as more people become involved, our collective thinking evolves and 
new challenges and opportunities emerge. We did not start from scratch, 
but built on some visionary work already done in the city such as High in 
Hope 2050 produced by The Initiative, Business West1. We see this Strategy 
as a compass by which to seek and find a wide range of exciting and 
transformative actions – many of which have not yet been thought of or 
tested at a city scale.

In other words, we are on a journey. The Strategy will need to have a clear 
owner and be resourced to make sure it can be implemented. Eventually, it 
must be adopted and its spirit incorporated across the city; but crucially at 
this early stage, it must be embedded in the political institutions of Bristol.

Therefore, we call for a legacy structure that can implement the first steps 
of this Strategy while convening a city-wide approach to building resilience. 
But that legacy eventually will be owned by all of us, and so this document is 
most of all…

AN OPEN INVITATION 

The members of the Sounding Board are fully committed to supporting the 
delivery of this Strategy, whether as representatives of their organisations 
or as your fellow citizens. We hope that it can catalyse new ideas and 
inspire all of us to work together. We invite you – as an individual or as part 
of an organisation - to be part of this exciting journey. Contribute to the 
development of the initiatives proposed here and propose your own. Share 
your plans to become more resilient and your plans to help others. Challenge 
yourselves, each other and us to live up to the ideals presented here. We 
must be creative, flexible and adaptable but most of all, we must work 
together - the best way to become resilient is for all of us to become resilient.

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY1. INTRODUCTION 
AND CONTEXT

WHY URBAN RESILIENCE?

We live in a fast-changing, globally connected world. Bristol, like many other 
cities, faces challenges from a growing and changing population, climate 
change, resource scarcity, ageing infrastructure, changing patterns of world 
markets and employment, disruptive technologies and social and health 
inequalities. Currently, economic and physical growth is coupled with a 
growth in resource consumption, a trajectory that Bristol and other cities 
around the world will be unable to sustain as they continue to expand.

The scale of urban risk, in particular, is increasing due to the growing number 
of people living in cities. Risk is also increasingly unpredictable due to the 
complexity of city systems and the uncertainty associated with many 
hazards – most notably climate change. Communities and economies will 
need to develop the capacity to survive, adapt and thrive in the face of 
multiple and unpredictable disruptions in order to be resilient.

With growing recognition of these challenges, programmes to build 
“resilience” are being developed and implemented by a range of 
international, national and local organisations. 

Resilience is a term that emerged simultaneously from the fields of 
engineering, ecology and psychology in the 1970s, to describe the capacity 
of a system to maintain or recover functionality in the event of disruption or 
disturbance. It is applicable to cities because they are complex systems that 
are constantly adapting to changing circumstances.

100 Resilient Cities (100RC) — Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation 
supports 100 selected cities around the world to become more resilient to 
physical, social and economic shocks and stresses across the city system 
(www.100resilientcities.org). 100RC provides this assistance through:

•  Funding for a Chief Resilience Officer(CRO) position for two years

•  Resources and support for preparing a resilience strategy

•  A network of cities which face a diverse range of resilience challenges 

and provide opportunities for information sharing

•  A range of services brought to the city public, by private and academic 

organisations (called Platform Partners)

All 100RC member cities have used the same working definition of urban 
resilience: 

Urban resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt 
and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute 
shocks they experience.

11

Currently, economic 
and physical growth is 
coupled with a growth in 
resource consumption, 
a trajectory that Bristol 
and other cities around 
the world will be unable 
to sustain as they 
continue to expand.

Stresses are chronic conditions which weaken the fabric of a city on a daily 
or cyclical basis; examples include high unemployment, health inequalities, 
inefficient public transport systems, endemic violence, and chronic food or 
water shortages. Acute shocks are sudden, sharp events such as terrorist 
attacks, fires, floods, earthquakes, and disease outbreaks.

By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able 
to respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic 
functions in both good times and bad, to all communities.

S t a k e h o l der engagement

The qualities of resilient systems shown in Figure 1 are important in 
preventing the breakdown or failure of a system or of enabling appropriate 
or timely action to be taken. Cities can determine their overall resilience 
by understanding the presence or absence of these qualities within their 
systems and services.

Bristol has taken the broadest possible view of resilience to help understand 
how the city can continue to flourish in the face of rapid change. Our focus 
is on ensuring that resilience helps to break away from “business as usual” to 
take the city towards a flourishing future by securing multiple, cross-sectoral 
benefits from every (resilience-related) initiative undertaken.

We also want to demonstrate our commitment to delivering the global 2030 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as they provide an overarching, long 
term framework which reconciles environmental priorities with equality and 
economic opportunity.

100RC is particularly exciting for Bristol as it builds on the success of the 
city’s year as 2015 European Green Capital. Joining the 100RC Network is 
an opportunity to consolidate the city’s ambition to be a world leader in 
resilient and sustainable city development. Our view is that sustainability and 
resilience are inextricably linked.

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYThis Bristol 50 Year 
strategy sets out a 
direction of travel to:

Bring city stakeholders 
together around a shared 
vision and ambitions.

Encourage a city-wide 
conversation about our 
common future.

Model a new form 
of collaborative city 
leadership.

WHY NOW AND WHY 50 YEARS? 

In Bristol our resilience work is looking forward 50 years, to 2066 and beyond. 
We have used a range of tools and engagement methods, with support 
from the Government Office for Science Foresight Future of Cities Team and 
others, to develop a shared vision of the future and a direction of travel.

By developing an ambitious, long-term trajectory for the city, Bristol can rise 
to the global and local challenges that we face. Working backwards from a 
50 year future to the present, we aim to unlock creativity and innovation and 
be confident that we are taking appropriately bold and ambitious steps in 
the short term.

This 50 year look ahead has helped us to realise the need for action now. In 
order to develop a flourishing future for Bristol, and improve our resilience 
to future uncertainty, we cannot wait for change to happen in the future. 
The UN recognises that people are already moving because of climate 
stresses and changing weather patterns2. Many people are already taking 
action on issues such as these globally. Bristol has the opportunity to be 
at the vanguard of change - for example by leading on the Sustainable 
Development Goals, but more action is required across sectors now to move 
us to a flourishing future for the city.

LEARNING FROM OUR PAST

Bristol’s growth and change as a major city since its humble beginnings in the 
11th century has much to teach us about future resilience. Significant social 
shifts can happen quickly and transform the city (as was seen through the 
closure of docks or building of the M32, for example) whilst other aspects of 
the city seem to go in cycles (immigration, regional governance for example). 
Being a resilient city means taking all of this in our stride, whilst constantly 
placing the welfare and quality of life of citizens at the heart of all action.

Over the past centuries, we have seen a number of transformations in our 
city. These stories can help to inform our future trajectory:

•  We’ve moved from being an important node in the slave trade, to bus 

boycott and riots, to electing the first mayor of African or Caribbean 
heritage in Europe in 20163.. 

•  Bristol has strong association with Isambard Kingdom Brunel and the 
history of the railways, and has had a major port for centuries. In 2003 
Concorde’s last ever flight marked Bristol’s significance as a hub for the 
aerospace industry, and in 2016 Bristol is home to a driverless car pilot4. 

14

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYOur Chief Resilience 
Officer, Sarah Toy 
(pictured above) led 
the development of this 
resilience strategy and 
is responsible for the 
integration of resilience 
thinking across the 
city, linking to a global 
network.

•  Bristol’s food history was marked by significant family businesses such 

as Fry’s chocolate manufacturer, and is now a hub for independent 
food production and retail, winning silver status as a Sustainable Food 
city in 20165. 

•  Bristol’s cultural history is significant; Bristol Old Vic is the oldest 
continually-operating theatre in the English speaking world6; and 
continues to evolve, with world-class 21st century animations and as 
home to Europe’s largest street art festival, Upfest.

•  The tobacco industry was a significant employer in Bristol, with Wills 

having the largest factory in Europe in 19707. In the 21st century, we are 
spearheading anti-smoking action, with the first outdoor spaces in the 
UK designated as ‘no smoking’ in 20158. 

•  Civil protest around change has always been a feature of life in Bristol, 
with bridge tolls in 1793 and resident parking charges in 2015 sparking 
protests.

UNLOCKING THE FUTURE

Bristol is internationally recognised as a city leader in renewable energy and 
smart city digital innovation. It is also proud of its independent spirit and its 
sense of creativity and fun. 

This means that there is already a wealth of initiatives across the city 
challenging “business as usual” thinking, with the aim of disrupting patterns 
to stimulate new (positive) behaviours. These initiatives – being spearheaded 
by public, private, voluntary and community organisations and individuals – 
are all important parts of the resilience jigsaw as they provide weak signals 
of future change. The city now has an opportunity to build on and connect 
these initiatives to underpin our resilience-building activities.

The development of the 50 year strategy, led by the Chief Resilience Officer 
(CRO) Sarah Toy, has prompted us to think more deeply about what these 
innovations have in common and what they collectively signal about the 
future of the city and their potential for scaling up.

City “pattern disrupters” have been identified as already challenging business 
as usual; these range from the establishment of municipal energy and 
waste companies to the development of Bristol’s own currency, the Bristol 
Pound9, and from the development of a Bristol approach to citizen sensing10 
to a new approach to river catchment management. Each of these actions 
either stretch the current system in some way, or operate outside the system 
entirely. Either way, they are actions that could begin to transform the city’s 
systems if they are scaled up.

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY2. UNDERSTANDING 
RESILIENCE

OVERVIEW

Throughout the resilience process we have modelled some of the 
complexity of systems changes by creating an iterative, non-linear, human-
centred or so-called “messy” method, involving: building new relationships 
(and challenging existing ones), talking about shifting power and engaging 
in open-space conversations and encouraging non-linear collective inquiry 
and collaboration.

This also involved mirroring some of the qualities of resilience - striving 
always to be reflective, inclusive, flexible and integrated.

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYAPPROACH

As a Bristol citizen, the CRO felt strongly that everyone should have a stake in 
the city’s future resilience. The approach taken was to build an open, inclusive 
process, tapping into existing networks and groups wherever possible. 

Bristol already has a highly engaged stakeholder community, which has 
gone from strength to strength during 2015 due to the city’s European Green 
Capital status. It was therefore important to build on this sense of shared 
priorities and encourage city dialogue throughout the resilience assessment 
process. Over 1,600 people were engaged in meetings, focus groups, 
workshops and events.

The aim was to create as many opportunities as possible for strategic 
partners and stakeholders across the city and region and across the 100RC 
global network to work together to explore innovative ways in which co-
benefits can be delivered through collective inquiry and collaboration.

The stakeholder engagement was complemented by a robust analysis of 
available data to review our shocks, stresses, strengths and weaknesses, and 
to understand how the city operates in order to focus efforts to strengthen 
our resilience and help Bristol to flourish over the coming 50 years.

A range of more detailed research and analysis of our selected themes and 
discovery areas was undertaken, in order to improve our understanding of

be addressed through the Resilience Strategy. This work was co-ordinated 
by the CRO, and undertaken by a range of stakeholders in working teams, 
supported by Arup where appropriate for certain tasks.

Much of this research surfaced opportunities for interventions that could 
be included in this Resilience Strategy. In addition, we also sought input 
from a range of stakeholders. We applied a multi-criteria analysis to these 
opportunities, to identify those that would most effectively address 
Bristol’s specific resilience challenges. This evaluation included a high-level 
assessment against the drivers of resilience as set out in the City Resilience 
Framework (CRF), that have been considered most significant for Bristol; 
the critical shocks and stresses that were identified; and the qualities of 
a resilient city. This was then complemented by our knowledge of Bristol 
and the activity that was most likely to lead to transformation as a result of 
being scaled up. 

Meets basic 
needs

Supports 
livelihoods & 
employment

Particulary in times of crisis, ensure that people have access to the basic resources necessary to survive – food, water and 
sanitation, energy, and shelter.

Assist individuals to access diverse livelihood and employment opportunities, including access to business investment and 
social welfare. This includes skills and training, fair labour policy, and development and innovation.

Ensures public 
health services 

Provide access to effective public healthcare and emergency services to safeguard physical and mental health. This 
includes medical practitioners and plans, as well as clinics and ambulances.

Promotes 
cohesive and 
engaged 
communities

Create a sense of collective identity and mutual support. This includes building a sense of unified local identity, social 
relationships and networks through safeguarding spaces in which city residents are able to interact together to build and 
maintain relationships; promoting features of an inclusive local cultural heritage; and encouraging cultural diversity while 
promoting tolerance and a willingness to accept other cultures.

Ensures social 
stability, security 
and justice

Ensure a comprehensive approach to law enforcement and justice to ensure a stable, secure and just society. This includes 
fair and transparent policing and deterrents to crime – specifically in times of crisis, as well as enforcement of laws such as 
building codes and regulations.

Fosters 
economic 
prosperity

Provides and 
enhances natural 
and man-made 
assets

Ensures 
continuity of 
critical services

Provides reliable 
communication 
and mobility

Promotes 
leadership 
and effective 
management

Empowers a 
broad range of 
stakeholders

Fosters long-
term and 
integrated 
planning

Ensures availability of funding and a vibrant economy as a result of diverse revenue streams, the ability to attract business 
investment, and contingency plans. This includes good governance, integration with the regional and global economy and 
measures to attract investment.

Maintain protective natural and man-made assets that reduce the physical vulnerability of city systems. Importantly, this 
includes natural systems like wetlands, mangroves and sand dunes or built infrastructure like sea walls or levees.

Actively manage and enhance natural and man-made resources. This includes designing physical infrastructure such as 
roads and bridges to withstand floods so that people can evacuate, as well as ecosystem management to for flood risk 
management. It also includes emergency response plans and contingency plans that may coordinate airports to function so 
that relief can be lifted in and out during a crisis.

Provide a free flow of people, information, and goods. This includes information and communication networks as well as 
physical movement through a multi-modal transport system.

Encourage capable leadership and effective urban management within government and civil society, particularly during an 
emergency. This includes strong leadership, cross-sector communication and evidenced-based decision-making.

Ensure everybody is well informed, capable and involved in their city. This includes access to information and education, 
communication between the government and public, knowledge transfer, and timely and appropriate monitoring.

Align sectoral plans and individual projects with the city’s vision, to be coordinated and appropriate to address the city’s 
needs. This includes city strategies and plans.

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY3. RESILIENCE 
PARADOXES

Our work has identified 
five key paradoxes 
that articulate Bristol’s 
challenges at different 
city scales – from 
the individual to the 
community to the 
regional and global 
context.

Bristol, as an economically developed city with limited exposure to natural 
shocks, is a city that, in many ways, is thriving. Our resilience challenge is 
largely felt in underlying stresses and growing global uncertainty, such as 
our changing climate or health inequalities in the city. Its successes lie in its 
pioneering and independent spirit and personality. It is a city with vibrant 
cultures and a high quality of life. We want to use the concept of resilience to 
help Bristol to flourish today as well as in the future. 

Our work has identified five key paradoxes that articulate Bristol’s challenges 
at different city scales – from the individual/community to the regional and 
global context. These five paradoxes are derived from our analysis of the 
shocks and stresses that threaten Bristol’s resilience.

PEOPLE

PLACES

ORGANISATIONS

Communities are diverse, 
but inequality threatens 
cohesion

Built environment is 
‘greened’ but not yet 
transformed

Bristol’s population is diverse, with 45 
religions, 91 languages and 187 places 
of birth. This diversity, which is set to 
increase over the coming decades, is 
part of what makes the city a vibrant 
place to live. At present, we largely 
co-exist respectfully and peacefully 
but inequality between different 
communities and neighbourhoods 
compromises social cohesion. The 
root causes of inequality, coupled 
with the challenge of a rapidly ageing 
population (there will be 120% more 
people aged over 90 in Bristol by 
2039), need to be tackled to ensure 
that in the future the city is made 
up of socially cohesive communities 
with all individuals having the assets 
and capacity to thrive.

Bristol is seen as a ‘green’ city, having 
been the first UK city to hold the title 
of European Green Capital in 2015. 
Ambitious public commitments have 
been made to be zero carbon by 
2050. However, we know that more 
audacious, bolder steps are needed 
to transform the built environment 
and people’s behaviours. We also 
know that increasing uncertainty, 
particularly in relation to a changing 
climate, means that we need to 
adapt to future uncertainty and risk. 
Managing stresses such as transport 
congestion and ageing infrastructure 
is an important part of this challenge. 
Radical solutions, coupled with new 
forms of financing, must be secured to 
transform Bristol into an attractive and 
prosperous post-carbon city.

Civil society is engaged, 
but not connected

Many parts of the city are already 
highly engaged in working 
collaboratively to plan the future of 
the city, from grassroots activists to 
academia, from third sector bodies 
to City Council teams, from youth 
councils to partnership bodies, but 
this enthusiasm to cooperate is 
not always harnessed. Power is still 
perceived to lie, in top-down, siloed 
systems that operate in short-term 
political cycles. There are also many 
citizens who feel disconnected or 
unable to influence the future of the 
city or the wider city region. The 
interests, aspirations and actions of 
citizens and civic society must be 
better connected to the city’s formal 
planning, decision-making processes 
and delivery mechanisms to create a 
truly participatory future city.

PROSPERITY AND WORTH

REGIONAL TO GLOBAL

The city is economically successful,  
but not equally flourishing

Bristol’s success is measured in economic terms by Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP)/Gross Value Added (GVA) and 
is regarded as a highly productive net contributor to the 
national economy. It is also home to a higher number of 
creative industry start-ups than any other UK core city, as 
well as having the highest number of patent registrations. 
This is despite significant differences in health, income and 
access to opportunities between different communities 
and neighbourhoods. The gap between communities 
needs must be closed so that decent opportunities 
are accessible to everyone. Housing affordability is an 
increasingly important issue for the city. 

Bristol is also increasingly recognised as a leader in next 
economy ‘pattern disruptions’ such as the Bristol Pound 
and Happy City11 and there is a strong movement to place 
more importance on the wider concept of flourishing but 
there are currently no city-scale metrics to truly value – 
and therefore aim towards - non-economic outcomes.

The city is focused on strengthening 
local self-sufficiency but continues to be 
dependent on national and global systems

Many of Bristol’s innovative projects and pattern 
disrupters are focused on promoting self-sufficiency and 
circularity of systems – for example encouraging local 
consumption and production with the Bristol Pound 
or reducing our carbon footprint and waste streams. 
However, this needs to be finely balanced with the need 
to continue to benefit from national and international 
systems and infrastructure that provide some of the basic 
services we need to function well in times of prosperity, 
as well as in times of stress. These range from our energy 
infrastructure, to the global food market and location of 
global corporations in Bristol. This national and global 
interdependency can also make us vulnerable to a range 
of external shocks that we have little control over locally. 

21

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY4. FRAMING OUR FUTURE
OUR VISION 

This sets out our long-term direction of travel. It reflects the need for change 
at all scales: stating with individual citizens, through local communities and 
neighbourhoods, to the city as a whole and its place in the wider world. 

By 2066 Bristol is a flourishing, welcoming city which inspires 
confidence in local and global investors, and our success is shared 
by all. Our neighbourhoods are affordable, attractive, healthy and 
well-connected places where people of all ages and backgrounds 
trust and help each other. Our infrastructure and services are 
flexibly designed and managed to cope with uncertainty. 

Five pillars have been developed to describe the outcomes that we can hope 
to achieve over the course of the coming decades, in support of this vision. 

These five pillars are supported by goals over the next 50 years, 
demonstrating the direction of travel for the city.

Responding to each of the five paradoxes set out in section 3 will help us to 
move towards achieving these ambitious outcomes for Bristol.

A range of innovative and disruptive actions have been developed to 
support this vision, pillars and goals as detailed in the next section.

By 2066 Bristol is a 
flourishing, welcoming 
city which inspires 
confidence in local and 
global investors, and our 
success is shared by all. 

22

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYFlourishing 
Resilient City

Fair
Every person living in Bristol has the assets  
and opportunities to enjoy a good quality of life.

Liveable
The city centre and neighbourhoods are great places  
for people of all ages to live, work, learn and play.

Sustainable
The city and region prosper within environmental limits 
through adopting new behaviours and technology.

Agile
Bristol citizens and leaders make effective decisions  
based on shared priorities and real-time information.

Connected
A strong network of local communities and organisations 
promotes trust, cooperation and shared action across the city.

Fair
Every person living in Bristol has the assets and  
opportunities to enjoy a good quality of life. 
Goals, by 2066 Bristolians will: 

•  Be free from discriminatory practices

•  Be providing opportunities for all to close the education gap

•  Provide affordable housing for all

•  Be free from child poverty

•  Be free from health inequality

•   Deliver a fair income ratio in the city between  

highest and lowest incomes

Addressing the resilience paradoxes: Achieving greater equality and social 
cohesion are crucial to increasing Bristol’s resilience: this means providing 
affordable energy, water, food, shelter and access to employment for all as 
well as ensuring everyone can take part in the life of the city.

for people of all ages to live, work, learn and play. 
Goals, by 2066 Bristolians will: 

•   Benefit, across the whole city, from the multi-functional value of green 

infrastructure and the natural environment

•  Live in an all age-friendly city, with all ages able to access all necessary 

services within a 20 minute journey by active travel or a sustainable 
mode of transport

•  Achieve clean air for Bristol

Addressing the resilience paradoxes: Green infrastructure and the natural 
environment can provide multiple benefits such as active travel, improved 
air quality, improved health and wellbeing, and reduced impacts of flooding, 
climate change, and environmental degradation, and reduced transport costs. 

Sustainable
The city and region prosper within environmental limits  
through adopting new behaviours and technology.
Goals, by 2066 Bristolians will: 

•  Develop a zero waste city

•  Live in a carbon neutral city 

•  Operate environmentally responsible and fairtrade supply chains

Addressing the resilience paradoxes: To live within our environmental limits 
we will aim to use resources (products, components and materials) to their 
highest utility in the economy. This builds resilience by reducing the impact 
of resource scarcity (e.g. energy, food, water, materials), future-proofing our 
infrastructure and our economy, and protecting our natural environment.

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYAgile
Bristol citizens and leaders make effective decisions  
based on shared priorities and real time information. 
Goals, by 2066 Bristolians will: 

•  Be using city data to reduce inequality

•  Develop new partnerships to co-create and scale up city solutions

•  Deliver local bonds and place-based investment to transform the city

Addressing the resilience paradoxes: Being more agile will help to future-
proof Bristol’s infrastructure and wider assets, whilst also promoting long-
term resilience planning rather than just short-term financial returns. It 
will also help to deliver jobs and skills for local people, whilst empowering 
citizens to support projects they are passionate about, and providing key 
infrastructure assets for Bristol.

Connected
A strong network of local communities promotes  
trust, co-operation and shared action across the city.
Goals, by 2066 Bristolians will: 

•  Be living by a city charter for shared values

•  Benefit from city-wide community cohesion

•  Design and deliver services by self-organised communities

Addressing the resilience paradoxes: By implementing actions related to 
this pillar, we aim to develop a participatory culture, by undertaking projects 
that appeal to those across a community with tangible outcomes, where 
participants contribute and benefit equally.

We know that in order to be resilient over the next 50 
years, we will need be reflective, and able to learn and 
adapt over time. We also know that Bristol is defined by 
its pioneering attitude, willingness to experiment and 
lead with engagement from a wide range of partners. 
This section sets out a collection of some – but by no means all – of the 
pattern disrupters that will challenge business as usual in the city to 
put us on a more resilient trajectory for the future. We are committed 
to delivering, catalysing or scaling these in the short to medium term.

created by Mescaldis, takes an art-led approach to build social cohesion, strengthen 
community networks, create space for dialogue about diversity and migration 
and promote intergenerational conversations. Bristol stakeholders will work with 
Mescaldis to identify an appropriate neighbourhood and local partners and funders

Votes for  
16 year olds

While Bristol has an active youth council and 16 and 17 year olds across the city hold 
many responsibilities in society, they do not have a chance to influence key decisions 
which will define their future. Extending votes for 16 year olds will provide 16 and 17 
year olds with the chance to be involved in democracy, resulting in even younger 
engagement, and ensure youth issues are represented.

This will follow the precedent set by the Scottish Elections (Reduction of Voting 
Age) Act, May 2016, which allows 16 and 17 year olds to vote in Scottish Parliament 
elections and local government elections. 

In Bristol, this would mean asking for the devolved responsibility to allow 16 and 17 
year olds to vote in local elections.

Community-based 
adaptation

Fair

Communities that are self-organised in day to day life are inherently better prepared 
to respond to, and recover from, unexpected events in their neighbourhoods. 
Community based adaptation (CBA) has been pioneered in developing countries to 
build capacity in vulnerable and marginalised communities to become more resilient 
to climate change impacts. An important lesson from CBA practices is that a multi-
level, cross-sectoral approach involving a range of different stakeholders - including 
the residents themselves - is necessary to develop adaptive capacity and build long 
term resilience.

This action builds on the principles of CBA and experience from a number of 
existing projects and initiatives in Bristol, the south west and other cities around the 
world. It aims to develop a more integrated and inclusive approach to working with 
communities to empower them with the knowledge, confidence and resources to 
take action when affected by local shocks.

Forum, Groundwork (funded by Big Lottery Fund), Bristol Resilience Network, 
Community Development teams, UL Cabinet Office, Voscur

New models of 
housing delivery

Bristol is facing a housing crisis. Yet decent affordable homes are the foundation of a 
successful city. The Mayor has pledged to deliver 2,000 new homes (800 affordable) 
per year by 2020. This will be achieved by setting up a Local Housing Company. This 
Company will have a remit to promote use of brownfield sites across the city for 
housing, work with local communities and support the development of alternative 
housing initiatives such as co-housing and communal living that aim to tackle wider 
social challenges such as social isolation and community cohesion. Affordability will 
be addressed through reduced running costs of sustainable homes.

Delivery

•   Potential partners: Bristol City Council, University of West of England, University 

of Bristol, Registered Social Landlords, Bristol Housing Board, West of England 
authorities, local builders, Community Land Trusts, Bristol and Bath Regional

Learning from elsewhere – Housing for a Resilient New Orleans

To combat new city trends, such as a 50% increase in cost of rental since 2000, Housing for a Resilient New 
Orleans has created an integrated housing framework. This uses the strength of a growing local economy and 
creates a new approach to providing affordable housing choice for residents. 

It creates new policies and tools to address new and long-standing challenges so everyone can participate in 
the city’s growing prosperity. This guided by three core principles: equity, collaboration and openness.

This will support development of new affordable rental and homeownership opportunities, preserve 
affordability, expand access to opportunity using the fair housing principle, and increase accessibility for 
vulnerable populations.

Currently there is free bus travel in Bristol only for children under 5, with half price 
tickets for those ages 5-15. Those aged 16 and under can receive a free bus pass, for 
free school travel from the Council if they go to their nearest school and meet certain 
distance or safety eligibility criteria. Extending this free service to all under 16s on 
all journeys within the city will promote lifelong bus use; reducing congestion and 
enabling children to independently access the facilities and resources of their city. 
Lessons can be learnt from Transport for London who provide this on all on their bus

system. The result was a unique, comprehensive and strategic “Five-year Plan to Increase 
Community Involvement in Portland.” The ongoing implementation of this plan by the City 
of Portland and its community partners is dramatically increasing the scope and quality of 
public involvement and participatory democracy in Portland. 

As part of this, a new Neighbourhood Small Grants program was created. Additional

trees have been planted. The Urban Forest Visual project developed a map of 70,000 of 
the city’s trees. It provides data on the life expectancy, species of tree and the option to 
‘email the tree’. 

The aim was that residents could know more about the city’s trees, their importance and 
email reports to the Council on the state of the trees. Instead, people used this as a chance 
to write love letters to trees. To date, 3000 emails to trees have been received from all

It is vital that the city retains an independent voluntary sector that campaigns for 
social justice and challenges inequalities, whilst at the same time harnessing social 
action and providing services to the city’s most vulnerable people. We recognise 
the value that Bristol’s not for profit sector brings to the city through its capacity for 
innovation and its ability to bring additional resources into the city through charitable 
giving, fundraising, and social enterprise. We will produce a Voluntary Sector Strategy 
to set out how the sector will work with the city to provide services and support 
focused on reducing inequality.

Transformative Leadership

Transformative Leadership is a practical leadership framework that helps individuals 
and organisations adapt and thrive in challenging environments. It describes the 
ability to take on the gradual but meaningful process of change, both individually 
and collectively. The food system, with elements including growing, processing, 
logistics, distribution, selling, buying, cooking and eating, is complex. In order to drive 
change to address the long-term stress of food security and develop more resilient 
approaches, new leadership and skills will be required. The food sector therefore 
provides an excellent sector in which to pilot this approach. This project will develop 
and test approaches to delivering this including U-Theory which has already attracted 
much attention and hundreds of participants in Bristol.

Delivery

•  Potential partners: Bristol City Council, Food Policy Council, Bristol Green Capital 

Partnership. MIT U-Theory (Massive Open On-line Course), Transition Bristol

•  Timescale: Short-term

Resilience value: This aims to train and build skills in adaptive leadership to drive 
collaboration and co-creation. This action will empower citizens, and promote long-

Varied and frequent 
experience of work

The Learning City Partnership Board, supported by the Mayor’s City Office, is leading 
the delivery of more varied and frequent experience of work for all young people 
in the city. The newly created WORKS is the development of a physical and virtual 
‘Engagement Hub’ to bring businesses, education providers and young people 
together. The aim is to provide career related activities and work placements that will 
raise aspirations and secure successful career pathways for all, with an accompanying 
e-portfolio to record young peoples’ experience.  

Many young people do not have the personal networks to gain varied and regular 
experience of the world of work, particularly those who are more vulnerable, such 
as in the care system, and those living in more deprived parts of the city. This lack 
of experience has a direct impact on young peoples’ employability and in turn the 
development of the local workforce.  

A focus on experience of work will galvanize the collective endeavour, building on 
best practice, of the city’s education providers and local employers. Successful local 
programmes, such as HYPE West, will help to ensure those young people furthest 
from the labour market are supported into employment. Digital technology solutions 
to communicate with and engage young people, like Skills Bridge which connects 
university students with the community projects, will be developed in partnership 
with the sector.

The work already done by Bristol-based Happy City Initiative, along with the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provide useful frameworks and tools for 
developing a new, inclusive set of Bristol metrics. These need to be developed and 
agreed with a wide range of city partners so that they can then be used as the basis 
for designing and evaluating future city policies and programmes across different 
organisations and policy areas. They can also be used to raise public awareness and

which to prioritise actions which will ensure the city is on course towards a 
flourishing future. It will also be important for individuals and organisations 
to change and adapt the way they work to meet the fiscal, social and

Integerated

56

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYThese ways of working are not new to the city; as described below there 
are many examples of organisations already piloting or embedding these 
approaches.

The five ways of working are;

1. FOCUSING ON ASSETS

An asset-based approach recognises and builds on the human, social and 
physical capital that exists within local communities. It is a positive way to 
work with people by identifying what they value most and then shaping public 
services that meet real needs. This is in contrast to a deficit model which tends 
to focus on the negative aspects in communities and try to “fix” them.

Asset Based Community Development Approach (ABCD) in Bristol

The Bristol City Council Community Development team has been 
piloting the ABCD approach with some communities in the city and 
there are many stories emerging about how communities are taking 
action to make things happen in their neighbourhoods. One such 
story is Bristol ‘Soup’ in St Pauls. Four Bristol women came together to 
organise the first Bristol ‘Soup’, an idea which came from Detroit in the 
US and there are a few across the UK. As the name suggests it’s a big 
eating (or drinking) of soup! People pay for a bowl of soup (which has 
been donated), local groups pitch to win the money taken on the night 
and the audience votes for the idea they like the most. The first event 
saw 80 people attend at St Pauls Learning Centre and raised £320. Of 
the four pitches the favourite was Bristol West Indian Cricket Club who 
went away with the winnings. They were featured in a programme on 
Made in Bristol TV.

It is a positive way to 
work with people by 
identifying what they 
value most and then 
shaping public services 
that meet real needs. 

57

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY2. MOVING UPSTREAM

There is strong evidence that tackling “upstream” factors in people’s lives 
such as housing, neighbourhood conditions and access to jobs can reduce 
“downstream” disparities in health – particularly among racial and ethnic 
minorities. The principle of moving upstream can applied more broadly to 
thinking about preventing or averting difficulties in people’s lives before 
they become a problem to solve. Bristol has been piloting and developing 
an approach to early intervention in troubled families which have yielded 
impressive results. The principles can be extended to most areas of service 
delivery to ensure that risk factors are identified, and treated holistically by a 
range of professional working together, before they become entrenched and 
costly problems to solve.

Think Family

Bristol’s Think Family programme is achieving life-changing results 
for the city’s troubled families. The council, working in partnership 
with Avon and Somerset Police, has developed an approach to 
identify vulnerable children at risk of sexual exploitation and delivering 
necessary support at an early stage. Underpinning the approach 
is the marriage of a data warehouse containing the records of 
170,000 individuals across 54,000 families and advanced predictive 
analytics most commonly used to predict risk in the finance sector. 
The outcomes are impressive. Adopting this approach, that requires 
professionals to see the problems facing a family as a whole and to 
treat these issues holistically, the team has increased the number of 
families that can be supported from 150 to 1000 per year. There has 
been a 50% reduction in unauthorised school absences, the number 
of police call-outs has halved and there has been a three-quarters 
drop in adults requiring Anti-Social Behaviour intervention. The result 
is an adaptable model that is identifying families at risk of breakdown 
and enabling intervention before issues become entrenched. The 
programme is a beacon of best practice, attracting substantial 
government interest with nearly 50 local authorities already learning 
from it.

Bristol has been 
piloting and 
developing an 
approach to early 
intervention in 
troubled families 
which have yielded 
impressive results. 

58

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY3. CO-CREATING

In the business world, co-creation means involving your customers in 
produce design because it makes good business sense. There is a growing 
recognition that this approach also pays dividends when designing and 
delivering services in the public sector. Creating new solutions with people, 
not for them, can help drive radical innovation. However, this requires a 
culture-shift away from top-down, bureaucratic processes. In Bristol there 
is a real appetite for co-creation and many city partnerships have been 
established to help drive this new way of working. One example is the way 
the new Bristol Impact Fund was developed. The proposed city Office will 
be an important vehicle for encouraging and modelling ways of co-creating 
solutions.

Bristol Impact Fund

Bristol City Council currently invests around £7.7m per year in grants 
to Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) organisations. Historically 
these grants have been delivered through many separate funding 
streams with no single view of how well that funding is working for 
the city as a whole for example in reducing inequalities or improving 
health and wellbeing. The decision was taken to align the grant streams 
through one “Prospectus” in order to focus on priorities and challenges 
and be clear about outcomes. This Prospectus, which was developed 
in partnership with VCS partners led by Voscur, represents an exciting 
and bold step forward in how the Council works with VCS colleagues 
to co-design and co-create a shared view of how to address the needs 
in our city. It also represents a clear commitment to work with the 
expertise and local knowledge of the VCS to shape and deliver the 
right support and services to those most in need of support.

In Bristol there is a 
real appetite for co-
creation and many 
city partnerships have 
been established to 
help drive this new 
way of working. 

59

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY4. DISRUPTING

As discussed previously the idea of “disruption” is central to challenging 
business as usual and unlocking parts of the system that are not currently 
steering us towards a resilient future. The idea may not sit comfortably 
with many people – it’s always easier to work within the status quo – but 
the challenges ahead such as climate change and population growth are 
too big to sleepwalk into the future cling onto the status quo. And anyway, 
disruption will happen whether we like it or not; you only need to look at the 
phenomenal success of Uber or AirBnB to see that change will happen in 
spite of the system. In Bristol we already have a strong culture of disruption 
for social innovation and we can build on this and grow our confidence 
to proactively shape the future city that we want for our children and 
grandchildren.

The Bristol Pound

Bristol’s currency – the Bristol Pound (£B) – was launched in 2012 
as a collaboration between the Bristol Pound Community Interest 
Company, Bristol Credit Union, Bristol City Council, the Transition 
Network, New Economics Foundation and QOIN. The currency, like the 
Brixton Pound and other UK schemes, aims to create local economic 
resilience and greater self-determination by disrupting patterns of 
globalisation and chain-store dominance. Four years on there are more 
than £B1million in circulation in the city and the BPound team are now 
working with some of the 900 businesses enrolled in developing an 
interest-free credit scheme across their supply chains. Some of the 
benefit some of the benfits to the city of using the BPound are:

•  Shortening the supply chain and hence carbon footprint (outlets 

using the BPound have to demonstrate they sources products/
ingredients locally);

•  Building a culture of shopping locally which contributes to 

neighbourhood social cohesion;

•  Reducing shopper’s car trips/car emissions as most BPound shops 

are walking distance in neighbourhoods

In Bristol we already 
have a strong culture 
of disruption for social 
innovation and we 
can build on this and 
grow our confidence 
to proactively shape 
the future city that we 
want for our children 
and grandchildren.

Individuals and institutions that are reflective use past experience to inform 
future decisions, and will modify standards and behaviours accordingly. 
Bristol is already committed to promoting individual learning and in 2015 set 
up the Learning City partnership to: champion learning for all ages and all 
communities; commission activity to increase participation and achievement; 
communicate messages about learning; and celebrate the benefits of 
learning as a way to transform lives. In 2016 Bristol became the first city in 
England to become part of the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities.

Learning from the CRO network

The network of Chief Resilience Officers that 100RC has created a 
unique safe space where cities can share successes and frustrations 
and offer practical advice and examples of best practice to encourage 
and inspire each other. In Bristol we asked the CRO network for 
examples of their climate change adaptation plans. We received 
responses (within less than 48 hours!) from seven major cities 
around the world sharing their plans and experiences of working on 
adapting to climate change. This helped us to benchmark what was 
possible and achievable and be more aspirational and bold in our own 
approach to preparing for climate change.

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGY7. NEXT STEPS

Developing this Strategy has been the first step on the journey towards a 
more resilient and flourishing future. All the stakeholders involved – including 
the Resilience Sounding board – are fully committed to taking this forward to 
implementation. The next steps now are to:

•  Establish ownership – the proposed Mayor’s City Office offers a strong 

place to hold the Strategy and oversee its future implementation;

•  Secure additional resources – the funding from 100RC for Chief Resilience 

Officer ends at the beginning of February 2017;

•  Develop and investment programme to work with 100RCplatform 

partners – there is up to $5million of pro bono city tools and services on 
offer to Bristol and the region which will need to be matched with city 
priorities;

•  Carry on the city conversation and work out how to use this Strategy as a 

living document…it doesn’t end here, this is just the start!

BRISTOL RESILIENCE STRATEGYBristol 2066
Resilience scenarios

May 2016 

Wind-tunneling policy:
The future is likely to contain elements of multiple scenarios 
in a combination that cannot be anticipated. It is therefore 
useful to test current or future policies against a range of 
scenarios to see how effective they are. The objective of 
policy analysis is explore which policies are going to max-
imise the opportunities and mitigate the challenges, and 
which are resilient to the future shocks in each scenario. 

When analysing different options under each scenario, 
it is important that users indicate how a policy or range 
of policies will be implemented in a specific scenario. 
While similar policies may be developed across a range of 
scenarios, the methods of delivery may be quite different. 
Potential interactions with the policy objectives should also 
be explored.

This process is often called wind-tunnelling and it can be 
undertaken in a workshop environment by a policy team or 
a broader mix of stakeholders. The latter generally provides 
better insights and more robust analysis. 

In all cases, care is needed to safeguard against precon-
ceived views on both future context and in relation to 
specific policies.

Context and usages
The purpose of scenario thinking is not to identify the most 
likely future, but to create a map of uncertainty — to ac-
knowledge and examine the visible and hidden forces that 
are driving us toward the unknown future. Scenarios are 
created and used in sets of multiple stories that capture a 
range of possibilities, good and bad, expected and surpris-
ing. They are designed to stretch our thinking about emerg-
ing changes and the opportunities and threats that the 
future might hold. They allow us to weigh our choices more 
carefully when making short-term and long-term strategic 
decisions, and they can help us identify gaps in knowledge 
and priorities for further research.
In order to build a “scenario set”, two orthogonal axes are 
selected that best exploit two key future uncertainties. 
These axes define a matrix of four quadrants, each of which 
represent four contrasting but credible futures. 

Scenarios are a potentially powerful tool for developing and 
testing policies. They can help policy makers develop a 
more nuanced, flexible response to future possibilities, and 
to better anticipate and manage risk in the context of future 
uncertainty. In addition to helping organisations (including 
nation states) make better informed, more robust decisions, 
scenarios can be used to challenge preconceived views of 
the future and associated policies. 

Scenarios can provide a good framework and tool for facil-
itating a strategic discussion on policy options, in meetings 
or in a workshop setting. Where possible, a cross section of 
stakeholders should be engaged in the policy development 
process so that they can contribute to the analysis and 
have shared ownership of the outcomes. Metrics can also 
be used to provide early warning signs of future develop-
ments and directional change.

Bristol 2066
Resilience scenarios

When testing policies against scenarios it is crucial to 
consider:

• 

• 

• 

The relevance of a policy, as it may not be a  
significant issue in a particular scenario 

Their practicality, as the policy may not be effective 
given the conditions in the scenario, or it may not be 
politically or financially deliverable; and 

Their implementation, as it may be that a policy is  
potentially successful across a range of scenarios  
but the way it is presented or implemented in each 
could vary.

Decisions taken should not simply be based on a scoring 
of policies against the scenarios. There may be sound 
reasons why a policy that is contingent on a particular 
scenario should be implemented. In these circumstances 
the analysis can be used to consider how the policy could 
be adapted to make it more robust in other scenarios and 
to consider the associated risks.

Scenarios should not be seen as a mechanical approach 
to achieving the ‘right’ policy. They do not remove future 
uncertainty and there are other complimentary policy tools 
that can be applied.

2066 Narrative: 

Strong political leadership, community cohesion, civic 
responsibility and a sharing economy are credited with 
having maintained relatively high levels of social wellbeing 
in challenging times. Looking forward, it is feared that this 
could be eroded as further climate change unfolds. Despite 
significant investment in technology and low-carbon energy 
solutions, evidence suggests that key tipping points have 
triggered a highly unstable phase of advanced climate 
change. The Bristol city region regularly suffers from 
excessive rainfall and flooding, in addition to occasional 
and protracted heat waves during the summer months as 
temperatures reach 40°C (104°F). Intense periods of drought 

occur every 2-3 years. To date, these events have periodically 
impacted the local economy, on account of disruption to 
business activities and services. Far-sighted mitigation and 
adaptation strategies have helped to limit climate change 
impacts on essential services such as transport, healthcare 
and education. Systems are adaptive and able to learn, 
thereby flexing according to context and circumstances. 
The private sector has part-funded measures to protect the 
local watershed, river basin and catchment areas with the 
Avon Barrier providing energy generation and additional road 
access across the River Avon.

The population has grown 
significantly, as a result 
of inward migration and 
indigenous growth. New 
pressures are expected due 
to further population growth 
– on housing, transport, 
health and education in 
particular. Bristol is piloting 
a range of educational and 
vocational programmes 
aimed at nurturing a new 
generation of work-ready 
youths. Multi-culturalism is 
thriving and a wide cross-
section of Bristol society 
actively participates in 
political and cultural life.  

Green and blue infrastructure 
helps to protect Bristolians 
from severe flooding 
and drought. Adaptation 
measures are providing 
important socio-economic 
returns. Bristol has learnt to 
cope with excessive rainfall. 
A new wetland area, the 
West of England Estuary, 
has proved successful in 
mitigating flood impacts 
while acting as a year-round 
wildfowl and wetlands centre. 
Sea level rise has been 
negligible to date. However 
there are concerns that this 
may scale dramatically.

With the election of the first 
city region mayor in 2019, 
significant decision making 
powers have devolved to the 
local level. However, climate 
change and energy remain 
under central Government 
control. The Local Resilience 
Forum (LRF) brings together 
the police and other 
emergency responders.

Bristol society places great 
value on green space, nature 
and ecosystem services. 
There is a closer relationship 
between rural hinterlands 
and cities in relation to 
food, energy and water. The 
extensive water park along 
the Gorge breathes new life 
into the area and makes the 
most of this impressive asset 
at the heart of the city region. 
A diverse mix of housing 
types and tenures ensures 
that homes are affordable.

2066 Narrative: 

Global efforts have failed to curtail carbon emissions and 
the world is now experiencing run away climate change. A 
third of all species are at high risk of extinction and marine 
food chains have collapsed. GM food is accepted as a much 
needed technology response. Successive changes in UK 
government policy have resulted in mismanagement of the 
associated risks. Extreme weather events cause persistent 
disruption, knocking out critical infrastructure with increasing 
regularity in Bristol. Communications are occasionally 
interrupted by blackouts and brownouts, and periodic floods 
and heat waves wreak havoc in terms of transport, energy, 
housing and access to services. Sea levels are beginning 
to impinge on waterfront property, forcing adaptation or 
demolition. The NHS has collapsed as climate change has 

brought new, more virulent strains of virus to the UK. Multi-
cultural society has become fragmented, and a dominant 
underclass has emerged. Communities cluster together, 
some trapped in dense high-rises while others take to living 
in makeshift flotillas and squatting in Colston Tower and 
other abandoned properties. Farming collectives patrol and 
protect crops. Deforestation is rampant as fuel is becoming 
increasingly scarce. The affluent minority has moved 
overseas, or to fortress communities in the countryside. A 
wealthy enclave remains in Clifton on high ground. Areas 
of Clifton Downs are being used for food production so the 
wealthier have access to local produce. Private security is a 
lucrative business and cyber-crime is rampant.

The population has swelled 
and social tensions run 
high. Communities are 
fragmented and xenophobia 
is on the rise. Informal 
Settlements have formed in 
St Pauls and many historians 
have commented on the 
similarities with the riots 
back in 1980. The young and 
elderly are most vulnerable 
to climate change impacts. 
Public disorder and crime is 
rife. Clifton community have 
turned their back on the city 
and face outwards, towards 
the rural, food growing 
hinterland.

Bristol city becomes 
increasingly dense with the 
population reaching half a 
million residents by mid-
2025. Heat waves are felt 
even more keenly in the 
city and green and blue 
infrastructure fails to contain 
the effects of extreme 
weather. The Cumberland 
basin is completely 
submerged and The Portway 
is no longer accessible. 
Widespread deforestation 
has gradually denuded Leigh 
Woods and Blaise Castle 
Estate.

GDP is still used as a metric 
to measure economic activity 
and success in the UK, but 
it is one which shows Bristol 
to be failing dramatically, 
along with many other cities 
worldwide. Unemployment 
is at its highest rate for 
decades. 

Decision making in the UK is 
even more centralised with 
even less ability for local 
areas to make decisions in 
their locality. Thousands of 
grassroots organisations 
have formed in the city, 
many of which have adopted 
an anarchy philosophy. 
Municipal services are 
reduced due to lack of funds, 
causing progressive urban 
decay.

An international coalition, of which the UK is a part, is losing 
a protracted war on terror. There is a much-feared CBRN 
threat (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear), although 
this has only manifested overseas to date. While occasional 
extreme weather continues to impact the UK, it is thought 
that climate change has been largely contained to within 
2 degrees. Across the UK, lifestyles are determined by a 
strict and enforced scheme of carbon consumption control, 
imposed by UK central government and overseen by a 
Carbon Commissar. As with many other woodlands across 
the UK, access to Leigh Woods has been prohibited in order 
to safeguard its carbon sequestration function. Rail and 
bus services have been re-nationalised. External costs are 

internalized and “priced in” to goods and services. This has 
contributed to a relatively high cost of living. Horizons and 
mobility have shrunk to the extent that people live a more 
local and community-focused lifestyle. The government 
continues to promote the development of green and 
innovative technology. However, it is often accused of having 
favoured the wrong solutions. Smart grids and intelligent 
transport systems are shown to be vulnerable to hacking. 
Wider cyber-criminal activity has resulted in increased theft, 
extortion and blackmail. Fear and insecurity has become rife, 
linked to the digital lifestyles that have been taken for granted 
for so long, particularly as Bristol was a pioneer in integrating 
digital technologies into the City’s operations.

Inflation has led to an 
increased cost of living. 
Imported goods are also 
expensive. Many basic 
consumer needs are met 
by local Bristol businesses 
and producers, all of 
which are burdened by 
enforced carbon accounting 
requirements and labelling.
Some people have 
good relationships with 
neighbours, but others are 
increasingly socially isolated.

Public transport systems, 
comprising light rail and 
trams, have been established 
in Bristol. Car use is severely 
limited due to carbon 
consumption controls 
and measures. The M32 
becomes the first Personal 
Rapid Transit (PRT) Highway 
route in the city.
The city is more self-
contained, but with digital 
technologies creating 
connections elsewhere.

Local authorities have very 
little power or funding. 
Historians have remarked 
that they now perform a 
similar role to that of parish 
councils in the early 21st 
Century.
Power largely remains in the 
hands of central government.
Bristol city region is the first 
to approve a 4-day working 
week as normal practice.

The aerospace industry 
in Bristol has collapsed, 
bringing about a significant 
loss of local jobs. As a result, 
there is a huge shift towards 
local service and “maker” 
jobs, such as crafts and 
artisan food production.

Most global governments are successfully delivering against 
their carbon emissions reduction targets. It is widely thought 
that climate change has been successfully contained to 
within 1.5 degrees. A Well-Being Index is used in political 
decision making in Bristol and many other devolved areas 
of the UK. The Circular City initiative, adopted by several 
UK cities, has led to a step-change increase in resource 
efficiency. Bath has been recognised for its excellence in 
resource hyper-efficiency and has become a leading example 
globally. Urban hubs such as Southmead, Hengrove and 
Thornbury have become increasingly restructured around 
localized services that support and promote zero waste. 
Producers are required by international law to design goods 
for disassembly and reuse globally. There has been an 
accelerated effort to construct net-zero homes in Bristol’s 

rural areas and on brownfield sites, and a marked increase 
in regional food production in recent years. North Somerset 
has pioneered quality green housing in the UK. Smart 
metering is used across all domestic and commercial asset 
types, helping manage demand for energy and water. A 
wide range of local businesses offer high quality jobs. Over 
500,000 new jobs have been generated as a result of the 
Vision for Sustainable Growth. Social equality has become an 
important political objective, and Bristol has benefitted from 
a more equitable distribution of wealth. The elected mayor 
of the Bristol city region has greater fiscal control and has 
increased taxes to pay for carbon reduction measures. Crime 
is at a record low. Bristol’s society is ethically diverse, close-
knit and supportive.
