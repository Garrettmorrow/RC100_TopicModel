VISION FOR A RESILIENT 

PITTSBURGH

Pittsburgh will be a resilient city when the entire community 
shares  the  same  opportunities  for  prosperity,  and  when  all 
residents are well cared for and prepared to face potential risks 
and adversities. The Pittsburgh resilience strategy establishes 
a bold vision for the city, building on the successes in recent 
decades  and  a  wealth  of  community  assets,  while  directly 
confronting the complex challenges that the city continues to 
face. 

is  a  holistic  approach 

Resilience 
to  urban  systems 
management  that  demonstrates  interrelationships  between 
sectors.  The  resilience  strategy  is  intended  as  a  guide  for 
city  plans  and  initiatives  to  achieve  maximum  community 
impact by addressing the root causes of systemic challenges. 
The strategy will help Pittsburgh realize the central purpose 
of a thriving city in the 21st century: to create conditions in 
which every resident can flourish in the face of challenges and 
every community can effectively respond and recover in any 
circumstance. 
 
By fostering a regional atmosphere of collaborative problem 
solving  and  resource  coordination,  the  strategy  will  build 
on  collective  efforts  and  establish  a  guide  for  activities  that 
need coordination, acceleration, amplification and initiation. 
Pittsburgh will thrive in the 21st century as a city of engaged, 
empowered and coordinated neighbors.

Citizens of Pittsburgh,

Resilience is a journey. Cities recognize this statement better than most. Cities exist at the center of the ebb and flow of 
human progress, and as such have the ability to encourage innovation and great societal benefit. Along our journeys, cities 
confront the inevitable challenges that disrupt our thoughtful, predetermined courses and have the ability to respond to 
opportunities that seemingly arise out of nowhere. It is important to recognize that both opportunities and disruptions offer 
the greatest occasion for administrators and elected officials to capitalize, create benefit and chart new and positive trajecto-
ries for their communities.

For Pittsburgh, the current chapter of our resilience journey begins with the acknowledgment of our recent past. A reverence 
to our scars, it is within our history that we find lessons from which we can learn, and set a course that allows us to improve 
and drive towards a stronger, albeit uncertain future.

The City of Pittsburgh and our residents are familiar with the resilience journey. Pittsburgh’s history is filled with the peaks 
of success and the valleys of disappointment. The picture of Pittsburgh is a checkered range marked with impairments such 
as air and water pollution, labor and racial unrest and economic boom and bust; alongside numerous industrial innovations, 
advances in science and education and a rich cultural tradition. It is with this recognition of our past that we look forward 
towards our future. It is this understanding of history that is at the root of our partnership with 100 Resilient Cities, and why 
we have taken on the challenge of creating Pittsburgh’s first resilience strategy.

Today, Pittsburgh finds itself in a pivotal moment in history. The challenges of globalization, our ever changing environment, 
and urbanization - once the causes of many of the City’s shocks and stresses, are now initiating a shift for the City; from 
managing population and economic decline to encouraging us to manage growth and prosperity. Amid a time of positive 
momentum, we recognize that now is the perfect moment in time to chart the course for Pittsburgh’s next generation. All 
Pittsburghers have not benefited from the current momentum, and with this in mind, let me state that a resilient community 
must be one that provides inclusive, sustainable and welcoming opportunities for all its residents.

Building resilience is a process. Its requires recognition of our challenges, and the ability to heal physical and mental wounds, 
to create adaptive policies, and to restructure investment decisions. To lead this process, our strategy is built with the belief 
that with the right tools, the ability to empower our people, and the acknowledgment that the City of Pittsburgh will continu-
ously improve - we will all come together as neighbors to find solutions to our common problems.

We recognize that one of the shortcomings in our past was that we walked separately, along differing paths. Today, we have 
the opportunity to walk with intent and purpose as a community towards a brighter future. We, the City government, are 
at the helm of this plan - but we are not at the center. AT the core of this strategy are the residents, the people of the City of 
Pittsburgh.

Today, together, we move forward as one Pittsburgh.

Sincerely,

William Peduto
Mayor, City of Pittsburgh

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYDear Pittsburgh,

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to congratulate the City of Pittsburgh on the release of ONE PGH: 
Pittsburgh’s Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for the city and for our partnership. ONE PGH lays out an exemplary vision 
of urban resilience for the city’s residents, neighborhoods, and the region. As the city’s post-industrial resurgence continues, 
this Resilience Strategy provides a comprehensive path toward realizing a vision of an inclusive and innovative city where “if 
it’s not for all, it’s not for us.” 

The Steel City’s success is proof that post-industrial demise is not a permanent condition. After capturing the world’s imagination 
in the late 19th and first half of the 20th century – in 1911, the city was producing half of all American steel -- the city devolved 
into a cautionary tale, with steel mills and related industries shuttering, and the effects of heavy industry taking their toll on the 
environment. Along with its industrial base, the immense amount of resources that the Fricks, Carnegies, and Mellons invested 
to create world class educational and cultural institutions also faded. But after losing 40% of its population between 1970 and 
2006, Pittsburgh is growing again, this time at the forefront of a rustbelt revival that is anchored in a broad variety of   new 
industries spanning technology, finance, higher education, and advanced manufacturing. But, as this strategy acknowledges, 
not all in Pittsburgh have felt this rebirth equally. 

The actions outlined within ONE PGH will strengthen Pittsburgh not just in the face of the sudden shocks that will confront cities 
throughout the 21st Century, but also the chronic stresses that challenge the city over the longer term, and that exacerbate the 
effects of those shocks when they do occur. That is the power of resilience solutions: single interventions designed to achieve 
multiple benefits. 

The support of City leadership has been critical toward the formation of this Strategy. Mayor Bill Peduto has helped promote 
resilience as a cornerstone for collaborative action across the city and region, in both the public and private sectors, and has 
championed the message of an open, resurgent, and globally connected Pittsburgh throughout our network. We thank the 
Mayor and his team for their commitment.  With Strategy Partner RAND, and their valuable expertise, the Resilient Pittsburgh 
team has led a robust, community-driven process that reached far and wide, reflecting the full spectrum of Pittsburgh’s voices 
and concerns.

As  our  partnership  moves  into  implementation,  it  does  so  with  a  major  advantage  –  the  city’s  groundbreaking  planning 
initiative, p4 Pittsburgh. Launched in 2015, p4 provides a framework for unified action across the city to achieve a just and 
sustainable future. Its ethos of collaboration and communal reach will deepen the impact of the Strategy, and contribute to the 
shared goal of a “world class city that benefits all.” 

Pittsburgh has already shown its ability to recover and adapt to the new challenges of the 21st Century and we are excited for 
the continued course of resilience this Strategy charts.

Congratulations again on this enormous achievement, and we look forward to our continued partnership in the journey ahead.

Michael Berkowitz
President, 100 Resilient Cities

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYCITY CONTEXT

The  City  of  Pittsburgh  celebrated  its  200th  anniversary 
in  2016  as  a  city  on  the  rise.  The  grit  and  ingenuity  of 
generations  of  Pittsburghers  has  helped  the  city  rebound 
after fires, floods, and the collapse of the steel industry in the 
mid-20th century. After losing 40 percent of its population 
between  1970  and  2006,  Pittsburgh  is  growing  again. The 
number  of  millennials  and  recent  college  graduates  in 
the city, for example, went up by more than eight percent 
over the past decade. Today, Pittsburgh faces lower natural 
disaster risk and is less exposed to another economic shock 
than many other cities due to its location, natural resources, 
and diversified economy. Investments in higher education, 
workforce  retraining,  startups  and  small  businesses,  and 
the redevelopment and remediation of a thousand acres of 
former industrial sites have drawn attention to Pittsburgh as 
one of America’s most livable cities. 

WHY A RESILIENCE STRATEGY FOR PITTSBURGH?

Despite its well-publicized recent successes, the “Steel City” 
must still overcome the stresses associated with its industrial 
infrastructure,  while  responding 
legacy  and  crumbling 
to  ongoing  pressures  stemming 
from  urbanization, 
globalization, and climate change. Persistent socioeconomic 
inequities, coupled with a history of fragmented governance, 
planning and service delivery, continue to undercut resident 
quality of life and strain city resources. 

Public,  private,  and  non-profit  organizations  have  made 
significant investments in building a more livable Pittsburgh, 
cleaning  up  the  city’s  industrial  legacy,  and  creating  new 
economic  and  residential  opportunities.  A  number  of 
strategic  initiatives  have  been  initiated  in  recent  years 
to  address  resilience-related  goals, 
including  p4,  the 
Roadmap  for  Inclusive  Innovation,  Welcoming  Pittsburgh, 
a  Climate  Action  Plan,  My  Brother’s  Keeper,  a  Threat  and 
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment, and the Western 
Pennsylvania  Regional  Data  Center 
(WPRDC).  These 
collective efforts are helping to transform the city’s narrative 
from  a  story  of  loss  and  decline  to  one  of  resilience  and 
opportunity, but have not yet been aligned or coordinated 
to  ensure  successful  implementation  or  improved  and 
sustainable outcomes for residents’ wellbeing. This strategy 

10

will  strengthen  collaborations  and  support  the  integration 
of  the  practice  of  urban  resilience  among  the  people  and 
the institutions of the city. It will afford long-term benefits 
by ensuring: 

• 

• 
• 

• 

Improved  coordination  among  government  and 
non-government organizations
Better budgeting and capital coordination city-wide
Adoption  of  resilience  practices  in  government, 
institutions, organizations, neighborhoods, etc.
Increased resident engagement and empowerment

The  present  time  represents  an  important  crossroads  for 
the  city.  Pittsburgh  seeks  to  capitalize  on  its  recovery  with 
sustainable  growth,  but  needs  to  avoid  repeating  the 
mistakes of the past. The way forward demands thoughtful 
planning, close coordination, and integration between and 
among  government  and  nongovernmental  partners  to 
ensure  that  the  city  grows  equitably  and  sustainably.  The 
city also must recognize the needs and value of its long-term 
residents while welcoming and supporting newcomers. 

Capitalizing  on  Pittsburgh’s  assets—its  universities;  wealth 
of  parks,  rivers,  and  streams;  robust  philanthropic  sector; 
highly  collaborative  spirit;  new  economic  drivers;  visionary 
and  capable  non-profits;  and  resident  enthusiasm  and 
activity—Resilient  Pittsburgh  and  its  partners  developed  a 
comprehensive strategy to address these opportunities and 
challenges. Pittsburgh applied and was selected to become 
one  of  100  Resilient  Cities–  Pioneered  by  the  Rockefeller 
Foundation  (100RC)  in  December  2014.  100RC  helps  cities 
around  the  world  become  more  resilient  to  the  physical, 
social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of 
the  21st  century.  100RC  defines  resilience  as  the  capacity 
of  individuals,  communities,  institutions,  businesses,  and 
systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter 
what  kinds  of  chronic  stresses  and  acute  shocks  they 
experience. 

HOW THE STRATEGY WAS DEVELOPED

The  100RC  City  Resilience  Strategy  process  includes  three 
phases.  Phase  1  involved  stakeholder  engagement  and 
data  collection  activities  to  understand  the  current  state 
of  the  city’s  resilience,  resulting  in  a  Preliminary  Resilience 
Assessment. Phase 2 entailed in-depth research on themes 

identified  in  Phase  1,  additional  stakeholder  engagement; 
brainstorming  of  the  goals,  objectives,  and  actions  that 
comprise  the  resilience  framework;  and  prioritization  and 
synthesis work, culminating in this resilience strategy. Phase 
3,  implementation,  will  follow  release  of  the  strategy. This 
process was led by the Resilient Pittsburgh team, comprised 
of  the  city’s  Chief  Resilience  Officer  (CRO)  Grant  Ervin  and 
the City Resilience team in the Division of Sustainability and 
Resilience, the RAND Corporation as a strategy partner, and 
100RC as the funder and collaborator. It has also involved the 
contributions of over 600 Pittsburghers since June 2015.

about affordability and gentrification have also emerged as 
the city redevelops, and an aging population and workforce 
continue  to  threaten  the  economic  stability  of  the  region. 
Simultaneously, fragmentation of effort among non-profits 
and  local  governments  in  the  region  hinders  efforts  to 
address  these  challenges.  Moreover,  acute  shocks,  some 
predicted  to  become  more  likely  as  a  result  of  climate 
change,  pose  threats  to  the  city.  Potential  future  shocks 
include extreme weather, flooding, landslides, and extreme 
temperatures,  among  other  concerns  identified  during 
strategy development.

This  document  describes  Pittsburgh’s  resilience  strategy. 
The  strategy  is  intended  to  acknowledge  and  address  the 
city’s  recent  challenges  and  trends  pro-actively,  applying 
lessons  from  the  past  and  from  other  partnering  cities 
to  forge  a  stronger  future  for  the  city  and  region.  Because 
the  city  of  Pittsburgh  is  the  beneficiary  of  funding  from 
100RC,  the  strategy  will  often  refer  to “Pittsburgh”  or “the 
city”  in  a  leadership  capacity.  However,  the  vision  of  a 
resilient  Pittsburgh  extends  beyond  the  city  borders,  and 
recommendations  in  this  strategy  aim  to  help  the  entire 
Pittsburgh  metropolitan  region  move  toward  a  model  of 
greater  collaboration  in  order  to  support  planning  and 
convey benefits to the region more broadly.

PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES

The  threats  to  Pittsburgh’s  resilience  form  a  constellation 
of  risks,  including  both  chronic  stresses—long-term,  slow 
burning issues that overwhelm the capacity of city resources 
and erode resident wellbeing—and potential acute shocks—
sudden,  large-scale  disasters  that  disrupt  city  services  and 
threaten residents from extreme weather.  

While the city’s inland geography protects its residents from 
many of the natural hazards that are expected to occur more 
frequently  in  coastal  regions,  the  city’s  endemic  stresses 
disproportionately  affect  some  of 
its  most  vulnerable

Specifically,  Pittsburgh  faces  significant  challenges  with

The Pittsburgh resilience strategy consists of a holistic set of goals, objectives, and actions that tackle some of the region’s 
major resilience challenges and help the city build the capacity to successfully confront future threats. The goals of Pittsburgh 
resilience framework purposefully align with the four “p”s of the p4 framework, already adopted by partners across the city 
to  inspire  innovative,  sustainable,  and  inclusive  action. The  resilience  framework  then  builds  upon  p4  to  create  a  holistic, 
community-centered  approach  and  to  describe  the  specific  ways  in  which  different  sectors  will  work  collectively  to  make 
Pittsburgh a resilient city in terms of its People, Place, Planet, and Performance.

PEOPLE
Pittsburgh will empower all residents to contribute to thriving and supportive communities by ensuring that basic 
needs are met. We will be an inclusive city of innovation that celebrates our diversity, and all residents will have 
equal access to resources and opportunity

PLACE
Pittsburgh  will  use  land  to  benefit  all  residents;  to  increase  social  cohesion,  connectivity,  public  and  ecological 
health; and to protect against current and future risks. We will design, scale, and maintain our infrastructure for 
current and future needs, providing benefits and services to our neighborhoods during times of calm and crisis
PLANET
Pittsburgh will achieve long-term environmental health through wise stewardship, improved use of our resources, 
and a reduced carbon footprint

PERFORMANCE
Pittsburgh will work closely with neighbors and partners for improved planning and decision-making

Each of these four goals is supported 
by  a 
sector-specific 
objective.  While  each  objective 
typically focuses on a specific topic 
area within each goal, the objectives 
are  also  designed  to  work  across 
stresses  and  shocks  to  produce 
a  “resilience  dividend”  –  that 
is, 
multiple benefits for resilience from 
a single activity. 

This strategy identifies both existing 
and new actions related to resilience, 
connects  these  actions  to  relevant 
resilience goals and objectives, and 
identifies  next  steps  to  ensure  that 
these  actions  can  be  implemented 
successfully

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYSTRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION

The  Pittsburgh  resilience  strategy  requires  a  comprehensive  implementation  plan  to  support  uptake, 
integration,  and  long-term  sustainability.  The  Division  of  Sustainability  and  Resilience,  as  a  part  of  the 
Department of City Planning in collaboration with the Mayor’s Office, will serve as the lead office for strategy 
implementation and will support a series of implementation steps through the next year to facilitate the 
effective rollout and adoption of the strategy across sectors and stakeholders. The immediate next steps for 
strategy implementation in year one include: 

1.  Convene action leadership groups
2.  Establish a governance and institutionalization framework
3.  Establish a measurement framework
4. 

Integrate resilience-building into civic engagement and public events. 

The new and existing actions featured in this strategy are the activities to be implemented in order for 
Pittsburgh  to  achieve  its  resilience  goals  and  objectives.  Addressing  the  goals  of  Pittsburgh’s  resilience 
strategy requires not only the initiation of some new actions, but also better coordination, amplification, 
and acceleration of promising existing government and nongovernmental activities and initiatives to create 
a resilient and livable city of innovation for all. Figure 2 shows an example of how existing and new activities 
fall along a taxonomy of implementation.

Figure 2. Taxonomy for implementing resilience actions with select examples

 Additional efforts are needed to support implementation over the long term. These include coordination 
among  government  and  nongovernmental  sectors,  resource  allocation  and  a  cohesive  investment 
framework,  community  awareness  and  ongoing  education,  and  targeted  partner  building.  Ongoing 
measurement and regular analysis and use of the data collected will also be central to implementation.

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYINTRODUCTION

The  City  of  Pittsburgh  celebrated  its  200th  anniversary  in 
2016. The grit and ingenuity of generations of Pittsburghers 
has helped the city rebound after fires, floods, and the collapse 
of the steel industry in the mid-20th century. After losing 40 
percent of its population between 1970 and 2006, Pittsburgh 
is  growing  again.  Today,  Pittsburgh  faces  lower  natural 
disaster risk and is less exposed to another economic shock 
than many other cities due to its location, natural resources, 
and diversified economy. Investments in higher education, 
workforce  retraining,  startups  and  small  businesses,  and 
the redevelopment and remediation of a thousand acres of 
former  industrial  sites  have  drawn  attention  to  Pittsburgh 
as one of America’s most livable cities. The city is home to 
378  Leadership  in  Energy  &  Environmental  Design  (LEED) 
certified  projects  and  two  “living  buildings.”4  Pittsburgh 
was named the number one food city in America by Zagat 
in 2015, and 2,800 new hotel rooms have been added in the 
city since 2011.5

its 

industrial 

However,  the “Steel  City”  must  still  overcome  the  stresses 
associated  with 
legacy  and  crumbling 
infrastructure  while  responding  to  ongoing  pressures 
stemming  from  the  global  mega-trends  of  urbanization, 
globalization, and climate change. Persistent socioeconomic 
inequities, coupled with a history of fragmented governance, 
planning and service delivery, continue to undercut resident 
quality of life and strain city resources. 

To  build  upon  the  city’s  strengths  and  to  improve  its 
resilience,  Pittsburgh  applied  and  was  selected  to  become 
one  of  100  Resilient  Cities–  Pioneered  by  the  Rockefeller 
Foundation  (100RC)  in  December  2014.  100RC  helps  cities 
around  the  world  become  more  resilient  to  the  physical, 
social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of 
the  21st  century.  100RC  defines  resilience  as  the  capacity 
of  individuals,  communities,  institutions,  businesses,  and 
systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter 
what  kinds  of  chronic  stresses  and  acute  shocks  they 
experience. 

Becoming  part  of  100RC  has  provided  Pittsburgh  with 
funding  for  a  Chief  Resilience  Officer  (CRO)  to 
lead 
resilience  efforts  and  a  team  to  support  him  (Resilient 
Pittsburgh); resources for developing this resilience strategy;

membership in a global partnership network of peer cities to 
share lessons learned; and access to a city solutions network, 
which provides member cities with access to a curated suite 
of resilience-building tools and services. The 100RC network 
also allows the city to share Pittsburgh’s story and learn from 
the  community  of  cities  around  the  world.  The  Resilient 
Pittsburgh  team  sees  this  as  an  important  opportunity  to 
harness  community  energy  and  realize  the  potential  of 
Pittsburgh’s residents and institutions to create positive and 
lasting long-term change. 

PURPOSE OF THE STRATEGY

Pittsburgh  has  already  demonstrated  marked  resilience  in 
recent  decades  after  recovering  from  the  steel  industry’s 
collapse. But this story remains unfinished: the city’s livability 
and  affordability  are  not  broadly  shared  among  residents, 
and  ongoing  stresses  and  acute  shocks  continue  to  strain 
city resources. In 2016, for example, the city suffered a series 
of  new  shocks.  In  August,  flash  flooding  put  Washington 
Boulevard, a main thoroughfare in the city’s East End where 
flooding became fatal in 2014, underwater again.  Routine 
maintenance caused a fire which closed the Liberty Bridge, 
a critical transportation link between the City of Pittsburgh 
and the South Hills suburbs, for multiple weeks in September. 
Consumer alerts from PWSA in the summer of 2016 exposed 
elevated  lead  levels  in  Pittsburgh’s  drinking  water.  These 
events put a spotlight on the continued challenges the city 
faces. 

The resilience strategy serves as a blueprint to better prepare 
the city for these kinds of inevitable challenges. It is intended 
to help Pittsburghers work together to address the deeply 
rooted  structural,  social,  economic,  and  environmental 
stresses  that  threaten  the  progress  of  the  city  and  its 
residents.  This  strategy  will  strengthen  collaborations  and 
support  the  integration  of  the  practice  of  urban  resilience 
among  the  people  and  the  institutions  of  the  city.  It  will 
afford long-term benefits by ensuring: 

• 

Improved  coordination  among  government  and 
non-government organizations
• 
Better budgeting and capital coordination city-wide
•  Adoption  of  resilience  practices  in  government, 

institutions, organizations, neighborhoods, etc.
Increased resident engagement and empowerment

• 

City  resilience  is  the  capacity 

of 

individuals,  communities, 

institutions,  businesses,  and 

systems  within  a 

city 

to 

survive,  adapt,  and  grow  no 

matter  what  kinds  of  chronic 

stresses and acute shocks they 

experience.

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYThe  resilience  strategy  describes  a  high-level  framework 
to  understand  resilience  in  Pittsburgh,  relates  existing  and 
new  programs  and  investments  to  this  framework,  and 
provides  a  pathway  to  evaluating  the  long-term  resilience 
value of government and nongovernmental actions. It is also 
intended to serve as an “investment prospectus” for the city 
by  showing  where  gaps  exist  and  where  new  investment 
could  yield  the  greatest  benefits  and  co-benefits  for  all

PITTSBURGH’S CITY CONTEXT

Figure 4. Topographic map of Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh  is  a  mid-sized  American  city  with  a  current 
population  of  just  over  300,0006  and  is  the  principal  city 
of  Allegheny  County,  Pennsylvania,  which  is  home  to  over 
1.2 million residents.7 The broader ten-county metropolitan 
region  includes  2.57  million  residents,  making  it  the  22nd 
largest metropolitan area in the United States.7,8 

DEEP CONNECTION TO NEIGHBORHOOD & PLACE

Pittsburgh’s 90 unique neighborhoods are places that people 
care  about.  Pittsburghers  have  a  strong  sense  of  identity 
within  the  neighborhoods  where  they  live  now  or  where 
they  grew  up. This  connection  is  not  limited  to  a  physical 
place,  but  includes  a  shared  emotional  connection  with 
the people and experiences created in that neighborhood. 
Within these neighborhoods, a community ethos is born, a 
sense of pride and a willingness to collaborate that is shared 
from generation to generation.

is  defined  by  hills,  waterways, 
Pittsburgh’s  geography 
and  bridges  (Figure  4). The  city  is  famously  located  at  the 
confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers (and 
their tributaries), which converge just outside of downtown 
to  form  the  Ohio  River.  Over  2,000  miles  of  streams  and 
90  miles  of  rivers  flow  through  Allegheny  County  (Figure 
5).15  Transportation  routes  generally  follow  the  paths  of 
rivers and streams, but the city is also home to some of the 
steepest  streets  and  roads  in  the  country,  which  connect 
different communities. These features contribute to a unique 
and beautiful cityscape but also divide the city into isolated

suburban flight, which all led to the out-migration of much 
of the population. By 2000, the city’s population had halved 
along with its tax base, while the amount of infrastructure 
requiring maintenance remained the same. 

As  the  population  shrank,  the  City  struggled  to  maintain 
quality  of  life  for  its  residents.  In  the  1990s,  the  City  and 
County formed the Regional Asset District, a 1% county-wide 
sales  tax  to  fund  cultural  institutions,  recreational  facilities 
and  libraries.  City  government-owned  assets  such  as  the 
National  Aviary,  Phipps  Conservatory  and  the  Pittsburgh 
Zoo  and  Aquarium  then  became  nonprofit  organizations 
that  received  RAD  funding  18.  During  this  time,  Pittsburgh 
Water and Sewer Authority was formed for bonding capacity. 
In 2003, the City laid off 446 full and part time employees,

The  decentralization  of 
assets  and  lack  of  capacity 
for  service  delivery  at  the 
city  government  led  to  the  rise  of  philanthropy  and  the 
nonprofit sector to fill the voids and maintain quality of life 
for Pittsburghers. Today, as the City government rebounds, 
fragmentation  between  organizations  and  government 
challenges  the  efficiency  of  providing  services  to  city 
residents, while years of deferred maintenance of the city’s 
oversized infrastructure is emerging from a major stress into 
a cascade of shocks.

The  city’s  and  the  region’s  populations  have  both  skewed 
older in recent decades. The proportion of elderly residents 
(age  65  and  older)  in  Allegheny  County  was  16.7  percent 
in  2010,  compared  with  13  percent  for  the  nation  as  a 
whole.12 This proportion is projected to grow to 21 percent 
by 2040, mirroring national demographic trends.12 However, 
Pittsburgh is also experiencing a resurgence of young people 
moving to the city or remaining after graduating from one 
of its colleges and universities: In the past decade, there has 
been a 29-percent increase in young graduates choosing to 
remain in the city.13

The steel and industrial boom produced investments in the 
city’s  physical  infrastructure  and  educational  and  cultural 
institutions,  led  by  industrialists  and  financiers  such  as 
Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, and Henry Clay Frick who 
built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. While heavy industry, coal 
mining,  and  steel  production  provided  jobs,  prominence, 
and  money  to  the  region,  they  also  took  a  toll  on  city 
residents  and  the  natural  environment,  leading  to  severe 
air  and  water  pollution,  acid  mine  drainage,  and  polluted 
soils. By the 1940s, Pittsburgh was critical in producing steel, 
ammunition and battleships for the war effort. 

Pittsburgh’s post WWII peak was followed by major economic 
changes,  including  the  collapse  of  the  domestic  steel 
industry in the 1970s and 80s, the recession of 1982-83, and

At  the  same  time,  however,  rising  housing  prices 
Pittsburgh’s  traditionally  mixed-income  neighborhoods, 
concerns  that  the  new  tech-based  economic  growth  may 
not  provide  broad-based  opportunities,  and  a  recognition 
that  Pittsburgh’s  close  neighbors  (its  inner-ring  suburbs) 
have  largely  not  rebounded  from  the  collapse  of  the  steel 
industry  have  raised  questions  about  who  is  benefiting 
from  Pittsburgh’s  transformation.  Recent  analyses  ranked 
Pittsburgh  in  the  bottom  quarter  of  the  top  100  regions 
nationwide 
in  terms  of  progress  on  racial  economic 
inclusion,  as  defined  by  racial  gaps  in  wages,  poverty,  and 
employment.21

Upgrades  and  maintenance  of  the  city’s  infrastructure  and 
some of its institutions have also not been keeping pace with 
the rapidly changing environment.22 Moreover, local venture 
capital investment will not fully meet the needs of growth-
stage companies started in the city, and many of the city’s 
most  successful  knowledge-based  companies  have  sought 
support from outside of the city to grow their businesses.23 

The  present  time  represents  an  important  crossroads  for 
the  city.  Pittsburgh  seeks  to  capitalize  on  its  recovery  with 
sustainable  growth,  but  needs  to  avoid  repeating  the 
mistakes of the past. The way forward demands thoughtful 
planning, close coordination, and integration between and 
among  government  and  nongovernmental  partners  to 
ensure  that  the  city  grows  equitably  and  sustainably.  The 
city also must recognize the needs and value of its long-term 
residents  while  welcoming  and  supporting  newcomers.  A 
number of strategic initiatives have been initiated in recent 
years  to  address  resilience-related  goals  (Figure  8).  These 
include,  for  example,  changes  to  city  operations,  p4,  the 
Roadmap  for  Inclusive  Innovation,  Welcoming  Pittsburgh, 
a  Climate  Action  Plan,  My  Brother’s  Keeper,  the  City’s 
Comprehensive Plan, a Threat and Hazard Identification and

Data Center (WPRDC). These collective efforts are helping to 
transform the city’s narrative from a story of loss and decline 
to one of resilience and opportunity but have not yet been 
aligned or coordinated to ensure successful implementation 
or 
improved  and  sustainable  outcomes  for  residents’ 
wellbeing.

the  challenges  facing  Pittsburgh,  gathering  input  from  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  convening  residents  for  Deliberative 
Community Forums using the Deliberative Democracy process (see pg. 97 for more information), and connecting with other 
members of the 100RC network. From June 2015 through January 2017, more than 600 Pittsburghers were engaged to support

PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES:

STRESSES & SHOCKS

The threats to Pittsburgh’s resilience form a constellation of risks, including chronic stresses related to water management, air 
quality, equal opportunity, and aging infrastructure and potential acute shocks from extreme weather due to climate change, 
another economic collapse, or infrastructure failure (Figure 12). More detail on Pittsburgh’s resilience challenges can be found 
in the PRA, available for download from the city’s website. 

Chronic stresses are long-term, slow burning issues 
that overwhelm the capacity of city resources and 
erode resident wellbeing.

Acute shocks are sudden, large-scale disasters that 
disrupt city services and threaten residents

Segregated and inequitable schools, neighborhoods, and 
labor markets
High  rates  of  violence,  poor  health,  poverty,  blight,  and 
an  education  system  facing  significant  achievement  gaps 
continue  to  affect  many  of  Pittsburgh’s  communities, 
particularly populations of color and residents of low-income 
neighborhoods.  As  of  2010,  Pittsburgh  was  considered 
the  17th  most  residentially  segregated  city  of  the  50  U.S. 
metropolitan  regions  with  the  largest  populations  of  black 
residents,9 a remnant of redlining policies from the mid-20th 
century, which limited the ability of Pittsburghers of color to 
get  mortgages  in  certain  neighborhoods  (Figure  14). While 
Pittsburgh today is gaining recognition for its quality of life 
and livability, not all of the city’s neighborhoods are sharing 
in  the  same  prosperity.  Some  communities  are  negatively 
impacted  by  the  city’s  development,  as  housing  prices  rise 
and employment growth among historically disadvantaged 
populations  remains  relatively  stagnant.  Historical  and 
structural  racial  discrimination  is  evident  in  Pittsburgh’s 
neighborhood 
inequities 
continue  to  play  a  role  in  influencing  the  quality  of  life  of

the  early-mid  20th  century 

Aging infrastructure
Much of Pittsburgh’s infrastructure, including transportation 
networks,  water  and  sewer  management  systems,  and 
housing  stock,  was  constructed  during  the  population 
boom  of 
(Figure  17). 
Select  neighborhoods  in  the  city  have  benefited  from 
redevelopment  over  the  past  few  decades,  but  deferred 
repairs and upgrades in many communities have left a capital 
burden that currently strains city and county resources. For 
example,  Allegheny  County’s  sanitary  sewer  system,  which 
services the city and 82 neighboring communities, is aging, 
poorly  maintained,  and  inadequately  sized  to  capture  and 
treat stormwater during the region’s frequent wet weather 
events.  Pittsburgh  Water  and  Sewer  Authority’s  (PWSA) 
drinking water system is similarly strained, and loses at least 
one quarter of water treated at its single treatment plant to 
pipe  leaks  or  bursts.38    And  concerns  are  mounting  about 
aging and corroding pipes releasing lead into drinking water.

Moreover,  modernization  of  Pittsburgh’s  energy  and 
communications  systems  is  required  to  help  the  city  to 
achieve  its  goals  of  innovation  and  sustainability.  The  city 
relies on a large-scale, interconnected electricity distribution 
system. Temporary power outages are common in the city 
and  are  likely  to  increase  as  the  energy  grid  is  strained 
during  extreme  weather  events.  Aging  infrastructure  not 
only contributes to degradation in these networks but can 
also render the whole system vulnerable to widespread and 
cascading infrastructure failure. 

Fragmentation across governments and non-profits
Fragmentation challenges local governance and the ability 
to  address  endemic  stresses  facing  Pittsburghers. The  City 
of  Pittsburgh  alone  includes  90  neighborhoods,  while 
Allegheny  County  has  130  municipalities,  and  the  ten-
county metropolitan region includes over 900 government 
units.  Each  municipality  has  independent  responsibility 
for  managing  infrastructure  and  administering  many  local 
services, making it far more difficult for the city to plan and 
collaborate  with  the  diverse  and  plentiful  local  political 
entities.  Concurrently,  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  is  home  to 
over 3,100 non-profit organizations, many with overlapping 
missions, and often competing for the same resources. Finally, 
ongoing planning efforts related to climate action, inclusive 
economic  development,  stormwater  management  and 
other  priorities  abound  in  the  city,  demanding  intentional 
integration in order to capitalize on the opportunity for co-
benefits.  

Industrial legacy
Like many other Midwestern cities, Pittsburgh’s population 
and built infrastructure are both aging. Economic hardship 
in  the  late  20th  century  led  to  deferred  maintenance  of 
roads, bridges, and water and sewer management systems. 
As  jobs  left  the  city,  Pittsburgh’s  population  started  to 
shrink  and  baby  boomers  that  remained  began  to  age  as 
the city struggled to retain young people for its workforce. 
Pittsburgh’s industrial past also led to a slew of air, water, and 
soil quality issues that plague the city to this day.

Aging population and workforce 
The  proportion  of  elderly  residents  (age  65  and  older)  in 
Allegheny  County  was  16.7  percent  in  2010,  compared 
with 13 percent for the nation as a whole. This proportion 
is  projected  to  grow  to  21  percent  by  2040,  mirroring 
national demographic trends.12 An aging population poses 
challenges in terms of city and regional services, workforce 
maintenance  and  growth,  and  provision  of  healthcare  and 
public health services. 

The  proportion  of  baby  boomers  nearing  retirement  is 
especially  large  in  Pittsburgh,  where  1.2  million  workers 
will  need  to  be  hired  or  up-skilled  over  the  next  10  years. 
Some  of  Pittsburgh’s  key  industries  will  likely  be  hit  by 
retirements,  including  energy,  manufacturing,  and  utilities 
service delivery; these changes open opportunities for new

 16% of the operational bridges in Pittsburgh were 
considered  structurally  deficient,  and  22  of  those 
51  deemed  “structurally  deficient”  were  principal 
arterial connections.40

• 

• 

Pittsburgh  and  the  surrounding  river  system  contain 
23  locks  and  dams  used  to  regulate  water  flow, 
transportation, and water supply to the city.39

Storm and wastewater management: 
• 

 9  billion  gallons  of  combined  stormwater 
and wastewater overflows yearly41

•  ALCOSAN  (the  Allegheny  County  Sanitary  Authority, 
which  operates  the  only  sewer  treatment  facility  for 

Pittsburgh and 82 neighboring municipalities) is bound 

by  an  EPA  consent  decree  to  reduce  combined  sewer 
overflows by at least 85%.41

Natural gas conveyance: 
•  A natural gas leak in the city’s conveyance system occurs 

every 2 miles.42

Housing and building stock:
•  Most houses in Pittsburgh are over 60 years 

old.43

• 

Renter-occupied properties approaching a median age 
of 65 years.43

Electricity grid: 
•  During the polar vortex of 2014, a regional transmission 

operator lost 22% of its capacity.44

Due  to  the  age  and  condition  of  much  of  the  City  of 
Pittsburgh’s  infrastructure  and  with  the  potential  strain 
placed  on  infrastructure  due  to  extreme  weather,  the 
possibility  of  infrastructure  failure  is  a  growing  concern. 
Because  of  the  city’s  dynamic  topography  of  hills,  valleys, 
and waterways, for instance, any failure to a key road, tunnel, 
or  bridge  could  immobilize  residents,  potentially  isolating 
thousands of individuals until access is restored.

Environmental degradation: air, water, and soil
Pittsburgh’s  industrial  past  and  aging  infrastructure  have 
led  to  air,  water,  and  soil  contamination.  Pittsburgh  still 
ranks among the top U.S. cities for worst air quality, and in 
wet  weather,  the  combined  sewer  system  overflows  and 
spills raw sewage into the city’s rivers. Much of the current 
air,  water,  and  soil  degradation  stems  from  Pittsburgh’s 
industrial  legacy,  when  the  sky  was  dark  with  smoke  at 
noon.45 In 2012, EPA categorized the region as an air quality 
non-attainment  area,  and  Pittsburgh’s  air  quality  was  14th 
worst  (24-hour  PM2.5)  in  the  country  as  of  2016.46  This 
represents an improvement over recent years, though health 
and environmental impacts of poor air quality persist. New 
industries  moving  into  the  city  and  the  surrounding  area, 
including  an  ethane  cracker  plant  and  hydraulic  fracturing 
operations, will have additional environmental impacts.

Inequity based on class
While racial inequity is especially pronounced in Pittsburgh, 
the city looks similar to many other Northeast or Midwestern 
cities in terms of inequities based on income. Lower-income 
Pittsburghers of any race or ethnicity tend to have less access 
to services, worse educational outcomes, and poorer health 
than their middle- and high-income counterparts. Prolonged 
disinvestment 
suburbs—
particularly in the Monongahela Valley, where vacancy and 
crime  are  on  the  rise—could  have  spillover  effects  region-
wide.47

Opioid crisis   
Substance  use  disorders  are  becoming 
increasingly 
prevalent  in  Western  Pennsylvania.  Opioids  are  a  class  of 
drug often prescribed for pain, but recreational use of such 
drugs is often linked to substance use disorders, which are a 
contributing factor in its rising number of opioid overdose 
deaths.  In  2014  and  2015,  Pennsylvania—in  particular, 
Allegheny, Westmoreland, and Washington counties within 
Western  Pennsylvania—experienced  some  of  the  highest 

31

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYoverdose  deaths  per  capita  of  any  region  of  the  country.48 
Many  experts  now  characterize  the  opioid  problem  in 
Western Pennsylvania and across the United States as a public 
health emergency, partially predicated on the breakdown of 
social services, sense of isolation, and dislocation from the 
new economy observed broadly in communities across the 
region.

Gender-based inequity
Women in Pittsburgh struggle with pay inequity.49 Pittsburgh 
also ranks 96th out of 100 metro areas in promoting women-
owned  businesses,  and  the  city  lags  behind  many  other 
metro areas in growth of women-owned businesses. There 
has  also  recently  been  increased  awareness  of  the  ways  in 
which  racism  and  sexism  impede  the  wellbeing,  academic 
success, and positive development of Black girls and women 
in  Pittsburgh,  such  as  through  higher  poverty,  school 
discipline, and exposure to violence.28  

Invasive species
Pittsburgh’s urban forest is one of its greatest assets: almost 
40,000  trees  were  inventoried  in  the  city—amounting  41 
percent of the city having tree cover—which has been found 
to  provide  substantial  ecosystem  services  to  the  city  each 
year.50-52 However, the region’s tree canopy is susceptible to 
pests,  invasive  species,  and  other  risk  factors.  An  alarming 
67 percent of the city’s tree canopy is at risk of destruction 
by the Asian longhorned beetle. The emerald ash borer was 
first identified in Pittsburgh in 2007 and attacks all ash trees, 
which make up nine percent of the city’s tree canopy. Other 
threats include fungus, disease, and invasive plant species. A 
decrease in tree canopy would not only reduce air and water 
quality and stormwater benefits, but destabilize hillsides as 
well.51
  

POTENTIAL SHOCKS IN AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE

While  the  stresses  Pittsburgh  experiences  erode  resident 
wellbeing  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  the  potential  for  future 
catastrophic events looms on the horizon. While Pittsburgh’s 
geography  protects  it  from  a  number  of  climate  change 
impacts, the likelihood of severe weather and related shocks 
is expected to increase in the future.

Climate change and extreme weather
Pittsburgh  confronts  a  variety  of  challenges  from  extreme 

32

weather,  and  most  emerging  evidence  suggests  that  the 
risks will grow with climate change:

• 

Precipitation  and  flooding:  Much  of  the  city 
is 
adjacent  to  rivers  and  streams  and  their  floodplains, 
and  local  weather  patterns  can  produce  a  range  of 
extreme  precipitation  events.  Lack  of  capacity  in  the 
city’s  stormwater  management  system,  combined 
with  Pittsburgh’s  topography  and  changing  weather 
patterns,  have  led  to  an  increase  in  flash  flooding  in 
recent years. Such events have caused major disasters 
in  the  city’s  history,  but  climate  change  could  make 
extreme  weather  events  in  Pittsburgh  either  more 
frequent, more intense, or both. 

•  Winter  storms:  Large  winter  storms  are  relatively 
common in Pennsylvania and are expected to happen 
more frequently. Major winter storms occur an average 
of five times per year in Pennsylvania, and since 2003, 
Pittsburgh  has  experienced  three  major  snowstorms 
which  led  to  emergency  declarations.39  In  the  coming 
decades, the Northeastern United States is projected to 
experience  a  greater  number  of  major  winter  storms, 
with an average precipitation increase of 5 to 20 percent.
Extreme 
temperatures:  Extreme  hot  and  cold 
temperatures  are  expected  to  have  a  greater  impact 
on the city in the future. Long and extended cold spells 
are  common  during  winters  in  Pittsburgh.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  climate  is  warming,  and  temperature 
fluctuations are increasing. Pittsburgh also experiences 
an “urban heat island effect,” in which cities with more 
thermal  mass  tend  to  be  1  to  3  degrees  warmer  than 
surrounding rural areas.53 Pittsburgh’s aging population 
and housing infrastructure, including outdated heating 

• 

• 

and  cooling  systems,  place  residents  at  increased  risk 
of  negative  health  effects  stemming  from  extreme 
temperatures.
Landslides  and  subsidence  incidents  regularly  affect 
parts of the city and may only get worse. The city and 
region have a long history of coal extraction and related 
erosion, putting many areas at risk for subsidence and 
sink holes in addition to the landslide risk to Pittsburgh’s 
fragile hillsides. These risks are exacerbated by extreme 
weather  events  such  as  heavy  rainfall.  In  fact,  900 
structures within the city limits are considered to be in 
areas “very hazardous to landslides”, and all of Allegheny 
County  is  classified  as  a  “high  incidence”  area  for 
landslides.39,54 In recent years, landslides have occurred 
in  the  neighborhoods  of  Oakland,  Greenfield,  and 
Perry  North.  In  2014,  wet  weather  caused  a  landslide 
on Mount Washington which covered 100 yards of rail 
lines, halting train traffic for 2 days.

Economic collapse
While  Pittsburgh’s  economy  is  increasingly  reliant  on  the 
healthcare, education, and technology sectors, these sectors 
are  also  experiencing  rapid  changes.  Pittsburgh’s “eds  and 
meds”  economy  is  in  the  spotlight  as  health  care  reform 
continues to be evaluated and increasing attention is paid 
to  the  cost  of  higher  education. The  volatility  within  these 
two drivers of Pittsburgh’s economy creates concern about 
the  risk  of  a  significant  economic  collapse,  not  unlike  that 
of  the  steel  industry  in  the  mid-20th  century.  Moreover, 
general economic trends of globalization, automation, and 
reliance  on  technology  may  pose  additional  challenges 
for  Pittsburgh’s  key 
industries.  However,  these  trends, 
if  capitalized  upon  strategically,  also  have  the  potential 
to  provide  substantial  economic  opportunities  given 
Pittsburgh’s growing technology startup sector. Finally, the 
significant proportion of Pittsburgh residents employed by 
non-profits would also be negatively impacted by changes 
in government contracts, public or private grant making, or 
charitable  giving  precipitated  by,  or  independent  of,  other 
economic shifts. Increased venture capital funding for new 
startups  and  support  for  owner-occupied  small  businesses 
in the city’s neighborhoods would help to stave off negative 
impacts of major shifts in the city’s key industries. 

Hazardous materials incident
Hazardous  materials,  including  oil  and  natural  gas  from 
the  Marcellus  and  Utica  shale  formations,  are  transported 
directly  through  the  City  of  Pittsburgh  by  road,  rail,  and 
barge  multiple  times  per  day,  increasing  the  risk  of  an 
accident occurring within the city. Pittsburgh is a hub for a 
series of major transportation routes, including I-376, I-279, 
Route 28, Route 65, several rail lines, and the three rivers,39 
and an estimated 1.5 million people in Pennsylvania live in 
an area that could be affected by a train derailment resulting 
in a fire.55

resources, and a reduced carbon footprint

The analysis of Pittsburgh’s shocks and stresses, coupled with 
extensive  feedback  from  Resilient  Pittsburgh  stakeholders 
and participants (see appendix _ for methodology), informed 
the resilience goals and objectives that comprise Pittsburgh’s 
resilience  framework.  This  framework  describes  not  only 
what a future resilient Pittsburgh will look like but also notes 
how specific sectors will play a role in addressing the chronic 
stresses facing the city and preparing for potential shocks. 

Pittsburgh’s  resilience  goals  are  aligned  with  the  p4 
framework, which has been adopted by the City of Pittsburgh 
and  partners  city-wide  to  inspire  urban  development  that 
is  “innovative,  inclusive,  and  sustainable.”  The  resilience 
framework adds specificity to p4, detailing specific objectives 
to  be  undertaken  in  order  to  meet  Pittsburgh’s  resilience 
goals (Figure 18). The framework is holistic and community-
centered,  and  acknowledges  the  integrated  cross-sector 
activity that must also occur to achieve resilience. Resilience 
actions detail ongoing activities that provide resilience value 
because  they  address  stresses  and  shocks  as  well  as  new 
actions that are needed to build a more resilient Pittsburgh.

PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE GOALS

PEOPLE
Pittsburgh will empower all residents to contribute 
to  thriving  and  supportive  communities  by  ensuring  that 
basic needs are met. We will be an inclusive city of innovation

As a step towards improved alignment and coordination, Resilient Pittsburgh has also sought to better 
understand the implementation status of city and regional actions that help realize resilience objectives. 
Addressing  the  goals  of  Pittsburgh’s  resilience  strategy  requires  not  only  the  initiation  of  some  new 
actions  but  also  better  coordination,  amplification,  and  acceleration  of  ongoing  governmental  and 
nongovernmental activities and initiatives. 

• 

• 

Initiate: Develop and implement new initiatives. Next steps entail identifying lead organizations 
and assembling working groups to begin action plans.
Coordinate: Align ongoing actions with multiple owners and actors to a common set of goals. 
Next steps involve determining governance processes and roles and responsibilities for diverse 
partners.

•  Amplify:  Expand  scope,  reach,  and/or  impact  of  pilot  or  recently  initiated  actions.  Next  steps 
entail identifying the ways in which actions ought to be expanded, additional resources required, 
and plans or proposals for new funding resources.

•  Accelerate:  Support  the  implementation  and/or  uptake  of  existing  actions  with  established 
leadership and concrete next steps. Next steps involve creating action plans to fast-track specific 
elements of each action group.

Figure 25 shows an example of how Resilient Pittsburgh might engage with actions at different stages of 
implementation, with example actions included. Appendix A of the strategy provides a full list of actions

eliminating  racial  inequities  and  ensuring  that 
all  Pittsburghers  have  the  opportunity  to  live  in 
healthy  and  safe  neighborhoods,  to  connect  to 
economic opportunity and wealth generation, and 
to  participate  in  decision-making.  Neighborhood 
Allies,  UrbanInnovation21,  and  other  partnering 
organizations  have  begun  working  to  implement 
these recommendations.

direction  of  the  Pittsburgh  Black  Elected  Officials 
Coalition,  the  P&JI  was  founded  to  “increase  public 
safety,  improve  quality  of  life,  and  ensure  the  delivery 
of  fair  and  impartial  public  safety  services”  among 
constituents in the City of Pittsburgh.
The initiative endeavors to create or facilitate:

1.  An  ongoing  and  systematic  black  community 
engagement process;
2.  A  resident-informed  Peace  and  Justice  Policy 
Agenda
3.  The  implementation  of  the  Peace  and  Justice 
Policy  Agenda  utilizing  all  interested  stakeholders 
and available resources; and 
4.  A  stronger  partnership  between  city,  county 
and  state  governments  and  Pittsburgh’s  black 
communities  to  improve  public  safety  and  overall 
quality of life in those communities.

PLATFORM PARTNER ACTION: Negley Run Watershed Resilience Accelerator
LEAD: : City of Pittsburgh, 
PLATFORM PARTNER:  ARCADIS

The city region is under consent decree from the U.S. EPA to address the combined sewer overflows into the three rivers, and 
PWSA is taking a green-first approach to a solution. As part of this ongoing effort and because financing green first initiatives 
can present unique challenges, the City of Pittsburgh engaged Arcadis to host a one-day workshop to explore and advance the 
implementation of green infrastructure in the Negley Run watershed, which makes up the A-42 sewershed, comprising over 
3,000 acres of dense urban neighborhood development, commercial and light industry, and institutional campus sites.

The  goal  of  the  workshop  was  to  understand  the  current  state  of  practice  for  interagency  collaboration  and  recent 
developments in finance and implementation protocols that are relevant for Negley Run. With experts from a select group of 
community representatives, including PWSA and ALCOSAN as well as national and global experts in resilience and stormwater 
management, the session focused on global and local best practices, project value assessments, innovative financial structures, 
current governance and regulations, and possible implementation strategies for green infrastructure. 

The city will use the outputs from the workshop to inform the development of an Implementation Protocol that can be applied 
to green infrastructure projects for Negley Run and serve as a blueprint for other similar projects in other areas of the city.

LEAD: City of Pittsburgh, Department of Innovation 
and  Performance;  Western  Pennsylvania  Regional 
Data Center (WPRDC); and partners
Shared/integrated data efforts

Data sharing initiatives are ongoing in the city, where 
the  Western  Pennsylvania  Regional  Data  Center, 
the  city’s  open  data  portal,  acts  as  a  single  data 
hub  to  support  community  initiatives  by  making 
public  information  easier  to  find  and  use.  Data  is 
increasingly  being  shared  to  support  action  in  a 
range  of  sectors,  including  health,  transportation, 
and public safety, both within the City of Pittsburgh, 
for example, through the use of Accela to coordinate 
efforts  across  city  departments  (see  breakout  box 
on pg. 82) , and by public sector agencies, academic 
institutions,  and  non-profit  organizations.  Data 
sharing provides a foundation on which to address 
shared issues and reduce the stovepiping that often 
inhibits  collaboration,  while  empowering  residents 
with information about their community.

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYIMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY

The  strategy  offers  a  single,  unifying  way  to  strengthen 
the resilience and wellbeing of all Pittsburgh residents. For 
the  promise  of  the  strategy  to  be  realized,  the  city  plans 
to  support  a  series  of  implementation  steps  through  the 
next  year  to  ensure  coordinated  and  effective  rollout  and 
adoption by a range of sectors and stakeholders.   

In  the  near  term,  the  city  will  integrate  resilience  strategy 
into  core  government  activities,  as  evidenced  by  the 
institutionalization  of  the  Resilient  Pittsburgh  team  to 
the  Division  of  Sustainability  and  Resilience  within  the 
Department  of  City  Planning,  the  creation  of  action 
leadership  teams  on  themes  from  the  strategy  (e.g., 
economic development and workforce, cohesive monitoring 
and  evaluation),  and  clear  resource  allocations  to  support 
priority  strategy  objectives.  These  near-term  steps  will 
ensure that the strategy produces clear outcomes but also 
catalyzes continued dialogue and immediate action. Further, 
in  order  to  facilitate  implementation,  the  city  will  need  to 
effectively  organize  current  city  activities  to  realize  their 
respective  benefits  for  resilience.  Finally,  in  the  long  term, 
organizational alignment and smart resource allocation will 
be important for strategy maintenance and sustainability. 

NEAR-TERM IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

The  release  of  the  resilience  strategy  will  take  on  a 
multifaceted  approach,  both  to  ensure  the  work 
is 
representative  of  diverse  stakeholders  and  to  realize 
maximum  impact.  The  Resilient  Pittsburgh  website  will 
outline highlights from the strategy document, serve as the 
platform for measuring progress over time, and will host a 
repository  of  ongoing  events  and  initiatives  related  to  the 
strategy. A video will provide additional context for the vision 
of  Resilient  Pittsburgh  and  inspire  Pittsburghers  to  create 
positive  change  in  their  neighborhoods  and  households. 
Finally, an investment prospectus will draw from the actions 
featured in the strategy to address resilience challenges, and 
motivate funding for resource coordination and reduction of 
fragmentation among philanthropic initiatives. 

The Division of Sustainability and Resilience will serve as the 
lead office for strategy implementation. The Office will also 
focus  on  four  pathways  to  implement  the  strategy  in  year 

84

one: 

1.  Convene action leadership groups
2.  Establish  a  governance  and 

institutionalization 

framework

3.  Establish a measurement framework
4. 

Integrate resilience-building into civic engagement 
and public events. 

1. Convene action leadership groups
Resilient  Pittsburgh  recognizes  that  the  city  government 
cannot  execute  this  strategy  alone.  It  was  developed 
collaboratively  as  a  citywide  collaborative  effort,  and  also 
addresses a range of regional resilience challenges. Tackling 
fragmentation  within  the  city’s  systems  and  between  the 
city and external organizations is central in the first year of 
strategy implementation. 

A  series  of  events  and  round-tables  will  bring  together 
diverse  organizations  working  on  systemic  issues  –  for 
example, water quality, education, energy, and public health 
– to establish leadership and coordination in solving some of 
the city’s most pressing challenges. Improved coordination 
will result in resource efficiency, better communication and 
long lasting partnerships, as well as agility across sectors for 
a deeper analysis of what is truly driving challenges to city 
resilience. Establishing leadership within topical areas is also 
intended  to  motivate  both  city  departments  and  external 
organizations  to  lead  implementation  of  the  resilience 
strategy over the long-term. 

2. Establish a governance and institutionalization 
framework
Institutionalization  of  the  resilience  focus  within  city 
government  will  ensure  that  the  strategy  remains  relevant 
regardless  of  changes  in  personnel  or  shifts  in  political 
leadership.  The  location  of  the  Division  of  Sustainability 
and Resilience within the Department of City Planning will 
support  long-term  integration  of  resilience  by  establishing 
formal  resilience  commissions  and  committees 
in  the 
coming year. 

As a first step, Resilient Pittsburgh will work with members 
of  the  resilience  strategy  steering  committee  to  convene 
a  governance 
framework  group,  which  will  provide 
recommendations to the Mayor for establishing commissions 
and implementation structures. 

3. Establish a measurement framework: Pittsburgh 
Survey 2.0
To  document  progress  and  monitor  the  effectiveness  of 
resilience-building 
initiatives  and  actions,  the  Resilient 
Pittsburgh  team  will  begin  to  establish  a  measurement 
framework  in  the  first  year.  Currently,  existing  information 
about  city  needs  is  diffused  and  fragmented  across  the 
city  both  in  government  and  nongovernmental  activities. 
One  important  ongoing  measurement  effort  is  the  p4 
Performance  Measures  Project,  which  aims  to  “provide  a 
comprehensive evaluation tool for the consistent assessment 
of real estate development projects in the city of Pittsburgh 
to  advance  sustainable  and  equitable  development 
practices.”63 The  Measures  are  currently  in  use  by  the  URA 
as a new method for evaluating the benefit and impact of 
a  site  development  project  receiving  public  investment. 
Building upon the p4 Performance Measures and other data 
collection and measurement efforts underway, Pittsburgh is 
poised to develop a holistic and coordinated way to capture 
progress towards city resilience and wellbeing using a more 
integrated survey method. 

A “Pittsburgh  Survey,  2.0”,  which  is  inspired  by  a  ground-
breaking survey of city residents administered over a century 
ago,  will  address  some  of  the  challenges  identified  in  this 
implementation  section.64  It  will  serve  as  a  comprehensive 
information  system  to  align  and  support  Pittsburgh’s 
initiatives (at the public level, while also available to private 
entities,  non-profits,  and  foundations)  from  now  through 
2030. 

The  Survey  will  become  the  central  monitoring  and 
evaluation  mechanism  for  the 
implementation  of  this 
resilience strategy. It will centrally track existing secondary 
and administrative data that supports resilience and identify 
places where new or primary data collection is needed. The 
Survey  will  include  core  resilience  and  related  wellbeing 
objectives, organize relevant actions like those in the strategy, 
and offer a foundation of data to link the effectiveness and 
efficiency  of  current  investments,  initiatives,  policies,  and 
programs to support resilience and wellbeing in Pittsburgh.

4. Integrate resilience into civic engagement and public 
events
To  bring  resilience  into  prominence  in  the  larger  city 
narrative,  the  Resilient  Pittsburgh  team  will 
integrate 

resilience-building  into  civic  engagement  initiatives  and 
existing events. In year one, Love Your Resilient Block grants 
will fund community-driven projects that address the city’s 
resilience challenges at the neighborhood level. 

Resilience Fairs and a series of citywide events will leverage 
partner organizations’ ongoing resilience-building initiatives. 
By  utilizing  partnerships,  Resilient  Pittsburgh  will  connect 
with regional audiences and engage residences, businesses, 
and institutions in learning about and celebrating resilience 
in all facets of life in Pittsburgh. 

Overall,  near-term  implementation  will  focus  heavily  on 
institutionalization  and  reducing  fragmentation  in  both 
government  and  nongovernmental  areas, 
fostering  a 
regional  atmosphere  of  collaborative  problem  solving  and 
resource coordination. Year one of implementation is about 
bringing people, neighborhoods, and organizations together 
as we prepare to address the future uncertain challenges that 
all Pittsburghers will face from climate change, globalization, 
and urbanization.

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYLONG-TERM IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS

The Pittsburgh resilience strategy requires a comprehensive 
implementation  plan  to  support  uptake,  integration,  and 
long-term  sustainability.  There  are  several  ways  in  which 
the  strategy  could  be  propelled  to  advance  its  vision  and 
objectives but also areas that could impede implementation, 
particularly after the initial activities are complete. We briefly 
describe each of the factors that will support implementation 
over  the  next  several  years  and  then  discuss  measures  to 
monitor  long-term  progress  towards  strategy  goals  and 
objectives. These measures will be included in the Pittsburgh 
Survey, described earlier.

Coordination among government and nongovernmental 
sectors
Coordination  among  government  and  nongovernmental 
sectors is central, particularly because the strategy relies on 
integrated actions by many sectors and stakeholders working 
together.  As  such,  each  action  group  will  require  lead  and 
supporting  actors  who  will  contribute  to  its  achievement. 
Further,  coordination  will  be  required  to  determine  how 
the  range  of  government  agencies,  nonprofits,  businesses, 
and  other  organizations  will  integrate  the  strategy  and  its 
objectives into their core missions and organizational plans. 

In the context of coordination, it is also important to consider 
the governance structures that will appropriately “scaffold” 
the strategy, that is, help build robust and usable plans for 
decision-making,  prioritization  of  actions,  and  resource 
allocation.  This  also 
includes  careful  planning  around 
leadership,  including  how  the  city  provides  leadership 
to  the  strategy  and  how  community  leaders  can  serve  as 
ambassadors  for  the  strategy’s  goals  and  objectives  over 
time.  

implementation 

introduced.  However, 

Resource allocation and a cohesive investment framework
Clearly, dedicated resources (both fiscal and non-fiscal) are 
important when a new endeavor like the resilience strategy 
is 
is  not  simply 
about  raising  funds  or  increasing  funding  levels.  Rather,  it 
is important to understand how resources already allocated 
in  existing  budgets  (government  and  non-government) 
support the strategy’s objectives. For example, Pittsburgh’s 
capital budget can be reviewed in light of resilience priorities 
(see example in the callout box).

CASE  STUDY  FOR  CITY  OF  PITTSBURGH  CAPITAL  INVESTMENT  DECISIONS:  ASSESSING  UTILITY 
BILLS IN THE CONTEXT OF RESILIENCE

The City of Pittsburgh owns and maintains 139 municipal buildings and dozens of additional assets for which it must pay 
monthly operating expenses. Utility bills represent one significant recurring expense: in 2016, the city expects to pay around 
$4.2  million,  $1.1  million,  and  $370,000,  respectively,  for  electricity,  natural  gas,  and  water. To  maintain  its  assets,  the  city 
makes capital investments, which may lead to reductions in monthly utility bills. To assess the relative impact of these capital 
investments  on  Pittsburgh’s  resilience,  the  city  could  conduct  several  different  analyses,  each  leading  to  different  answers 
regarding the “best” actions/decisions. It is useful to articulate how resilience outcome metrics can be mapped to the allocation 
of funding for capital investments across the city’s many building and structural assets. Some of the budgeting approaches 
could focus on strengthening city resilience through general efficiency, while others are about identifying resilience co-benefits 
from single investment choices or budget re-allocation. We use the utility budget to illustrate each approach.  

Cost-benefit analysis and action to build basic resilience and energy efficiency: Using readily available data, city assets 
could be ranked in terms of attributes such as the absolute size of the utility bills and the building age, size, structure type, 
or other physical characteristics. Based on this type of information, capital funding could be allocated to building projects 
that, for example, would lead to the greatest net reduction in monthly utility bills (such as the biggest economic “bang for the 
buck”) or the maximum economic benefit per unit cost of capital improvement investment. Table 1 provides examples of goals, 
associated metrics, and assets that would first be considered with this focus.

Resilience-focused  analysis  and  action  with  attention  to  resilience  co-benefits:  By  collecting  and  utilizing  additional 
quantitative and qualitative data on socioeconomics and community resources and assets (for example, household surveys), or 
incorporating information on externalities (for example, greenhouse gas footprint or intensity), a more sophisticated approach 
to investment can be made using the “resilience lens.” The portfolio of investments selected by considering a broader set of 
metrics and assessing the corresponding quantitative and qualitative data would likely not be the same as those selected with 
economic cost-benefit analysis alone. In this case, metrics would need to be expanded to a more holistic and complete list that 
captures all facets of city resilience, and co-benefits would be explicitly considered.

For example, if the city wanted to prioritize the improvement and functionality of emergency response services, it might choose 
to focus on these assets first. In this case, the “Medic 10” facility—with the highest total energy bill and dramatically higher 
per-square-foot energy intensity among emergency medical services facilities, which the city owns and maintains5—might 
be the clear choice. Although this facility is not the most obvious target across the full set of city assets from a total energy 
cost perspective, it has high per-square-foot energy intensity and provides the potential co-benefit of enhancing emergency 
response services that operate out of this facility.

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYThere are many instances within this strategy that suggest 
new  ways  to  align  resources  with  programs  and  policies 
already in place. The action taxonomy offered below (Figure 
25)—initiate,  coordinate,  amplify,  and  accelerate—is  a 
useful  way  to  categorize  resource  decisions.  Some  actions 
will require concentrated resources to amplify or accelerate 
progress.  Other  actions  will  benefit  from  coordination  of 
resources  from  across  government  and  nongovernmental 
sectors.   
In general, this resilience strategy can be thought of as an 
investment framework or prospectus for private and public 
sector entities in Pittsburgh. The main goals of the strategy 
(for  example,  People)  along  with  the  detailed  objectives 
inform  areas  in  which  sector-specific  investments  may 
be  needed  and  co-benefits  from  investments  could  be 
realized. Many of the maps indicating where assets are low 
and vulnerabilities are high also suggest places for targeted 
investment. 

Community awareness and ongoing education
Another  factor  that  will  facilitate  effective  implementation 
is  continued  dialogue  about  why  resilience  matters, 
how  a  resilience  lens  for  existing  and  new  programs  and 
investments  moves  beyond  traditional  silos,  and  what 
benefits  or  co-benefits  strategy 
implementation  could 
achieve. Without  the  consistent  engagement  of  Pittsburgh 
stakeholders, it will be difficult to advance interest and active 
participation  in  the  strategy  and  realization  of  its  vision. 
This includes ongoing efforts and the post-strategy launch 
to  keep  community  members  connected  to  the  strategy. 
This  education  campaign  may  require  new  engagement 
strategies,  use  of  diverse  media  approaches,  and  ongoing 
analysis of how the strategy is being received, adopted, and 
integrated by different constituencies.  

Targeted partner building
While  coordination,  resource  allocation,  and  education 
are  critical  for  implementation,  these  are  not  sufficient  in 
themselves  to  support  implementation  of  a  strategy  that 
is  holistic  and  integrated  into  whole-of-city  planning  and 
policy development. Targeted actions and investments that 
facilitate new and, in some cases, unusual collaborations, are 
essential for breaking down silos that may impede integrated 
efforts to achieve some of the strategy objectives.  

Successful  implementation  will  also  depend  on  lessons 

88

learned, information sharing, and peer city support through 
city-to-city  networks.  Existing  networks  like  100RC,  the 
National  League  of  Cities,  Urban  Sustainability  Directors 
Network,  Sister  Cities,  the  Mayors’  Compact  on  Climate 
Change,  and  the  Pennsylvania  League  of  Cities  and 
Municipalities  are  important  exemplars  that  Pittsburgh  is 
already actively engaged with.

MEASURING PROGRESS

As  described  above,  ongoing  measurement  and  regular 
analysis  and  use  of  the  data  collected  will  be  central  to 
successful  implementation.  The  resilience  objectives  and 
actions  provide  a  way  to  measure  strategy  progress. There 
are  three  approaches  for  strategy  evaluation.  First,  each 
of the objectives can be linked to metrics that assess both 
process and outcomes. This will help Pittsburgh determine 
whether  the  city  is  becoming  more  resilient  in  key  areas. 
(Table 2).

Second, the strategy will also need to track how particular 
actions are implemented against community readiness and 
the appropriateness or each action for adoption or uptake. 
The city will also want to track how well that process is taking 
shape.  For example, how well are new actions initiated; is 
there better coordination among existing actions; are current 
actions  being  amplified  to  meet  new  populations;  and  are 
particular actions being accelerated to speed up adoption? 
(Table 3)

Finally, while tables like the one above are useful for tracking 
progress  from  specific  goal  to  objective  to  resilience 
outcomes, they do not include critical monitoring of whether 
the strategy as a whole continues to meet its larger vision of 
making Pittsburgh more resilient to a range of shocks and 
stresses. As such, it will be important use a more overarching 
evaluation to determine how the systems and sectors that 
support  resilience  are  also  progressing  institutionally.  For 
example, key questions may include:

•  Do  all  sectors  across  Pittsburgh  and  regionally 
integrate  resilience  as  a  core  principle  of  mission, 
vision, and operating efforts? How is that attention to 
resilience represented?

•  Is  there  more  effective  and  efficient  coordination 
among agencies and organizations to pursue resilience 
goals and objectives?

•  Is there better communication and partnership among agencies and organizations?  

Overall, this chapter provides a clear set of near-term steps to support successful strategy implementation and outlines critical 
organizational and community factors that are required to build Pittsburgh’s resilience. Integration and alignment of metrics 
and evaluation activities across city departments and organizations will be central to achieving the primary goal and objectives 
of this resilience strategy.

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYCONCLUSION

The Pittsburgh resilience strategy establishes a bold vision for the city, building on 
the successes in recent decades and a wealth of community assets while directly 
confronting the complex challenges that the city continues to face. The resilience 
strategy is greater than a single initiative or plan. It is a guide for city decisions 
and expectations, and is built to be sustainable over time. The strategy will help 
Pittsburgh realize the central purpose of a thriving city in the 21st century: to 
create conditions in which every resident can flourish in the face of challenges 
and a community that can effectively respond and recover in any circumstance.  

The strategy comes at a critical period in Pittsburgh’s history, in which choices 
made  today  about  globalization,  urbanization,  climate  change,  equity,  and 
economic progress will set a trajectory for generations to come. It acknowledges 
the  complex  interconnections  among  city  challenges,  with  social,  economic, 
and environmental effects resulting from every major decision. As such, siloed 
and single-sector actions are not sufficient, and city government cannot solve 
problems alone. Instead, a vast array of unique contributions from government 
and  nongovernmental  organizations  needs  to  be  harnessed  to  build  on 
Pittsburgh’s  strengths,  minimize  its  vulnerabilities,  and  help  the  city  more 
effectively and cooperatively towards resilience goals. 

The  strategy  makes  organization  and  governance  central  to  its  successful 
implementation, evidenced by resilience actions like the Pittsburgh Survey 2.0 
and  other  initiatives  to  align  actions  and  measurement.  It  recognizes  that  the 
sustainability of the strategy over the long term will be rooted in a foundation 
of  near-term  achievements.  As  this  strategy  is  implemented  and  cross-sector 
coordination  improves,  Pittsburgh  will  have  more  tools  and  capabilities  to 
support its residents in addressing a range of shocks and stresses and in ensuring 
that basic needs are met. These efforts will not stop at the city borders, but are 
intended  to  provide  benefits  for  residents  across  the  metropolitan  region.  In 
a resilient Pittsburgh, basic needs will be met for all, and residents can pursue 
opportunity  for  themselves  and  their  families.  Successful  implementation  of 
the  strategy  means  that  Pittsburgh  as  a  community  can  fully  realize  its  aims 
to  be  inclusive,  celebrate  diversity,  and  promote  innovation  and  sustainable 
development.

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYAPPENDIX A: 
ACTIONS LIST

The Resilience Strategy is intended to push forward existing actions and supplement gaps with new initiatives. To identify, 
understand, and organize collective city-wide resilience building, actions have been grouped. The taxonomy in this appen-
dix highlights the status of each “action group” (a group of actions with similar intended benefit) which are also identified in 
brief in the strategy. This will help Resilient Pittsburgh determine the best way to engage and support these activities during 
strategy implementation. Each category requires a particular type of effort and, in some cases, a specific approach to collabo-
ration and measurement.

Integrating social services into Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS Community Schools)
A Pittsburgh Community Schools model would designate district buildings to serve as hubs for social-service programs 
for students and the neighborhood. Community schools provide students with equitable access to programs and services 
like medical care, psychological services, access to a food bank, English as a second language training or work education 
programs all in a familiar building: a public school. Westinghouse High School in Pittsburgh’s Homewood neighborhood has 
been operating as a community school for several years and offers a model and lessons learned for scaling to the city level.

Creating a circular economy in Pittsburgh
The city’s circular economy or waste-to-energy strategy, an innovative approach to managing Pittsburgh’s waste manage-
ment challenges while simultaneously reducing its carbon footprint, is in early stages. Local working groups established 
action plans and are working to implement short-term steps. Once fully implemented, the circular economy will result in 
upgrades to the city’s waste management infrastructure, provide a source of renewable energy to help the city reach its 2030 
climate goals, and provide new employment opportunities for Pittsburghers.

Enhancing city-to-city collaboration around shared issues
The City of Pittsburgh is involved in global sharing networks with cities around the world. These collaborations—from our 
Sister Cities to the 100RCNetwork to the German Marshall Fund’s Transatlantic Cooperation Network—are  intended to sup-
port city-to-city information sharing and collaborative problem solving around common issues. Rather than each city starting 
from scratch to solve its own problems, these networks establish lines of communication and opportunities to scale and

Consolidating student information and streamlining access to resources that are currently dispersed across agencies will 
result in a more robust information system. Articulating transparent protocols for connecting students to available resources 
will better serve student needs. This effort will increase the collective impact of current programs, services, and education ini-
tiatives by improving communication and coordination between and among professionals and the families they support. The 
goal is to connect more students to the resources they want and need when they want and need them so they can succeed 
in school and after graduation.

Measuring Pittsburgh’s resilience and wellbeing (Pittsburgh Survey, 2.0)
Pittsburgh Survey, 2.0 will not only serve as the measurement framework for this strategy and plan but will also paint a 
comprehensive picture of what life is like for today’s Pittsburgh residents. It will integrate data from the vast array of ongoing 
activities in the city as well new data collected from Pittsburgh residents. The Survey will help the city to benchmark and track 
progress toward the objectives laid out in this strategy, serve as a tool to support decision-making by aligning key priorities 
and initiatives in the city, and help to integrate and track those priority initiatives within a framework of action.

Enhancing Pittsburgh’s fiscal capacity in partnership with non-profits (Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT))
Pittsburgh’s non-profits are an important economic engine for the city, employing many Pittsburghers, serving the city’s 
residents, contributing to its national profile, and providing some of the city’s largest land-owning institutions, particularly 
its health and educational institutions. However, these institutions are tax-exempt and do not significantly contribute to the 
city’s fiscal capacity. As Pittsburgh continues to pull itself out of financial distress, the city will explore options for payment in 
lieu of taxes from non-profits in the city.

Exploring ways of institutionalizing the resilience lens in city processes
Embedding resilience in the capital budgeting process is a next logical step after the signing of the Resilience Pledge, the 
commitment of Mayor Peduto to dedicate at least 10% of the city’s capital budget to resilience-related activities. This process 
would build upon best practices in utilizing the resilience lens as a decision-making tool for making capital budget decisions 
in order to achieve the most “resilience bang for our buck.” Additionally, a Resilience Compact, similar to the Southeast Florida 
Regional Climate Change Compact and others, would formalize a partnership among local leaders and highlight strategies 
needed to collaboratively address resilience in Pittsburgh.

Exploring the creation of the Resilience Institute of Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh has wealth of research institutions, including its universities, consultancies, and independent research institutions, 
that are already engaged in work to benefit the city and improve the ways in which it operates. While city data is increasingly 
available via shared data systems, demands for analytical capabilities are growing to ensure that data can be used to inform 
decision-making. The city’s data and analysis assets highlight an opportunity to institutionalize a core of researchers dedicat-
ed to resilience-related topics. The city will explore ways in which it can capitalize upon its homegrown research capacity to 
help it solve future challenges, such as exploring ways to repurpose Pittsburgh’s waste for energy.

increase access to healthy foods, and is expanding its footprint in terms of urban agriculture. But a good number of Pitts-
burghers still go hungry, and many others lack access to a range of healthy food options. Coordinating ongoing initiatives, 
programs, and actors would help Pittsburgh feed more residents for its efforts.

Efforts to “green” Pittsburgh’s housing stock abound, as do approaches to make the city’s homes healthier and safer places to 
live. These include a range of players, such as county- and city-administered federal funding for lead issues, private compa-
nies offering incentives and programs to improve energy efficiency, public service providers and city departments conduct-
ing home safety inspections, and non-profits offering programming to help residents to reduce their utility bills. Coordination 
of these efforts, through programs like the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative, will extend their impact.

activities currently underway to assist with workforce development and career and technical training for adults, including 
technical training programs sponsored by industries anticipating workforce transitions. Better coordination of the city’s ongo-
ing activities would help establish a pipeline of qualified Pittsburghers ready to fill vacancies left by retirees and positioned

efforts to connect local startups with the City of Pittsburgh to improve city operations and to give entrepreneurs access 
to representatives from all relevant departments within city services. Initiatives also help entrepreneurs locate and secure 
capital resources and provide mentorship opportunities for starting and growing new businesses. Initiatives to grow capital 
to support knowledge-based start-ups and to expand small businesses started in the city are ongoing. Key next steps will 
involve developing mechanisms to coordinate capital and to provide a pathway by which new capital can be introduced.

Improving community-police relations
As a participant in the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, Pittsburgh’s 
community policing initiatives are in the spotlight. However, the federal program’s future may be in question, and the recent 
departure of Chief Cameron McClay, who prioritized improved community-police relations during his tenure, leaves local 
implementation in question as well. Nevertheless, a priority for resilience strategy implementation is to ensure that ongoing 
efforts in community outreach, technology-assisted citizen engagement, and open police data can be sustained and ampli-
fied regardless of potential changes in federal support or funding to achieve a greater impact on public safety and improved 
community-police relations.

In and out of school, Pittsburgh’s children are receiving training and building skills and enthusiasm to pursue 21st centu-
ry jobs in engineering, computer science, advanced manufacturing, and more – sectors that characterize Pittsburgh’s key 
growth industries. Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) initiatives are currently being piloted in primary 
and secondary schools around the region, and select afterschool programs and city-run community centers are exploring 
ways to integrate these principles into their programming. Expanding the scope of these largely pilot and small-scale efforts 
would contribute to a school-to-work pipeline accessible to all of Pittsburgh’s children.

Supporting job and life skills for Pittsburgh’s youth of color
A body of data has raised concerns about barriers to healthy development, education, and economic opportunity for Pitts-
burgh’s youth of color. The city participates in the My Brother’s Keeper program, which lays out a roadmap for addressing the 
opportunity gap for boys and young men of color. A recent report has also offered recommendations for how to positively 
change the trajectory for Black girls and women. Regardless of how the national My Brother’s Keeper program proceeds in 
future years, it will be up to local partners to sustain and amplify the impact of the program in Pittsburgh.

Addressing the opioid epidemic
There is growing recognition of the need for a coordinated policy response to the opioid epidemic in areas like Western Penn-
sylvania. Current recommendations for the region from the Allegheny County Health Department include mapping how the 
recommendations of the National Heroin Task Force Report are being implemented on a regional level and setting framework 
for moving forward. The plan underscores the importance of integrating public health and public safety to reduce overdoses, 
catalogs regional efforts to highlight existing best practices that can be deployed in other settings, exposes gaps, identifies 
next steps, and creates a continuum of care model to maximize interventions.

Pittsburgh’s Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) process helps to identify potential manmade or 
natural threats and hazards to the City of Pittsburgh. Key steps include describing the context, assessing capacity to respond, 
and developing recommendations, including resource requirements. Planning activities building upon THIRA, including Haz-
ard Mitigation Plan updates, will serve as a blueprint for reducing property damage from natural or manmade disaster and 
will focus on saving lives from the effects of any future disaster. Moreover, Pittsburgh’s emergency management and public

increasingly being shared by public sector agencies, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations in order to support 
action in a range of sectors, including health, transportation, and public safety. Data sharing supports resilience by providing 
a foundation to address shared issues and reduce the stovepiping that often inhibits collaboration, while also empowering

The Resilient Pittsburgh team is comprised of the city’s CRO Grant Ervin, the City Resilience team in the Division of Sustainability 
and  Resilience,  RAND  Corporation  as  the  strategy  partner,  and  100RC.  The  team  developed  this  strategy  by  researching 
the  challenges  facing  Pittsburgh,  gathering  input  from  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  convening  residents  for  Deliberative 
Community Forums using the Deliberative Democracy process, and connecting with other members of the 100RC network. 
From June 2015 through January 2017, more than 500 Pittsburghers were engaged to support the strategy development 
(Figure 10).

Determining and prioritizing stresses and shocks

The  city  developed  a  preliminary  list  of  stresses  (chronic,  long-term,  slow-burning  issues)  and  shocks  (sudden,  large-scale 
disasters) for Pittsburgh’s application to become a member of the 100RC network. This was augmented with additional items 
drawn from secondary sources, and resulting items were prioritized using a rating activity during the Pittsburgh resilience 
strategy kick-off workshop in June 2015. The list was reviewed and vetted by subsequent focus groups and working sessions 
during Phase 1 to produce the Preliminary Resilience Assessment. 

Developing Pittsburgh’s resilience framework: goals, objectives, and actions

Phase 1 concluded with the identification of discovery and overarching themes which informed the more in-depth research, 
additional engagement, brainstorming of new solutions, prioritization, and synthesis work that took place in Phase 2 (Figure 
11). Cross-sector working groups were assembled around the discovery areas, which correspond to the goals of this strategy 
and elements of the p4 framework: basic needs and opportunity (People) and infrastructure and land use (Place). A working 
group  was  also  assembled  to  discuss  the  overarching  issue  of  Systems  Performance  (Performance),  primarily  focused  on 
fragmentation and coordination of agencies working on shared issues. All working groups considered Pittsburgh’s resilience 
through the lens of sustainability (Planet). In addition, the issue of equity was at the core of the discussion for all working 

groups and was ultimately reflected in the final list of resilience goals and objectives.

Cross-sector  working  groups  met  two  to  three  times  over  the  course  of  Phase  2.  These  groups,  comprised  of  8  to  12 
members, included representatives from city and county government; local non-profit organizations; universities, research, 
and consultancy groups; architects and design firms; philanthropy; banking; technology; and other sectors. Meetings were 
designed to explore the issues identified for the respective discovery area; identify further areas for analysis; and brainstorm 
and prioritize goals, objectives, measurable outcomes, and existing and new actions. 

The  goals  and  objectives  described  in  this  strategy  come  directly  from  the  working  groups.  Working  groups  reviewed 
information about their respective discovery areas and were tasked with developing a single, high-level goal for their area 
using prompts like “How will we know the resilience strategy was successful related to [discovery area]?” and “How will our city 
be different in the year 2050, one generation from now?” They brainstormed goal statements and collaboratively refined the 
wording over the course of the two workshops. Participants were also asked to brainstorm measurable objectives that were 
specific to the discovery area and that would support achievement of the established goal. A prioritization activity followed, 
and a list of five to seven sector-specific objectives related to the goal were agreed upon for each discovery area. Discovery 
area goals and objectives were aligned with the p4 framework to create the final resilience goals and objectives framework for 
Pittsburgh. 

Additionally, stakeholders contributing to the strategy development, coupled with desktop research, identified a working list 
of 308 unique actions undertaken or planned by a variety of partners who could contribute to the resilience strategy’s goals. 
Some actions focused on specific sites (for example, the Green Garage Initiative in some of Pittsburgh’s downtown parking 
garages), while others recommended changes city- or region-wide (for example, Roadmap for Inclusive Innovation). The level of 
activity and number of ongoing actions suggest that new actions are being initiated regularly, so this list should be considered 
a working snapshot that will be updated on a regular basis by the Resilient Pittsburgh team through the forthcoming website.

The  Resilient  Pittsburgh  team  mapped  ongoing  actions  to  resilience  objectives  developed  by  the  working  groups  and 
determined where new actions were needed to address unmet needs. Consequently, this strategy includes new actions as well 

114

115

ONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYONEPGH: PITTSBURGH’S RESILIENCE STRATEGYas ongoing actions that need improved coordination, could be broadened in scope or funding level, or would yield greater 
benefit with an accelerated timeline. 
Using the resulting list, the resilience team grouped actions according to general topic area or sector of influence to create 
“action groups,” which were prioritized for the strategy. Some groups were defined by a single, larger-scale action (for example, 
Welcoming Pittsburgh), while others were defined by several smaller-scale actions related to a common topic. Each action 
group includes a number of programs, initiatives, and policies (referred to as “sub-actions”). Prioritized action groups met the 
following criteria:

•  They yield a resilience dividend, operating across shocks and/or stresses to achieve co-benefits.
•  They address one or more of Pittsburgh’s resilience objectives.
•  There is clear leadership by an organization, or ideally, a consortium or collaboration of organizations working on the 

action.

•  They are a priority for the Mayor’s Office and/or community stakeholders.
•  They are catalytic and represent innovation beyond “business as usual” for a city.
•  There is fiscal support for the action.

These action groups are intended to yield progress towards multiple resilience goals and objectives simultaneously, helping to 
yield a resilience dividend for the city. As a result, each action group can support multiple objectives.
