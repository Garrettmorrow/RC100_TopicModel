Santa Fe, 
a land of 
opportunity

Santa Fe has a vast experience in disaster risk management. The city 
has recovered from catastrophic floods and economic crises that have 
left painful wounds. 
After two disasters at the dawn of the 21st century (the overflow of 
the Salado River in 2003, and the heavy rains that led to significant 
flooding in2007), the city adopted disaster risk reduction as a core 
policy to be included in its development plan. At present, the city 
counts on contingency plans and early warning systems; it has also 
made progress in the field of flood risk mitigation; it has valued its 
ecosystem and redefined urban development rules. Santa Fe has built 
further capacity and preparedness and has recovered faster from 
climate events, more frequent in the last years.
We have learned to embrace living with our rivers and we have come 
up with better solutions to water-related shocks. We know that saving 
lives is fundamental, but we want to take a step forward and move 
toward resilience.
Cities throughout the world are facing increasingly complex 
challenges – social exclusion, climate change, organized crime, new 
economies, technological development, and conurbation. These 
challenges call for the adoption of new paradigms and approaches to 
city governance and urban management, in line with the international 
guidelines set forth in the Sustainable Development Goals, the Sendai 
Framework, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda. 
We believe in adopting resilience as our core approach for tackling 
these challenges, as resilience not only focuses on building the 
community’s capacity to emerge stronger from crises and acute 
shocks but also on managing chronic stresses. How can the city grow 
without causing environmental risk? How can we foster community 
integration, especially including children, young people, women and 
the elderly? These are some of the questions that guide our work. 
Because while we know that acute shocks and chronic stresses affect 
us all, the poor and the helpless are always among the hardest hit.
To make progress along the path of resilience, we have counted on 
the invaluable support of the 100 Resilient Cities’ Network, pioneered 
by the Rockefeller Foundation, since December 2014. So far, we have 
created a Resilience Office, and we have developed a strategy with 

10

PRESENTATIONspecific targets and projects designed in close collaboration with 
different city stakeholders and international experts.
This document is a summary of the measures taken throughout a 
year-long process, and of the medium and long-term measures yet to 
be taken with a vision of building an integrated and thriving city, a 
safer community with a strong spirit of solidarity, solid and convergent 
systems, a sustainable economy with opportunities for young people, 
and a city with a metropolitan approach to development.
We are convinced that this is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for Santa Fe. 
Our efforts have been awarded international recognition, and now the 
city is sharing its experience in different forums and city networks. 
Now, we count on a Resilience Strategy to shed light on the work to be 
carried out in the years to come.
There is a new political wind blowing through Argentina, which 
prioritizes dialogue and collaboration among the different levels of 
the State, which acknowledges the existence of big problems and is 
strongly determined to solve them, and which builds on values such 
as education and hard work to build a more equitable and fair country.
This is a good starting point. Cities are privileged settings where 
people’s lives develop. Cities can promote well-being or grief, 
depending on the future we envision and the way we manage it. 
The City Government is fully committed to working hand in hand 
with the community to integrate resilience-driven thinking, social 
inclusion and sustainable development into public policies, thus 
turning Santa Fe into a land of opportunity.

JoSé Manuel Corral
Mayor of the city of Santa Fe

“The City Government 
is fully committed to 
working together with 
the community to 
integrate resilience-
driven thinking, 
social inclusion 
and sustainable 
development into 
public policies, thus 
turning Santa Fe into a 
land of opportunity.”

PRESENTATIONLETTER FROM THE 100RC PRESIDENT

an 
exemplary 
vision of 
resilience

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to 
congratulate Mayor Corral and the city of Santa Fe on the release 
of Santa Fe Resiliente, a major milestone for the city and for our 
partnership. Santa Fe Resiliente lays out an exemplary vision of 
urban resilience for the city and the region. A dynamic city with a 
rich history, Santa Fe builds on its past as it lays the foundations for a 
resilient future. 
The birthplace of Argentina’s constitution, Santa Fe is a modern 
metropolis that serves as an education and science hub as well as 
a center for the one of the country’s richest agricultural regions. 
Building on groundbreaking work the city has already done, this 
Strategy sets out a clear vision to develop further resilience to Santa 
Fe’s myriad 21st century challenges. 
A city surrounded and by water, Santa Fe has long had to contend 
with rivers and lakes that regularly challenge the security of its 
urban fabric. Catastrophic floods, including in 2003 and 2007, both 
of which inundated more than a third of the city and caused the 
evacuation of over 130,000 people, led to major political change and 
pioneering work in in disaster risk reduction.
However, the city is committed to developing more meaningful urban 
resilience that strengthens the entire urban ecosystem, and enriches 
the lives of all of Santa Fe’s residents, especially its most vulnerable. 
Through the commitment and leadership of Chief Resilience Officer 
Andrea Valsagna and her team, the city has designed an ambitious 
Strategy that addresses far more than the shocks it has endured from 
flooding. The Strategy provides initiatives and actions that tackle 
stresses such as endemic crime, social exclusion, deep economic 
divisions, and other hardships experienced regularly by those living in 
informal settlements in the flood plains. It also embraces its wetlands 
and rivers as assets rather than only challenges, and provides plans 
for major parks and natural reserves that will provide educational, 
social, and economic benefits. 
This Strategy places stakeholder engagement at the center of all its 
efforts. CRO Valsagna and her team ensured that regular engagement 
with the city’s different communities and sectors was fundamental 
to their work. The Strategy reflects this, as well as the commitment to 

12

PRESENTATIONembed this active participation in the future decisions the city makes. 
Their work presents one of the clearest examples of what can be 
achieved by planning through a lens of resilience and it can serve as a 
model to others. From its early work and active engagement with the 
network, Santa Fe is well positioned to help us in leading the global 
urban resilience revolution.
Santa Fe has already shown its ability to recover, adapt and lead 
through innovative change. As the hard work now truly begins, we are 
excited to see it unfold and continue our partnership. Congratulations 
again on this enormous achievement.

MiChael Berkowitz
President, 100 Resilient Cities

“From its early 
work and active 
engagement with 
the network, Santa 
Fe is well positioned 
to help us in leading 
the global urban 
resilience revolution.”

PRESENTATIONLETTER FROM THE CRO

a long term 
vision for 
the city

What will Santa Fe be like in 20 or 50 years’ time? What do we want it 
to be like? These questions sum up the long way we have come since 
the city joined the 100 Resilient Cities Program, pioneered by the 
Rockefeller Foundation, over a year ago.
The challenge was to analyze current shocks and stresses from 
different viewpoints and with a long-term vision. We consulted 
different stakeholders - civil society actors, the private sector, 
academia, and different state level - aiming to get their input. Once 
again, we opened debate on basic questions, such as: What should be 
improved to build an inclusive, integrated, connected and thriving 
Santa Fe, pursuant to the goals set forth in the Action Plan developed 
by the City Government led by Mayor José Corral?
At present, it goes without saying that city management requires 
a comprehensive and integrated approach to challenges faced by 
different sectors. Quality of life should not only be measured in 
terms of access to basic services, but also in terms of connectivity 
and transport, infrastructure, social cohesion, open public spaces 
and integrated habitats, the value of human capital and citizen 
engagement.
Local governments are becoming more prominent in the international 
agenda, because cities and their regions face the biggest challenges of 
the 21st century. And local governments are the closest to the people; 
they are the most acquainted with local stresses, shocks and their 
negative consequences, and they must resort to new paradigms to 
address them and plan the city development. 
The Resilience Framework has enabled us to analyze communities’ 
capacity to address and overcome crises while dealing with chronic 
stresses. This approach analyzes urban development through the lens 
of equity, governance and sustainability, and takes into account all 
sides of a problem. Because low-income households are most likely 
to live in low-lying areas at greater risk of flooding, and endure the 
highest unemployment and violence rates; because infrastructure 
needs (services, transport, sewers) are correlated with climate change 
needs; because challenges transcend jurisdictional borders and call 
for a metropolitan approach; because sustainable means of living go 
hand in hand with lower vulnerability to risk.

14

PRESENTATIONThe collaborative work and networking activities carried out with 
other cities, experts and city stakeholders have been most enriching, 
and encouraged us to set ambitious targets.
Santa Fe’s Resilience Strategy envisions a city that embraces change, 
connects to opportunity, fosters residents’ engagement, and regards 
innovation as a knowledge-based outcome; a thriving city that looks 
forward, is not afraid of change and spearheads regional development; 
a city with a dynamic community that protects life and the 
environment, thus ensuring a healthier place for all of us to live in.
Santa Fe has enthusiastically lived up to the challenge of dreaming 
big, of having a long-term vision. This document sums up the 
measures to be taken in order to make those dreams come true. It 
is not an easy task; we must join efforts, build on existing capacities 
and knowledge, and work together to increase the chances of success. 
But we know we can do it, because this document is the result of hard 
teamwork and the contributions made by hundreds of institutions, 
experts and social leaders who have done their part.
I would like to express my gratitude to the 100RC Program for their 
continuous support and to Arup, our strategic partner, for helping 
us take our first step. Now, it is up to us –Santafesinians– to work 
together to build a more resilient Santa Fe.

andrea ValSagna
Chief Resilience Officer (CRO), 100 Resilient Cities

“Santa Fe has 
enthusiastically 
accepted and lived 
up to the challenge of 
dreaming big, of having 
a long-term vision. This 
document sums up the 
measures to be taken 
in order to make those 
dreams come true.”

PRESENTATIONexecutive 
summary

Santa Fe is one of the ten biggest and oldest cities in Argentina. It is 
the birthplace of the National Constitution and a center of scientific, 
cultural, commercial and service activities. It is located in a region 
with a growing agro-industry and bio-economy sector. Almost three-
quarters of its territory is covered by rivers and swamps, which have 
shaped its growth throughout history. 
After the catastrophic floods of 2003 and 2007, the city developed a 
strong risk reduction policy to further develop the preparedness of its 
government, population, institutions and infrastructure systems to 
better deal with water-related emergencies. Santa Fe has learned from 
disaster, for which it has been awarded domestic and international 
recognition; but it has also discovered that there are other shocks and 
chronic stresses to be tackled. 
In December 2014, Santa Fe was selected to join the 100 Resilient 
Cities Network (100RC), pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation; and 
in 2015, the city started to work on the preliminary assessment and 
the design of resilience-driven initiatives.
City violence, housing deficit, habitat degradation, obsolete 
infrastructure, environmental problems, social exclusion and the lack 
of personal, social and economic development opportunities are some 
of the stresses identified in the Preliminary Resilience Assessment 
(PRA), published in August 2016.
Following the PRA, the city Resilience Office worked very hard for 
ten months, conducting studies into discovery areas and asking for 
advice; organizing workshops, interviews and work meetings that 
were attended by over 1000 people to identify potential projects. 
The Resilience Strategy is the outcome of this highly participatory 
process, and is structured into four pillars, namely:
1. Embrace Change. A Santa Fe that looks into the future and works at 
a metropolitan scale.
2. Connect to Opportunity. A Santa Fe that grows with equity and 
guarantees access to basic services.
3. Foster Residents’ Engagement. A Santa Fe that fosters a sense of 
belonging, social cohesion and the right to the city.
4. Understand to innovate. A Santa Fe that manages knowledge and 
takes advantage of new technologies to foster local development.

PRESENTATIONThis document is organized into five sections: The Introduction 
presents the City Resilience Framework. The “Context and 
Challenges faced by Santa Fe” section describes the city’s strengths, 
weaknesses and emerging challenges through the lens of resilience. 
The “Resilience Strategy” section details the city’s vision, pillars 
and objectives, and includes a description of 50 initiatives devised 
as an ecosystem. Finally, the “Networking” section describes the 
collaborative work carried out with other 100RC cities and partners; 
and the “Next Steps” section depicts the actions to be taken to 
implement the Strategy. 
But this is not just a document, it is a call to action, a dynamic 
statement of goals and targets, initiatives and projects; a pledge made 
by Santa Fe’s residents to build a dynamic and thriving city, a city 
that is not afraid of innovation and change, a city full of opportunities 
to grow. A city that has learned from challenges. A city that protects 
life and embraces living in harmony with its rivers. In short, a more 
resilient Santa Fe.

100 reSilient 
CitieS initiatiVe

The city of Santa Fe, Argentina, was selected to join 
100 Resilient Cities, a program pioneered by the 
Rockefeller Foundation to help more cities around 
the world build resilience to the physical, social, 
and economic challenges that are a growing part of 
the 21st century.
The 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) program fosters 
the creation and adoption of a resilient vision to not 
only be better equipped to deal with catastrophic 
events –such as earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.– but 
also with stresses that weaken the fabric of a city

on a day-to-day or cyclical basis, such as aging 
infrastructure and unemployment.
For Santa Fe, being selected as a member of the 
100RC brings recognition by the international 
community on the progress made by the city in 
the field of water-related hazards and disaster risk 
reduction; and additionally presents a one-of-a-
kind opportunity to tackle new 21st century urban 
problems such as social inequity, violence, climate 
change and sustainable development. Within this 
framework, the Santa Fe Municipality organized 
workshops to design a Resilience Strategy, based on 
the program guidelines.
The 100RC Network supports member cities with 

logistics and funding so that they can appoint a 
Chief Resilient Officer (CRO1) and hire a team of 
professionals to lead resilience-building activities 
in the city. The network also offers member 
cities technical assistance and resilience-building 
tools and expertise to help them develop a robust 
Resilience Strategy. It also facilitates cities’ access 
to the 100RC Platform of Partners to help them 
plan and implement their strategy process. Finally, 
the 100RC network offers a global resilience 
partnership to help member cities learn from each 
other’s experience and help one another.

A Preliminary Resilience Assessment was carried out to analyze emerging themes, 
with the goal of developing a Resilience Strategy.

To start working with the 100RC network, 
the Municipality of the city of Santa Fe 
had to sign a grant agreement with 
100RC and then select and appoint a 
Chief Resilience O(cid:157)cer. During the ﬁrst 
phase, the 100 Resilient Cities Program 
Workshop was launched in Santa Fe.

STAGE 1. We identiﬁed the main stresses 
and threats facing the city. Through a 
collaborative process of stakeholder 
consultation and research, we made a 
baseline evaluation and identiﬁed 
emerging cross-cutting resilience themes 
in Santa Fe. The Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment marked the conclusion of 
Phase 1 of the Resilience Strategy 
Development process.

STAGE 2. We analyzed emerging themes 
with the goal of developing a Resilience 
Strategy. We focused on the Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment themes, and 
organized workshops, conducted 
research and drafted reports to delve 
into the challenges and identify initiatives 
to tackle them. The launch of the 
Resilience Strategy marked the 
conclusion of Phase 2.

what iS reSilienCe?

Resilience is a term that emerged from the field of 
ecology in the 1970s, to describe the capacity of a 
system to maintain or recover functionality in the 
event of disruption or disturbance. It is applicable 
to cities because they are complex systems that are 
constantly adapting to changing circumstances2. 
Thus, city resilience is defined as the capacity of 
individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, 
and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow 
no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute 
shocks they experience. To maintain a consistent 
view of what resilience means to cities worldwide, 
100RC strongly recommends a resilience framework 
that enables you to analyze existing information 
about a city, and to articulate challenges and 
opportunities through the lens of resilience.
The City Resilience Framework (CRF3) aims 
to articulate urban resilience in a measurable, 
evidence-based and accessible way that can inform 
urban planning, practice and investment patterns. 
It also describes resilience as the capacity of cities 
to function, adapt and change their behavior to 
survive and thrive shocks and stresses4.
The CRF comprises 4 dimensions, 12 drivers and 
52 sub-drivers that help cities articulate processes 
associated with building resilience. When taken 
as a whole, they represent a city’s ability to emerge 
stronger from a wide range of stresses and shocks. 
This provides a lens to understand the complexity 
of cities and can help them assess their capacity 
to recover, identify critical areas and develop 
initiatives and programs to improve such capacity. 
It also provides a common language that enables 
cities to share knowledge and experiences.

INTRODUCTIONreSilienCe Strategy deVelopMent proCeSS

The development and implementation of a 
Resilience Strategy in Santa Fe represents a one-
of-a-kind opportunity to bring about innovative 
and joint solutions, develop the preparedness of 
the city and the community, overcome current 
stresses and deal with future challenges. To that 
end, several factors proved to be essential to ensure 
a comprehensive and holistic approach: firstly, the 
innovative methodology and guidelines provided 
by the 100RC program, and secondly, the broad 
consultation process carried out by Santa Fe that 
involved different State levels, the private sector, 
academia and civil society. 
The actions developed during the strategy 
process were identified by gathering input 
from stakeholders with relevant knowledge and 
expertise, analyzing surveys and studies on the 
Partners’ Platform, interviewing technical staff 
and government officials, conducting public 
opinion polls, organizing thematic round tables and 
workshops, sourcing best practices from cities in 
the Network, and attending international summits 

such as Habitat III, Mercociudades and UNISDR 
Regional Platform. Therefore, this Strategy, its 
goals and initiatives are based on the invaluable 
insight provided by different City stakeholders. 
This participatory process allowed us to leverage 
existing knowledge and initiatives in the 
community, identify strengths and assets, gain 
access to new sources of information to make a 
deeper assessment, and identify new stakeholders, 
potential partners and projects; and all this resulted 
in a sound Resilience Strategy. It also gave us the 
chance to interact with different actors and ensure a 
multidisciplinary approach to city resilience. 
To this end, ordinance was passed by the city of 
Santa Fe to create two bodies that offer advice and 
guidance to the City Resilience Office, namely: the 
Municipal Committee of Resilience, made up of 
representatives from different City departments, 
and the Resilience Advisory Board, whose members 
represent the private and public sectors, as well as 
civil society.

Context
a hiStoriC City

Santa Fe, the capital city of the homonymous 
province, is located in Argentina's east-center. 
Founded in 1573, it was one of the first urban 
settlements in the country, and played a key role 
throughout its history, especially in colonial times, 
when the port of Santa Fe was granted the right to 
charge taxes on all passing ships (this privilege was 
called Puerto Preciso), and during the consolidation 
period of the Argentine Republic.
In 1651, due to different territorial conflicts and 
river overflows, the city was moved to its current 
site, in the confluence of the floodplains of the 
Salado and the Saladillo Rivers. Its urban grid 
expanded towards the Setúbal lagoon waterfront 
and the Coronda River, across from the islands in 
the Paraná River. This is why its borders are mostly 
rivers and over 70% of its territory –which has 
an area of 26,800 hectares– is made up of rivers, 
lagoons and swamps.
Santa Fe has a hectic political and institutional life, 
in keeping with its status as the capital city of the 
province. Due to its strategic location and port, the 
city has become a key social and economic actor, 
a melting pot where traditional and innovative 
cultural trends reflect on its buildings, churches, 
museums and heritage sites.
The city’s identity has also been shaped by some 
highly significant historical events: the Argentine 
Constitution was first enacted here in 1853, and 
the city also hosted most of the Constitutional 
Assemblies that amended the National Constitution.

a StrategiC loCation

Santa Fe is part of the “Pampeana” region – a key 
industrial, economic and agricultural area. Due 
to its strategic location in the so-called bi-oceanic 
corridor between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, 
the city of Santa Fe has become an important 
center of trade, commerce and multimodal strategic 
communication with top markets.
The city expanded towards the outskirts, giving 
birth to a new urban area called Greater Santa Fe. 
The city is also linked to the city of Paraná (in the 
province of Entre Ríos) by means of an underwater 
tunnel, and its metropolitan area is one of the 
biggest urban networks in the country.
Santa Fe is also renowned for its knowledge 
production and educational facilities, namely: 3 
national universities, 14 scientific and technical 
institutes that work in close collaboration with the 
UNL University and Conicet, and a large number 
of higher education institutions, professional 
associations and top researchers.
As a consequence of this, Santa Fe has regular 
interaction with governments and companies, 
offers a wide array of services, incorporates 
scientific and technological innovations into 
production processes, and promotes the creation of 
an entrepreneurial environment and the incubation 
of startup companies.

CONTEXT AND CHALLENGESa VulneraBle territory

Santa Fe’s geographic location has defined its 
features and shaped its development: it is located 
at the meeting point between the floodplains of 
the Salado and the Paraná Rivers and is affected by 
their periodic overflows.
As time went by, the city grid started to grow; and 
people soon settled in low-lying areas at greater risk 
of flooding, disregarding or trying to overcome this 
potential threat. To this end, different measures 
were taken: a complex levee and flood protection 
system was built, low-lying areas were filled, and 
the natural drainage system was altered. As a 
result of these measures, Santa Fe has become a 
vulnerable territory, exposed to water-related risks 
such as overflows, heavy rains or both. 

Throughout its history, Santa Fe has experienced 
several environmental disasters that claimed 
many lives and caused damage to infrastructure 
and economic losses to businesses. The two most 
significant floods –the first one caused by the 
overflow of the Salado River, and the second one 
by heavy rains– took place in 2003 and 2007, 
respectively, and they were the costliest disasters 
in the history of the city. They caused severe 
damage to infrastructure, property and systems, 
and contributed to people’s loss of trust in the 
government and the weakening of ties between 
institutions and the community. 
In 2008, a new administration took office and 
introduced a new paradigm to tackle this problem: 
it adopted a new disaster risk management system 
that became the core policy of its development

plan and protocol, developed an early local warning 
system and evacuation plans, organized emergency-
training activities and awareness-raising campaigns, 
and designed a work plan to improve flood 
protection and waste management, and increased 
green space and urban woodlands. City regulations 
were amended to limit the number of settlements 
in vulnerable areas, and the public services network 
(potable water and sewer network) was expanded to 
reach vulnerable neighborhoods. Because of these 
measures, the city has been awarded a “Role Model 
City” status, and its mayor has been appointed 
“Champion of UNISDR’s Making Cities Resilient 
campaign”. Santa Fe has become a leader in this 
field, for its successful management of overflows 
and heavy rain in subsequent years.

hydro-MeteorologiCal eVentS

The city of Santa Fe is located in a vulnerable 
territory, exposed to more frequent and extreme 
hydro-meteorological events as a consequence of 
climate change. The city depends on the overall 
condition of its flood protection and drainage 
systems to minimize the possibility of urban 
flooding caused by river overflows or heavy rains. 
These are complex and costly systems that need 
regular maintenance and surveillance to ensure 
their proper operation in case of an emergency.
The city is surrounded by 64 km of flood protection 
embankments, and has 53 pumping centers 
equipped with 152 pumps. Due to the flatness of 
the land, water drainage is slow, which causes 
direct damage to road networks, bridges and other 
infrastructure.
Since 2008, the city has implemented several 
initiatives and is now better prepared to face natural 
hazards. Records show, however, that the number 
of environmental events has increased lately 
as a consequence of climate change; therefore, 
it is essential that current and future actions 
plans consider infrastructure maintenance and 
enhancement. 
Thus, the main threats are associated with these 
environmental phenomena on the one hand, 
and on the other with the potential failure of 
protection infrastructure and its impact on the 
interdependency of systems. Threats are also 
associated with water-borne disease outbreaks and 
with the fact that the condition of this vulnerable 
area heightens the impact of national economic and 
institutional crises on this littoral region.

CONTEXT AND CHALLENGESphySiCal StreSSeS

The city grew towards the north and the west 
without an orderly urban planning policy; thus, 
the neighborhoods in those areas did not have 
access to basic public services. In recent years, 
these neighborhoods gained access to the drinking 
water supply network, which now serves 96% of 
households. At present, the main drawbacks are 
associated with poor road networks and lack of 
access to the sanitation and natural gas systems. 
The situation is further aggravated by insufficient 
or obsolete infrastructure, lack of maintenance 
and difficulties in accessing funding to upgrade 
systems and networks. 
Furthermore, despite the progress made by the 
city in the field of urban waste management (due 
to the construction of a waste management facility 
and a landfill site, and the introduction of waste 
sorting practices), waste collection is still a serious 
problem. Between 2011 and 2015, an average of 374 
tons of waste went to landfill on a daily basis, with 
an estimated lifespan of 5 to 7 years. Less than 4% 
of all waste is recycled and traded by cooperatives. 
There are 600 informal waste collectors who work 
in unhealthy conditions in small garbage dumps, 
and garbage ends up clogging the drainage system.

CONTEXT AND CHALLENGESSoCial and eConoMiC StreSSeS

The basic needs of 5.5% of the households in the 
city of Santa Fe are not met. At the provincial 
level, this figure increases to 9.7%; and at the 
national level, to 12.5%. However, this figure rises 
to 13.8% and 10.3% in the neighborhoods located 
in the northwest and the coastal areas of the city, 
respectively, home to most low-income households5.
It is very difficult for a family to have access to 
affordable and safe housing options in the city 
of Santa Fe; over 33% of the people are not home 
owners: 17% rent a house and 15.8% live either in 
a land or property which is not their own, or in a 
squatter or borrowed house.
Furthermore, 1,500 houses are located in low-lying 
areas at greater risk of flooding or where water risk 
cannot be mitigated (outside the levee ring). 3,829 
people live in those houses, and 47% have had to be 
evacuated due to river overflows.
As for the city’s economic situation, the 
employment rate has improved in the last two 
years and the figures match those of other areas 
in the Pampas region. In 2017, the commercial 
activity rate in Greater Santa Fe amounted to 43.6 
points, and although the city’s unemployment rate 
(5.1%) is lower than the national unemployment 
rate (7.6%), the truth is that one out of three 
people of working age is unemployed or is not a 
job seeker. This figure is even higher in the case of 
women and young people. The primary sources of 
formal employment are business (23%), teaching

construction (9%)6.
Endemic crime and violence are critical stresses 
faced by the city of Santa Fe. For 15 years, the 
homicide rate in Santa Fe city has been higher 
than the national average; and in 2014, it reached 
its peak with 22 intentional homicide victims 
per 100,000 people. 75.3% of homicide victims 
are shot, as guns are the main weapon used to 
perpetrate this type of crime. Most homicide 
victims are men (92.2%) and young people: 48.2% 
of the victims were aged between 14 and 24.

CONTEXT AND CHALLENGESeMerging ChallengeS and opportunitieS

In the Preliminary Resilience Assessment, some 
critical shocks and stresses were identified and 
further analyzed to gain a better understanding 
of the causes and interrelations and to develop 
projects and initiatives aimed at building city 
resilience. The emerging challenges were:
– Endemic Violence and Crime: increasing violence, 
security problems, poor performance of law 
enforcement and criminal justice systems; high 
homicide rate.
– Housing Deficit: precarious housing and slum 
settlements in low-lying areas at greater risk of 
flooding.
– Environmental Management: weaknesses are 
associated with waste disposal and lack of recycling 

activities on the one hand; and scavengers and their 
unhealthy working conditions on the other hand.
– Disaster Risk Management: pending drainage 
works, flood protection infrastructure weaknesses, 
vulnerable sectors of the population are among 
the hardest hit (no access to basic public services, 
precarious housing, violence and waste collection 
problems), and lack of residents’ commitment to 
live in harmony with their environment.
– Young People and Employment: concern for 
jobless young people and the economic perspectives 
of the city. There are too many education and 
vocational training options whereas there is little 
culture of hard work; and this impacts people’s 
access to jobs.

CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES– Transportation and Mobility: poor urban mobility 
and few public transport options hinder the 
social integration of communities from certain 
neighborhoods.
– Economic Situation: commerce, retail trade and 
services are the most important economic activities 
in the city; however, there is undeveloped potential 
to achieve economy diversification, and there are 
underused assets and innovation opportunities.

Based on this Assessment, Santa Fe set the 
following goals to better understand the 
aforementioned challenges, and thus identify the 
best resilience-driven initiatives and solutions.

GuiDiNG QueSTioNS AND TARGeTS
– Improve understanding of stresses, like safety 
and urban violence, in order to strengthen 
community integration and  create opportunities, 
especially for young people so that they can recover 
the culture of work and aim to make an honest 
living. 
– Identify squatter settlements and analyze the 
obstacles inherent to resettling families who 
live in flood prone areas; improve neighborhood 
conditions and foster inclusive communities by 
creating job opportunities and facilitating access to 
decent housing.
– Identify critical assets and key infrastructure 
threatened by climate change; gather updated 
information about the condition of the 
infrastructure system, and adopt a metropolitan 
approach to the expansion of the basic services 
network.

– Redirect resources, invest in maintenance and 
redraft plans taking into account climate change 
challenges, water risks and the increased demand 
on services, from a metropolitan viewpoint. 
– Identify potential economic developments to turn 
Santa Fe into a regional role model and boost the 
sectors that create more quality jobs. 
– Regard water risk management as a transversal 
theme, which must be inevitably included in every 
city sustainable development plan.

CONTEXT AND CHALLENGESleSSonS learned

Throughout the Resilience Strategy Development 
process, three important lessons were learned: first, 
the process of analyzing challenges identified that 
priorities change according to the perceptions of 
different social actors, namely: government, city 
leaders and the community in general.
However, every city actor and sector agrees that 
violence and lack of safety should be given top 
priority. As for the rest of the challenges, it is 
interesting to see how opinions differ: where as 
the community in general thinks that the city 
should focus on the creation of job opportunities 
and then on people’s access to basic public services 

and infrastructure. All of them recognize that 
there is little social cohesion and little respect for 
coexistence rules, two key factors that should be 
reinforced in order to build resilience.
Second, through participatory workshops and 
focus groups, the fact that safety problems are 
closely related to other stresses emerged. In order 
to prevent crime, the State should not only improve 
law enforcement mechanisms and combat social 
exclusion, but also coordinate the performance and 
the services provided by different governmental 
agencies and meet the needs of vulnerable sectors 
of the population. 
Third, the inclusion of an integrated approach 
to security and habitat on the one hand, and to

CONTEXT AND CHALLENGESinfrastructure and economy on the other hand, was 
confirmed. The collaborative work carried out by 
representatives of civil society, the government and 
the private sector was enriching, and community 
building emerged as the main resilience challenge. 
Housing plans and control policies are not enough 
to tackle such a complex problem. The city must 
redouble efforts to improve social cohesion, which 
goes far beyond facilitating people’s access to safe 
and affordable housing and services. 
Likewise, infrastructure plans should not only be 
regarded as a response to the increased demand on 
services and on service efficiency, but also as a key 
factor to tackle challenges such as social inclusion 
and economic development. 

Finally, there are two issues that appear over and 
over again: on the one hand, the city needs to 
adopt a metropolitan approach to public policy 
development, because emerging themes transcend 
in every case jurisdictional borders. On the other 
hand, there is a pressing need to improve data 
records, optimize resources and produce indicators 
to assess policy impact. The absence of accurate 
information and records within the sphere of the 
State makes it more difficult for the government 
to engage in public debate and decision making 
processes to solve the challenges faced by Santa Fe 
and the region.

RESI-
LIENCE
STRATEGY

StruCture

Santa Fe Resilience Strategy is structured around 
4 pillars, 13 goals and 50 initiatives that reflect the 
city Vision.
The Vision depicts the aspirations the city and its 
people have for the future, that is, our target, the 
kind of city we want to become - a more resilient 
Santa Fe. 
The Pillars, which are based on the shocks and 
stresses identified in the Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment, are long-term goals that depict the 
attitude and the strategic path the city should follow 
to fulfill its resilience vision. These pillars enhance 
the cross-cutting approach Santa Fe used to develop 
its Resilience Strategy. 
Every pillar has some Goals, objectives to be 
achieved that allow us to assess the progress made 
toward becoming a more resilient city.
The Initiatives are resilience-driven ideas, actions, 
projects, programs or plans to achieve more than 
one goal; they are related to the pillars and make 
sense of the concept of ecosystem, which will be 
defined later on.

The 50 initiatives have been grouped taking into 
account two criteria: first, their impact on resilience 
building and the links among them. Thus, 
initiatives can be classified as follows:
– Featured: initiatives that stand out for their 
capacity to generate synergy, and that embody 
several drivers and qualities of the Resilience 

Framework. These are emblematic projects to 
advance the city vision.
– Supporting: initiatives that complement or expand 
a featured initiative.
– Specific: ideas, projects, programs or actions to 
achieve one or more goals.

The second criterion has to do with the initiative 
scope. Thus, initiatives can be classified as follows:
– Study: document that delves into a theme or 
contains recommendations aimed at taking some 
specific action to solve a problem.
– Plan: high level planning. Document that depicts 
general goals and defines the programs or actions 
to achieve them.
– Program: intermediary level planning. It includes 
projects and actions to be carried out in a specific 
area or sector.
– Project: operational level planning. Concrete 
measure to make a specific action come true.
– Institution: creation of a space, an institution or 
organization with specific functions within the 
government (for example, city organ/body, work team).

The list of initiatives includes some programs 
existing in the “Santa Fe 2020” Plan, which have 
been enriched by a resilience lens, as well as some 
new projects based on the participatory work and 
the surveys previously carried out to come up with 
better solutions for the detected challenges.

Strategy aS 
an eCoSySteM

A resilient approach advocates holistic analysis 
and aims to incorporate the opinion of different 
stakeholders to find more effective solutions to 
problems. It is upon this premise that the city 
developed the concept of the Resilience Strategy as 
an ecosystem, where initiatives are interrelated and 
share some common ground and actions. 
The next picture illustrates this interrelation 
among the four Strategy pillars. Each pillar has 
its own goals; and although initiatives are specific 
to each pillar, they can also help achieve the goals 
of other pillars. For this reason, the more holistic 
initiatives are placed in these areas where the 
pillars overlap.

In next pages, each pillar’s description incorporates 
a visual that shows these links between goals 
and initiatives, reinforcing the above mentioned 
interrelations. In addition, the technical sheet for 
each initiative includes the goals addressed and the 
Resilience Framework drivers impacted.
Finally, a leader is identified for each initiative as 
well as a series of partners that can collaborate in 
the realization of actions, by helping to articulate 
resources and capacities of different public agencies 
or private and civic institutions. Such groups are 
not exhaustive nor exclusive, and other public 
agencies, businesses and institutions could join at 
any time during implementation.

PILLAR 1
EMBRACE
CHANGE

A Santa Fe that looks into the future 
and works at a metropolitan scale

P1. EMBRACE CHANGEEFGHIJKMOTHER PILLARS’GOALSSanta Fe has become increasingly vulnerable to hydro-
meteorological phenomena, and this has only been intensified by 
climate change. In recent years, the city adopted a new disaster risk 
management system as the core policy of its development plan, thus 
turning challenges into opportunities to learn. This has improved 
the city’s preparedness for future flood emergencies and has 
provided the means for the city to grow in an orderly and sustainable 
fashion. It is in recognition of these advances that the city has been 
granted several international awards.
The city must consolidate this course of action and incorporate 
new approaches and tools in order to face the challenges posed 
by the 21st century. It must also resort to prospective thinking 
when it comes to developing its plans and projects. Adapting to the 
environment rather than trying to change it is key; and this should 
translate into specific action plans to reduce risk, mitigate climate 
change impact, protect ecosystems and significantly improve waste 
management.
These challenges call for the adoption of new city management 
and planning practices that take into account the trends of 
urban concentration and conurbation seen worldwide. Santa Fe 
acknowledges this process and is ready to face the challenge. The 
metropolitan area of Greater Santa Fe is still in gestation and 
represents a turning point towards adopting a resilience-driven 
design and development practices.
The construction of big infrastructure projects –such as a port, 
an airport, road networks, industrial parks and logistics centers, 
mobility systems and waste management facilities– which bear 
direct consequences on the economic development of the region, 
calls for the adoption of innovative approaches.

This is an innovative project currently underway that 
comprises environmental care, education, flora and fauna 
protection, water risk reduction and the struggle against 
poverty. The French Facility for Global Environment (FFEM) 
contributes to the financing of this project that aims at 
turning two of the seven rainwater reservoirs located in 
the West side of the city into highly attractive green public 
spaces. This new area, to be incorporated in the urban grid 
as a protected nature reserve, will feature a plant nursery 
and walking paths around indigenous flora and fauna. The 
initiative involves resettling the families who live in flood 
prone areas, measuring and monitoring climate change 
variables, launching socio-productive ventures, organizing 
educational and awareness-rising activities and building the 
“Flood Memorial”.
Target: By 2020, Santa Fe will expand the Reserve and 
incorporate two more reservoirs located to the southwest of 
the currently protected area.

Santa Fe has a solid and sustained Disaster Risk Reduction 
policy, for which it has been granted several international 
awards such as UNISDR Campaign Role Model City and the 
United Nations Sasakawa Award. It is also a signatory to the 
2016 Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, 
which demonstrates the city’s strong commitment to confront 
climate change. It is important to consolidate and further 
encourage these actions, in order to build resilience.
Targets:
• In 2018, Santa Fe will have a local Disaster Risk 
Management Plan, in line with the new guidelines of the 
Sendai Framework, with special emphasis on educational 
and awareness-raising activities aimed at prevention;
• In 2019, Santa Fe will have an action plan to face climate

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance. 
The provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Ríos have the highest 
incidences of leptospirosis in Argentina, and the highest 
numbers of reported outbreaks and deaths per year; 
therefore, it is a high-priority public health problem at 
the regional level. This is partly due to regional climate 
conditions and frequent floods.
Mosquito-borne viral diseases, such as Dengue, Zika and 
Chikungunya, are also sources of concern, because the city 
of Santa Fe is in the vicinity of southern Brazil and Paraguay, 
two hyperendemic areas.
To deal with these challenges, the city filed a request for 
funding before the Secondary Cities Project, via the United 
States of America Embassy in Argentina. The first stage 
of the project aims at implementing a cartographic and 
satellite surveillance system and a zoonotic information 
database to improve people’s understanding of how to protect 
themselves and their pets.
Target: In 2020, the city will have maps to illustrate the 
location of waterlogged areas, host animals, vector surveillance 
stations (oviposition traps for Aedes aegypti) and vulnerable 
populations in the Vuelta del Paraguayo, Pompeya, Nueva 
Esperanza and Jesuitas neighborhoods.

It is one of the most ambitious infrastructure 
projects since the construction of the drainage 
canals and pumping stations that, decades ago, 
turned below-sea level marshes into suburban 
neighborhoods.
The Gentilly Resilience District is a combination 
of blue-green infrastructure efforts across Gentilly 
to reduce flood risk and land subsidence, and 
encourage neighborhood revitalization. It uses new 
approaches to water and land management that 
create even greater benefits, such as innovative 
flood risk reduction methods that aim to capture 
and keep storm water under control (unlike 
traditional methods that aim at keeping it behind 
dams) known as "blue and green corridors". 
Property owners can benefit from upcoming 
incentive programs, aimed at subsidizing 
improvements in energy-efficiency, storm water 
management and home elevation works.

This initiative is part of Plan Norte –a priority for the 
municipal government of Santa Fe which aims for orderly 
urban growth and the development of projects (water, road, 
services, employment, vocational training, education, health 
and housing) in order to improve residents’ quality of life. The 
Parque del Norte Project involves recovering and revitalizing 
80 hectares of land formerly used as a landfill site, the 
municipal Botanical Garden, and several derelict green 
spaces. It is also a comprehensive public-space management 
experience that takes into account environmental and 
residential aspects, as well as blue and green infrastructure 
efforts. It provides for the construction of promenades and 
sports facilities, the cleaning up of lakes and storm drains, 
the creation of a School of Labor and the enhancement of the 
district center facilities. It also aims at developing real estate 
ventures and attracting large-scale public-private investments 
to build houses and new neighborhoods already included in 
the city Urban Zoning Plan.
Santa Fe will create participatory spaces for the residents to 
engage in the urban design of the park, especially those who 
live in its vicinity.
Target: By 2020, the city will have already launched the first 
stage of the project.

The city of Santa Fe is a labor, education and health services 
center, and also has a strategic location for the logistics and 
transport of goods within the region. Thousands of people 
and vehicles travel back and forth between Santa Fe and other 
cities on a daily basis. Due to the demographic growth of the 
neighboring cities and the increased number of road vehicles, 
some gaps in the mobility system have clearly emerged. 
Greater Santa Fe needs a mobility plan that takes into 
account the following variables: social and economic growth 
of the metropolitan area and its connection to the province 
of Entre Ríos, vehicular traffic in main highways and city 
access roads, the location of key infrastructure works in the 
islands and swamp areas, transport systems and railway 
network in the region. It should also discourage the use of 
private cars and encourage the adoption of healthier habits 
such as cycling and walking, as well as the incorporation of 
technology to ease traffic flows and reduce pollution.
Target: By 2019, Santa Fe will count on a comprehensive 
Mobility Plan for the Greater Santa Fe.

Some of the challenges the city of Santa Fe has to face are 
originated beyond the city borders, for example, urban 
solid waste management, mobility, flood risk reduction 
and housing problems. In line with the city’s approach 
to governance, these challenges are addressed from a 
metropolitan viewpoint so as to cooperatively manage and 
promote sustainable and orderly territorial development, and 
an efficient public service network. 
Nowadays, both the national and provincial governments 
support the creation of metropolitan areas in the country. 
But sometimes these new institutions cannot work properly 
because it is difficult to define the management model, due 
to the large number of different interests and government 
levels involved in the definition process. In September 2016, 
the ECOM was created pursuant to the regulations set forth 
in Provincial Act N° 13 532. It has already received funding 
from the IDB to draft the metropolitan strategic guidelines. 
Targets: Set ECOM into operation with the budget allocation 
for this purpose, and create a qualified technical team to 
develop projects; hold 4 round tables between 2017 and 2018 
to foster resilience-driven project development.

Santa Fe and its metropolitan area have identified a series 
of strategic works for development that have strong support 
from the different political and productive sectors, and civil 
society. A port, an airport, bridges and roads, industrial and 
technology parks, and logistics are all part of this collection of 
large-scale works that will have a huge impact on employment 
growth and economic development of the city and the 
region. In order to assess the feasibility of these projects, find 
funding sources and define the sequence of execution, Santa 
Fe must first systematize and record information about the 
condition of each project. This means working jointly with 
ECOM to produce a work plan that comprises a description 
of every project being publicly debated with the same level 
of analysis, including its socio-economic and environmental 
impact, a cost-benefit evaluation, and an analysis of its 
synergistic operation capacity.
Target: In 2 years’ time, Santa Fe will have a roadmap for the 
development of large socio-productive infrastructure works 
in Greater Santa Fe.

The cities of Santa Fe and Paraná have two small, poorly 
performing airports. Both city mayors, with the support 
of the national government, have reached consensus to 
build a bigger metropolitan airport for both domestic and 
international flights. This strategic asset for the city and 
the region would not only boost the economy but also 
logistics and tourism. The plan is to build the airport at an 
equidistant point from the two cities, in the Paraná River 
island and swamp area. Although the City Building Code 
prevents this area from being urbanized, it allows for the 
construction of logistics and infrastructure projects.
The objective of this initiative is to promote and monitor the 
development of a preliminary design for the metropolitan 
airport, ensure that the project considers local interests, and 
incorporate a resilience focus in its design.
Target: By 2018, Santa Fe will have created a bi-provincial

Due to its strategic location, the city of Santa Fe is a natural 
logistics center for productive regions in Argentina and the 
Southern Cone. Agro-Industry and Bio-economy sectors are 
among those businesses with the highest growth potential. 
The national government launched the Belgrano Plan and 
made investments in infrastructure to reactivate the railway 
transport system in the center and north of the country. Both 
the city and the province of Santa Fe have also developed 
different logistics and transport projects, currently underway, 
such as the relocation of the port facilities to an area along the 
main channel of the river, or the multimodal logistics park 
called Inter-Puertos. This initiative aims at drafting a plan to 
define sector priorities, regulate the execution of the projects 
and analyze sources of investment and finance.

The city of Santa Fe has a new Urban Planning Code, 
approved in 2010, which provides for an orderly and planned 
use of the territory. However, many of the urban challenges 
faced by Santa Fe transcend the city borders. For example, 
many young people who study and work in Santa Fe had to 
move to smaller neighboring cities –San José del Rincón, 
Arroyo Leyes and Recreo–, due to Santa Fe city’s soaring real 
estate prices. This translates into an increased demand of 
housing and public services, and poses some environmental 
risks related to solid waste and wastewater management.
Most of the towns and cities located in Santa Fe metropolitan 
area either do not have an urban planning code yet or are 
still in the process of drafting one; therefore, it is essential 
to work together and reach a consensus on criteria regarding 
the orderly use of the territory shared by different cities.

will have established a common land use code for the 
metropolitan area.

integrated ManageMent

Urban solid waste management is one of the most serious 
challenges faced by the city of Santa Fe. The current landfill 
site opened in 2010 and has an estimated lifespan of 5 to 
7 years. The city allocates a large amount of human and 
monetary resources to urban solid waste (USW) collection 
and disposal, and garbage dump control activities. The 
city has launched a waste segregation plan and different 
composting and recycling activities, with different levels of 
compliance and participation according to the neighborhood. 
The work of informal waste collectors does not only pose 
a risk to the health of the 600 families that make a living 
out of waste picking, but also to the environment and the 
community at large. 
The city wants to make a qualitative leap forward in the 
field of urban waste management by implementing Circular 
Green Economy models, not only to find a solution to social 
and environmental problems but also to foster a model of 
economic development, social inclusion and community 
engagement.
Target: In 2018, the city will have a Green and Circular 
Economy roadmap and, especially an integrated USW 
management plan.

Waste generation and disposal have increased lately in 
Santa Fe and its surrounding areas. The measures taken 
to improve waste segregation, composting and recycling 
practices did not have the expected positive impact. Besides, 
the lack of effective mechanisms to control the waste 
collection system results in its poor performance. 
Landfill sites, which have an estimated lifespan of 5 to 7 
years, have become old-fashioned and obsolete options. 
Although studies have been conducted to see if said lifespan 
can be extended, the city needs a wider range of options to 
find a definitive solution to this problem.
Santa Fe wants to establish a pilot zone to assess the impact 
of measures aimed at reducing waste generation and at 
improving waste sorting, such as: analysis and assessment of 
waste segregation practices, redefinition of sorting methods, 
definition of “benchmarks” and performance indicators, 
door-to-door awareness-raising campaigns, improvement and 
control of the waste collection service, and analysis of results.
Target: In 2018, the city will count on an efficient method to 
reduce USW generation.

In the city of Santa Fe, there are approximately 600 families 
that make a living out of garbage and waste collection. They 
segregate and classify garbage in precarious, unsafe and 
unhealthy conditions; they also accumulate rubbish in mini 
garbage dumps and set large amounts of garbage on fire. The 
situation gets even worse because there are child scavengers. 
Sometimes the garbage ends up clogging the drainage 
system, thus increasing the risk of flooding.
Santa Fe has launched a program that aims at improving 
scavengers’ work conditions and at offering them a decent 
and sustainable alternative to this activity. The situation of 
each family is assessed; and after a diagnosis is reached, 
a multidisciplinary work team proposes healthier work 
alternatives either related to the garbage or any other social 
economy sector. Although it has proved to be successful so 
far, this program needs to be consolidated and reinforced.
Target: By 2022, the number of informal waste collectors 
in the city will be reduced by 50%, thanks to this inclusive 
process of opportunity generation.

A Santa Fe that grows with equity and 
guarantees access to basic services.

P2. CONNECT TO OPPORTUNITIESACHIJKOTHER PILLARS’GOALSSanta Fe aspires to become a land of opportunity, offering its 
residents the tools and resources they need to grow both personally 
and collectively in a safe, inclusive and equitable environment. 
The city’s poverty rate is similar to the national average, and 
inequity becomes more evident in those neighborhoods with 
higher rates of unemployment or unregistered employment, more 
problems with housing or basic public services, and greater risk 
of flooding. These challenges must be tackled in a comprehensive 
manner; and vulnerable populations, especially younger residents, 
should be given more opportunities to grow.
In order to foster equitable growth and overcome social exclusion, 
the city must boost those economic sectors that have a higher 
development potential to grow and create jobs.
One of the most serious stresses our city faces is access to 
safe and affordable housing, followed by a housing deficit and 
squatter settlements in low-lying areas at greater risk of flooding. 
Santa Fe must develop community-building projects –not only 
housing solutions– with an integrated approach to physical 
and social interventions, in order to build healthy and inclusive 
neighborhoods.
Finally, it is imperative to optimize interventions of the State to be

According to the Permanent Household Survey (PHS), 
around 18,000 Santafesinians aged between 18 and 25 
come from low social-class backgrounds in terms of average 
income per capita. These people are excluded from the socio-
educational and socio-productive fabric, and have limited 
access to social safety nets. Therefore, they find it very 
difficult to find a job and are thus more likely to fall into the 
trap of illegal economic activities.
The Santa Fe Government has launched an ambitious 
program called Schools of Labor, which offers highly 
vulnerable young people assistance to finish school, find a job, 
buy their first home and have access to social safety nets. The 
tools offered by these schools are grouped into five categories: 
education; vocational training and employment mediation, 
self-employment and entrepreneurship; first-time home 
acquisition; access to culture, sports and health activities; and 
promotion of rights to improve coexistence.
So far this program has proved to be successful – it has been 
implemented in one neighborhood and two new communities, 
and the first building of its own is currently under 
construction. The city wants to consolidate and reinforce this 
experience so as to reach out and help more people.
Target: By 2025, Schools of Labor will have offered opportunities 
to half of their potential beneficiaries, and will have built two 
new, top-quality buildings of their own located in Jardín Botánico 
and La Tablada, favoring two districts that feature the largest 
number of young people with inclusion problems.

PLAN / SuPPORTING

15. youth poliCieS

The Municipality has developed various activities and 
programs for the youth of the city. It is necessary to move 
towards a comprehensive plan that orders and integrates 
these actions, involving young people in the design of 
activities as responsible actors and beneficiaries of the 
growth of the city in which they live.
Therefore, this initiative proposes the creation of a Municipal 
Youth Plan that integrates all educational activities, 
cultural and athletic activities, job training and assistance, 
access to technology, mobility and the environment in 
order to improve the impact of these policies and generate 
opportunities for different groups of young people.
The Plan will provide tools for the autonomous and 
sustainable development of young people and assistance in 
building their identity, seeking to activate participation and 
commitment to the city, as well as to modify risk behaviours 
and develop a culture of peace. It will have differentiated 
mechanisms that recognize diverse realities and problems, 
as well as personalized, integral and multidisciplinary 
accompaniment tools. The Plan should contemplate specific 
actions for the inclusion of young people in situations of 
extreme vulnerability, with problems of addiction and / or in 
conflict with criminal law.
Target: By 2019, Santa Fe will have developed the Municipal 
Youth Plan, in collaboration with the city’s youth.

INSPIRATION

For over 7 years now, Santa Fe Municipality has been 
working hard –with the support of the provincial and 
national governments– to move families settled in low-lying 
areas at greater risk of flooding to safer areas with access to 
basic public services. On many occasions, these measures 
were taken within the framework of Comprehensive Urban 
Programs (CUP), in an attempt to adopt a comprehensive 
approach to habitat improvement.
In 2016, for the first time in 8 years, the city received funding 
by the national government to build 280 houses. This plan, 
currently underway in the Nueva Esperanza Este, Vuelta 
del Paraguayo and Jesuitas neighborhoods, will be the first 
large-scale response to this kind of problem since the projects 
implemented after the Salado River overflow in 2003. The 
IIED gathered input from the community and stakeholders, 
identified weaknesses and strengths of the resettlement process, 
and underlined the need to improve community social support 
services. Thus, this initiative aims to conduct a pilot plan in 
one of the aforementioned neighborhoods to improve social 
interventions through the adoption of a resilient approach.
Targets:
• During 2017 and 2018, Santa Fe will devise tools to foster 
further engagement of families living in Vuelta del Paraguayo 
with the resettlement and neighborhood improvement process;
• In 2020, the city will have established a social management 
methodology that will integrate the different state levels, to 
offer families social safety services and to drive community 
development.

Uncoordinated intervention in Santa Fe by different State 
agencies has taken its toll. There are a huge number of 
programs, plans and actions to deal with social stresses, 
which separately have proved to be insufficient and hardly 
ever successful in improving the situations of vulnerable 
communities. 
This initiative aims to implement a pilot project to 
coordinate the operation of different municipal agencies and 
bureaus in a specific neighborhood. A neighborhood, where 
a CUP (Comprehensive Urban Program) and a Resettlement 
Program of families living in water-risk areas are currently 
underway, will be selected and social habitat management 
practices will be introduced into these projects.
A work space and methodology will be created that facilitate 
coordinated intervention in the territory in order to prevent 
unnecessary duplication of resources and action overlapping, 
and to optimize the use of existing information and the 
assessment of policy outcomes. Participatory activities are 
envisaged to foster community engagement in the process.
Target: In 2018, the Municipality will hold at least 10 meetings 
with different municipal agencies and bureaus in order to devise 
a specific intervention plan and coordinate its implementation. 
Indicators will also be defined to assess the results.

Affordable housing problems affect both low-income and 
middle-income groupsin the city. When renting a property, 
there may be some barriers such as get a legal demonstrable 
salary or find a guarantor. As a consequence of this, there 
is an illegal real estate market, where rents are higher and 
tenants have no rights or protection whatsoever. 
This initiative aims to tackle this problem by offering 
protection and legal counsel to families in this predicament. 
It will offer other options too, namely: new home equity 
loans, loans to buy construction materials, training 
regarding household finances and economics, DIY 
construction, and new building technologies.
Target: In 4 years, the first social real estate office will be

CUPs comprise a set of comprehensive interventions in 
specific city areas. Inspired by the Medellin (Colombia) 
experience, these programs advance infrastructure efforts 
(expansion of services network, housing improvement, 
public space revitalization), stronger institutional presence 
(diverse tools contributed by municipal and other agencies at 
different state levels), social policies aimed at neighborhood 
integration, opportunity creation and citizen engagement.
In 2012, Santa Fe successfully implemented these 
programs in three areas (Barranquitas, Noreste and Santa 
Rosa de Lima), thus increasing people’s access to basic 
services and reducing squatter settlements. In 2016, the 
city extended this program to 9 more neighborhoods 
thanks to the National Habitat Plan, a plan with similar 
guidelines launched by the National Government to fund 
comprehensive neighborhood improvement initiatives. 
Target: By 2022, Santa Fe will have improved people’s access 
to basic services networks in all the neighborhoods located 
in the southwest and west districts, and will implement 
two CUPs in the northwest and coastal districts. The city 
will jointly work with the Social Innovation Cabinet and the 
Social Real Estate Agency, which are regarded as auxiliary

To meet their requirements, specific understanding and

currently have.
Thus, the city wants to create teams to address basic social 
needs. These teams will be multidisciplinary and will help 
these communities deal with their problems and seize 
opportunities to find a way out of marginality. These teams 
will also offer prompt and effective responses and support in

Master Plan, the local government has launched a Sanitary 
Sewer Network Expansion Plan to serve 150,000 more people. 
These are key projects that will improve the quality of life of 
the most vulnerable communities and minimize sanitary 
risk factors, but their execution is long overdue. The plan 
envisions a system of shared and charitable financing. 
The current national administration has dedicated funds to 
expand this service coverage. For this reason, this initiative 
aims to implement the plan’s projects and search for sources 
of financing.
Target: In 10 years, the sanitary sewer network in Santa Fe 
will serve 100% of the households across District 1 to District

P3. FOSTER CIVIC ENGAGEMENTDELOTHER PILLARS’GOALSSanta Fe wants to strengthen the community’s sense of 
belonging and encourage citizens to engage with their 
environment, which has been seriously affected by widespread 
practices that do not comply with city rules and show great 
disregard for public community assets. The rate of violence in the 
city is far higher than the national average; thus in order to deter 
illegal activities and informal behavior, coexistence principles 
and a culture of peace must be embraced.
Concepts such as looking after public spaces, understanding 
risk, and showing respect for life, animals and the environment 
are key aspects of building an inclusive community. Those same 
concepts were mentioned repeatedly by stakeholders throughout 
the consultation process prior to strategy development. 
Citizen engagement and access to information are essential to 
healthy coexistence and the consolidation of democracy. The 
development of local leadership and active community participation 
is also necessary to co-design solutions to urban problems; in short, 
the goal is to advocate for people’s right to the city.
Intermediary institutions are key allies in articulating the 
government-community relationship. Santa Fe has significant 
institutional and social capacity for generating new and 
innovative ideas; this capacity should be strengthened through 
new communication channels in order to propel the growth of 
the city and the consolidation of its identity. To become a more 
resilient city, Santa Fe must once again embrace key values such as 
education and hard work, and must recover its capacity to engage 
in new projects and overcome obstacles, two typical Santafesinian 
features. It must also support the acquisition of knowledge and 
new technologies to build resilience.

The city is a dynamic ecosystem where different actors –civil 
society, academia, the private sector and the government– 
interact and relate to each other based on their needs and 
interests. The City Government must further promote 
collaborative work and facilitate the exchange of knowledge 
to improve public policies.
This initiative aims to strengthen these interactions to 
capitalize on the capacities the city already has and to 
encourage the co-creation of solutions to different challenges.
The City Hall will act as a link between the parties and carry 
out the following actions: first, it will create a database with 
updated information about knowledge and projects mastered by 
different sectors; then, it will analyze other experiences currently 
underway such as the Centre for the Transfer of Research 
Results - UNL university, the International Office of the UTN 
university, the Capital Forum for Innovation, and the Social 
Organizations Forum, among others; and finally, it will organize 
meetings to exchange and co-develop projects for the city.
The city will also enter into agreements with different 
universities to conduct research on priority themes for 
the Resilience Strategy. It will also build links between 
production of knowledge (science), production of goods 
(industry), entrepreneurs (ideas) and investors (funding). 
Target: In 2018, Santa Fe will have created a list of

common problems. Outreach projects articulate different 
research, training and awareness-raising activities, which are 
very important to the city government to the extent that they 
tackle city problems.
The city will enter into a cooperation agreement with UNL

This initiative aims to promote volunteer work among 
young people to foster engagement in problem solving 
actions, community integration and respect for coexistence 
rules. This program also aims to strengthen civil society 
organizations that have volunteers, and to link solidarity 
practices with resilience initiatives. 
There is a network of humanitarian aid institutions in 
the city that play a very active role in emergencies and 
humanitarian crises. Two of the most outstanding are the 
Red Cross and Caritas, which are in charge of providing 
first aid and primary care, and organizing clothes and food 
collections, respectively. 
In particular, this program aims to build on people’s 
capacities to organize different activities, for example: in 
the case of young people, awareness-raising campaigns on 
waste sorting; in the case of professionals, financial and legal 
counsel for low-income families; and in the case of elderly 
adults, experience-sharing activities with children and

BarCelona aCtiVa
Barcelona (Spain)

This organization has been working hard for 
30 years to promote the economic growth and 
development of Barcelona and improve its 
residents’ quality of life, by fostering employment 
and entrepreneurship and offering companies 
support through the lens of plural, social and 
solidarity economy. 
Barcelona Activa is a strong entrepreneurship 
advocate that offers support to those who want 
to set up a sustainable company, through the 
organization of training activities and assistance 
in the search for sources of finance and other 
resources. It also counts on incubators where start-
ups can develop and consolidate while sharing a 
space with other companies.

The city of Santa Fe has the potential to develop touristic, 
creative, gastronomic and technological ventures. These are 
significant sectors because they create jobs or self-employment 
opportunities and have high prospects of success. 
This initiative aims to strengthen existing programs and 
launch new ones, within the framework of the recently 
passed Entrepreneurship Act. Since 2012, there has been a 
Center for Social Economy Entrepreneurs in Santa Fe that 
works jointly with the UNL and the provincial government. 
In 2016, different clusters began to consolidate, namely the 
beer production, ICT and design clusters.
Through this initiative, the city wants to strengthen existing 
actions and start new ones, taking advantage of a national 
entrepreneurship act recently passed. Thus, different social 
economy ventures will be surveyed, many of which are 
funded by the national government, to explore consolidation 
strategies. Strategic development plans for each sector will 
be jointly drafted with potential entrepreneurs, academia, 
the private sector and the State. Finally, training activities 
and events to promote this entrepreneurial spirit will be 
organized. Support will be granted to those interested 
in starting up companies, launching business plans and 
incubating projects.
Target: In 5 years, Santa Fe will have strengthened the Center 
for Entrepreneurs and will have more entrepreneurs and 
projects. It will also have strategic plans, training activities 
and special events aimed at the ICT and beer sectors.

Byblos (Lebanon)

Byblos has a long history of economic activity linked to 
traditional crafts, agriculture/horticulture and fishing 
activities. It also has a unique architectural heritage, 
which constitutes a special setting for the mass media, 
digital media and movie-making industries. Thus, 
the city promotes the creation of clusters to foster the 
development of these industries and make the most 
out of existing networks and partnerships.
The city aims to offer targeted industries some 
logistics and communication services, and also 
build a local knowledge-and-skill sector to foster 
research and innovation linked to the said targeted 
industries. Byblos also plans to create incubators 
for the development of new projects in the fields of 
creativity and health care, two of the city’s strengths.

The emblematic building of the so-called Mercado Progreso 
was built in 1925 and was derelict for many years. In 2010, 
the city government decided to revitalize the building, 
starting with its facade, and launched a program to do so.
Every weekend, the market hosts different activities: a fair 
called “Diseña Santa Fe”, live music shows, beer festivals and 
other cultural events. Artists and local entrepreneurs are 
truly fond of Mercado Progreso, which is regarded as an ideal 
place for the promotion of creative industries.
This initiative will launch a public-private partnership to 
restore the rest of the building and set up creative ventures. 
For these creative ventures, this initiative will capitalize on 
the findings of the European Commission’s project called 
“Strengthening Design MSMEs in the city of Santa Fe and the 
Region”, within the framework of the Al-Invest 5.0 Program.
Some of the actions to be implemented include: searching 
for funding sources for the construction work, the selection 
of creative entrepreneurial ventures to be allotted a space 
in the building, and the creation of a management entity, 
among others. 
Target: By 2026, Mercado Progreso will be fully restored and 
spaces will have been allotted to entrepreneurs.

The Resilience Strategy development process clearly showed 
that Santa Fe residents are bursting with great ideas to 
solve the challenges their city faces. However, the activities 
during the consultation process were organized for people 
to participate in person, and the number of attendees was 
relatively low compared to the city’s population. 
Thus, Santa Fe wants to create a modern virtual 
communication channel, in line with the technological 
possibilities of the 21st century, to ensure massive 
participation and receive more ideas to tackle current 
and future challenges. This marks a new way of 
institutionalizing citizens’ participation in the public policy 
making process.
To achieve this, a project will be developed
in close collaboration with the ICT cluster, made up of some 
IT and communication companies that actively work with 
the city government. Work with neighbors’ associations and 
NGOs will be completed, and pilot plans to co-create projects 
will be implemented. 
Target: In 2 years, Santa Fe will have established an online 
platform where the city government will share challenges 
and projects, and citizens will be able to share ideas and even 
partner with the city to analyze and tackle stresses.

There are around 50,000 graduate and postgraduate 
students in the 3 universities in the city. Every year students, 
tutors and research centers pick subject matters to develop 
their final theses. On many occasions, the selected topic is 
hardly related to the challenges the city faces; on others, the 
projects remain in the academic environment and do not 
reach out to technical departments within State agencies. 
The Government of the city of Santa Fe aims to reverse this 
situation, and thus proposes that students from different 
university programs write their final thesis or project about 
challenges the city and its metropolitan area face and their 
possible solutions. 
To this end, every year the City Hall, together with local 
universities, will invite applications from students to present 
research projects on urban resilience. Finally, a ceremony 
will be held to announce the winning project, present 
posters and grant its authors an award.
Target: In 2019, Santa Fe will have 20 final theses about city

Santa Fe is proud to be the birthplace of the National 
Constitution, the Magna Carta that contains the sets of 
political principles by which our modern Argentina is 
governed was signed in our city. Thus, the City Government, 
inspired by the Medellin experience, started to build a Library-
Park. It is a public space devoted to education and culture, 
a place for gathering to reflect on our national history; a 
place that reaffirms the values and rights stipulated in our 
Constitution and strengthens our local identity.
The urban and architectural design of the building was 
selected in a public tender process and reflects the new 
paradigms of the 21st century, namely: environment, 
ecology and urban-social inclusion. The park is located in an 
privileged, previously derelict, natural environment by the 
river, and offers city residents from vulnerable neighborhoods 
a new public space where they can enjoy the river landscape. 
The Museum of the Constitution is expected to open in 
2017. Different cultural and recreational activities will 
be organized to attract neighbors in the vicinity and city 
residents at large to this new place.
Further, the city will incentivize the creation of service 
ventures to assist people and students who visit the museum.

and life, and knowledge co-creation is a major driver of innovative 
solutions to urban problems. 
Santa Fe aspires to become a modern, intelligent city. In the last 
few years, the municipality has implemented different programs 
to upgrade and enhance systems, and to improve administrative 
procedures and community services. It has also worked jointly 
with other civil society institutions to design quality-of-life and 
management indicators to assess public policies. 
However, these processes are far from being fully put to effective 
use. Different city departments and agencies generate, save and 
share information in a compartmentalized fashion, using different 
data-recording criteria and fragile institutional repositories, which 
makes it more difficult for information to be publicly used. Such 
is also the case with the programs for controlling and monitoring 
infrastructure systems, either because their components are 
technologically obsolete, or because they are handled by too many 
agencies and companies.
The challenge is to turn this weakness into an opportunity to 
generate new knowledge-management systems and incorporate 
new technology, sponsoring research into specific stresses and 
developing evidence-based projects. Efforts are being made to 
advance towards an open government that guarantees transparent 
management and collaborative work with the community.
The city of Santa Fe also aims to become a pioneer in the field of 
resilience, and use this approach to urban design and city growth 
in the region.

it is even thrice. Urban violence is deeply rooted in young 
male populations of certain vulnerable neighborhoods. It 
is essential to better understand the causes and improve 
policies at different government levels in order to reduce 
the rates of violence. These problems should be analyzed 
from a multidisciplinary perspective to assess the impact of 
different actions currently underway by local, province and

Performance is not uniform across infrastructure systems 
in the city. In order to plan and develop projects and find 
funding sources, it is essential to survey the infrastructure 
systems’ condition and check that they operate at the 
required current and future performance levels.
This initiative will create a “report card” to survey 
infrastructure in city neighborhoods and districts. This 
report will be an annual statement about infrastructure 
performance based on data analysis, expert surveys and 
residents’ opinions. The following aspects will be taken 
into account: financing, operation and maintenance, 
public safety, innovation and resilience qualities such as 
redundancy and integration.
Target: In 2020, Santa Fe will have created a Report Card to 
assess the performance of the infrastructure systems managed 
by the Municipality.

PROGRAM / FEATuRED

MCSF allocates part of its annual budget to operation and 
maintenance of the urban drainage system. Additionally, 
pursuant to the Storm Drainage Master Plan developed by 
the National Water Institute, which is regularly upgraded, 
the City Hall keeps investing toward its completion. In 2016, 
thanks to a joint effort by the City Hall and the provincial and 
national governments, AR$ 1 billion worth of investment was 
allocated for new works - 10% of this investment was provided 
by the city government.
Drainage systems are costly but ‘hardly visible’ to residents, 
because pipes are buried. Thus, this initiative will adopt a 
new paradigm for the design of the urban drainage system 
components, not only to enhance their performance but 
also to help residents embrace the idea of living with water. 
This initiative will adopt new approaches to solve drainage 
problems while improving public space, by designing not 
only drainage pipelines but also other mechanisms or 
systems to retain and reuse water.
Targets:
• As of 2018, Santa Fe will incorporate green infrastructure 
in all of its stormwater management projects;
• As of 2020, urban public spaces will be designed with 
integrated drainage systems, in order to increase their visibility 
and raise awareness of their significance to the city.

in downtown Santa Fe

In downtown Santa Fe, like in many other older cities, there 
are government buildings, schools, banks, shops, offices and 
houses; the downtown is a key area in the city’s social and 
economic life. Infrastructure systems here, and especially in 
the area around downtown, are obsolete and have not been 
regularly upgraded, so their level of performance already is 
or will be very low in the near future. 
This initiative will develop a program to upgrade infrastructure 
in order to optimize resources and to prevent long and 
frequent periods of infrastructure disruption. This means 
surveying existing plans, updating information and studies, 
adopting new technologies, using new materials, installing 
underground wiring, modifying the public space (streets 
and pavement) pursuant to the Mobility Plan guidelines and 
making provisions for the construction of tall buildings. 
The regulations in force will be analyzed to help create new 
regulations and seek funding to advance the program.
Every state agency and private company providing services 
in this area must make a contribution, including the 
Coordinating Body for Infrastructure Projects.
Target: In 4 years, Santa Fe will have started the 
implementation for this program.

The new urban challenges of the 21st century test the 
response capacity of local governments. Traditional 
government structures are unable to deal with these new 
challenges, which are very complex and lack a clear cut 
division between causes and effects. Nowadays, there 
is no single action that can solve every challenge cities 
face, but it is possible to coordinate actions and adopt 
a multidisciplinary approach to tackle more than one 
challenge at once. Inspired by the innovative nature of the 
participatory workshops organized through out the resilience 
strategy development process, the MCSF will replicate these 
spaces for the accelerated design of projects and initiatives to 
tackle complex challenges.
Target: By 2018, Santa Fe will have held 3 meetings to be 
attended by different secretariats, to discuss and design 
projects to tackle complex city challenges in an innovative 
fashion.

One of the most frequent problems encountered by local 
governments is the lack of human resources needed to 
carry out strategic analysis and planning, and to turn ideas 
into detailed-enough projects eligible to be funded and 
implemented.
Thus, this initiative will create a multidisciplinary work 
team to identify neglected areas of research, conduct studies 
and develop projects and indicators to enhance government 
performance. This team will also conduct an economic 
analysis to design new financing alternatives (bonds, private-
public ventures) or improve existing ones (loans, taxes, etc.).
Target: In 2 years, Santa Fe will have this team in place and 
will have allocated funds for its operation.

PROGRAM / SPECIFIC

In 2012, the city of Santa Fe launched its Municipal Early 
Childhood Education System. So far, it has opened 16 
municipal kindergartens in the city’s most vulnerable 
neighborhoods, which currently serve 2,000 children aged 1 
to 3. This policy, which regards education as a right and has 
a gender-based approach, has been awarded recognition by 
many institutions such as CIPPEC in Argentina; and most 
recently by the World Organization for Early Childhood 
Education (OMEP) and the UNESCO’s Education for 
Sustainable Development Prize and Skills in Action Award. 
To take advantage of this strength, this initiative will use 
municipal kindergartens as labs to promote the Resilience 
Framework from early childhood. It will also introduce this 
approach in the Girls and Boys Council, created in 2008, 
where children aged 8 to 11 can discuss and develop ideas to 
improve the city. 
Target: In 2 years, the city will have incorporated resilience 
thematic modules in:
• Municipal kindergartens curricula;
• Resilience training activities aimed at kindergarten 
teachers in vulnerable neighborhoods;
• Girls and Boys Council meetings.

deal with increasing and unequal urbanization. 
The City of Santa Fe, in its capacity as Chair of the 
Mercociudades Network for 2017, proposes that the network 
enter into a strategic agreement with 100RC to advance the 
School of Resilience initiative, which is a set of modules 
aimed at providing local governments from both networks 
with training. 
The goal is to promote mutual learning and exchanges, and 
help governments develop and implement urban resilience 
development plans and strategies. Thus, training modules 
will be specifically designed and aimed at senior officials 
involved in city decision-making and strategic-planning 
processes so that they adopt a resilient approach to local

Santa Fe, a regional 
reSilienCe pioneer

In the past few years, the city of Santa Fe has played a very 
active role and shown strong commitment to different 
international networks, thus becoming a regional 
leader that strives for more active participation of local 
governments in the global agenda. It has also promoted 
the adoption of multidisciplinary approaches, such as 
resilience, in order to innovate urban development. Since 
2012, the city of Santa Fe has supported the UNISDR 
Making Cities Resilient campaign. It was granted the 
“City Role Model” status, and its mayor was appointed 
“Champion of UNISDR’s Making Cities Resilient 
Campaign”. It signed the Global Covenant of Mayors for 
Climate and Energy; domestically, it became a member of 
the Argentine Network of Municipalities against Climate 
Change (RAMCC). 
In 2015, the city joined the 100RC program and that 
same year, it was unanimously elected Chair of the 
Mercociudades Network  for the 2016-2017 period, in 
recognition of its active participation and commitment. 

The work plan put forward by Santa Fe for this term 
focuses on: “Building Resilient Societies within the 
Framework of Regional Integration”. The same title 
was also the motto of the international event held by 
the city in 2016 - the 21st Mercociudades Summit, the 
network’s most important annual meeting. 
Within this framework, the city launched Santa Fe’s 
Statement on Resilience, a document that was signed by 
representatives from cities in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
Colombia, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela. 
This document urges local governments to promote a 
comprehensive approach to resilient societies, which 
goes beyond disaster risk management. 
In 2017, Santa Fe’s Statement on Resilience was also 
presented in both the Regional and Global Disaster Risk 
Reduction Platforms of Cancun and Montreal, where 
the city once again claimed the need to strengthen and 
empower local governments as key actors in the search 
for solutions to community problems.

Local government networks play a key role in cities’ learning 
processes by incentivizing them to adopt new and innovative 
development paradigms. Thus, the 100RC network –a 
program that connects CROs and resilience advocates– has 
given us the chance not only to learn about other experiences 
but also contribute to a more resilient world. This invaluable 
tool has provided Santa Fe with knowledge about other cities 
facing the same challenges, which has been a source of 
inspiration to launch different initiatives and to take a more 
active role in the dissemination of this innovative approach 
within the region.

Santa Fe asked Arup to carry out an Analysis of 
Integrated Management of Urban Solid Waste 
in Santa Fe (IMUSW); a Survey of Sources of 
Finance for Infrastructure, Housing and Tourism 
Projects; and an Assessment of the Vulnerable 
Families’ Resettlement Process in the city of Santa 
Fe. For the last study, Arup worked jointly with 
the International Institute for Environment and 
Development, IIED – Latin America.

IMUSW objectives:
• Identify world trends in integrated management 
of urban solid waste (IMUSW).
• Identify successful, unsuccessful and innovative 
IMUSW experiences, from which Santa Fe can 
learn lessons.
• Identify successful and/or innovative mechanisms 
to reduce waste, especially household waste. 

The objective of the Survey of Sources of Finance 
for Infrastructure, Housing and Tourism Projects, 
was to find multilateral and national funding to:

greater risk of flooding.
• Build social housing in safe, non-flood prone areas.
• Carry out maintenance of the services 
infrastructure network to ensure/improve its 
performance.
• Expand the aforementioned network to enlarge the 
number of city districts with access to basic services.

The objective of the Assessment of the Vulnerable 
Families’ Resettlement Process in the city of 
Santa Fe was to collect affected families’ opinions 
about the resettlement process through surveys 
and questionnaires, in order to improve future 
interventions of this kind. It aims to identify if 
there were changes in these communities’ living 
conditions, and to pinpoint positive aspects worth 
reinforcing and negative aspects that must be revised.

key ReCoMMeNDATioNS
Recommendations on IMUSW:
• Develop clear and relevant rules.
• Identify current failures and set performance goals.
• Identify institutions and human resources that 
can work jointly with Santa Fe in awareness-raising 
activities.
• Select pilot zones to assess methodologies and 
outcomes.

As for Sources of Finance, a list was delivered with 
the names of different institutions such as: the 
World Bank, International Finance Corporation, 
Inter-American Development Bank, Latin 
American Development Bank and several different 
national and provincial Ministries.

As for resettlement processes:
 • Develop communication strategies between 
the different actors involved in the resettlement 
process, so that both resettled families and 
residents in general will be acquainted with every 
aspect of the process, including options, schedules, 
roles, responsibilities, and the origin of funds.
• Discuss and increase the number of resettlement 
options, including families’ voluntary withdrawal 
from their community and random resettlement in 
different city areas. This means analyzing different 
options such as buying used homes, swapping or 
bartering homes, etc.
• Incorporate collaborative actions in the 
resettlement process as soon as possible, and 
develop strategies to sustain them over time. 
• Discuss and reach consensus on different sources 
of finance to improve and enlarge homes; consider 
micro-credit systems to buy materials, since they 
contribute to strengthening the social fabric and 
increasing community responsibility.
• Discuss and reach consensus on reusing 
recovered lands for community purposes, and on 
using land with environmental, recreational and 
productive purposes to the benefit of Santa Fe’s 
residents and especially resettled families.
• Create labor opportunities and alternative means 
of sustenance for resettled populations that 
bring environmental benefits to every citizen, for 
example, reservoir and green space protectors.

The City of Santa Fe has taken an important step 
towards urban resilience. The Resilience Strategy 
–and its development process– has been enriching 
to the city, its institutions and population. Now, 
Santafesinians can look to concrete actions aimed at 
turning Santa Fe into a dynamic and thriving city, 
a city that spearheads regional development and 
creates opportunities for all within a framework 
of peaceful and harmonic coexistence among its 
residents and with the environment. 
Ten initiatives in the Santa Fe 2020 Development 
Plan are currently underway, and their positive 
results are evident. Our goal is to reinforce these 
initiatives and launch others through the lens of 
resilience for the next 10 years to come. Many of 
them will also help us achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals set by the United Nations 2030 
Agenda.

a concerted effort and taking into account the 
contributions made by other government bodies, 
the private sector, civil society and academia so that 
these initiatives may come true. The Resilience 
Office, which is to be consolidated within the city 
government structure, will have specific powers, 
will work jointly with other government agencies 
and will be always open to community networking. 
The 100RC Program, pioneered by the 
Rockefeller Foundation, will have a key role in the 
implementation process, offering the support of 
other cities and partners in the network, and acting 
as a link between our city and possible sources of 
finance to materialize those initiatives regarded as a 
common priority. 
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the 
Resilient Santa Fe Program, the Resilience 
Committee and the Resilience Advisory Board 
have been officially established within the city 

government structure. The Resilience Strategy 
will be submitted to the Honorable City Council 
to count on its support for the inclusion of these 
initiatives in subsequent city budgets. The 
Resilience Office will be consolidated into the city 
government structure, with specific powers and 
a cross-sectional approach to work together with 
other government agencies and open to community 
networking.
Also, it is appropriate to profoundly thank the 
100RC team for their support and for giving the 
city a chance to envision, discover, design and build 
a more resilient Santa Fe. 
Finally, we want to invite the different people and 
institutions that participated in this process and the 
community at large to turn this Resilience Strategy 
into a dynamic, living document, in order to jointly 
achieve our targets and become a more inclusive, 
integrated, dynamic and thriving city.

the reSilienCe Strategy in
the City and gloBal agenda

At the heart of the “Agenda 2030 for Sustainable 
Development”, adopted by 193 UN member countries in 
September 2015, are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) and 169 targets, which represent a universal and 
integral commitment to eradicate poverty and achieve 
sustainable development worldwide. 
This global agenda is included in Santa Fe’s Resilience 
Strategy. The SDGs most frequently mentioned in 
its initiatives are N° 9 “Industry, Innovation and 
Infrastructure”, followed by N° 11 “Sustainable Cities and 
Communities”, especially: Ensuring access to safe and 
affordable housing and basic services and upgrading slum 
settlements. Other frequent goals include N° 10 “Reduced 
Inequalities” and N° 8 “Decent Work and Economic Growth”. 
This is by no means a coincidence, since these goals are 
closely related to the challenges, stresses and shocks 
identified in the Preliminary Resilience Assessment and 
grouped into four emerging themes. 

Furthermore, the initiatives set forth in the 2020 
Development Plan for the city of Santa Fe clearly show the 
three goals most frequently mentioned in the Strategy, 
namely: “Opportunities for All”, “Efficient, Modern and 
Participatory Government” and “Works and Services in 
Every Neighborhood”. (See table on next page).

RESILIENT

The Resilience Strategy is the outcome of a 
collaborative process developed by the city of Santa Fe 
(Argentina) in 2015 with the support of the 100 
Resilient Cities Program, pioneered by the Rockefeller 
Foundation, to foster urban resilience worldwide.
This document is structured into five sections: The 
Introduction includes the Urban Resilience 
Framework. The “Context and Challenges faced by 
Santa Fe” section describes the city strengths, 
weaknesses and emerging challenges through the lens 
of resilience. The “Resilience Strategy” section 
comprises the city vision, 4 pillars, 13 objectives and a 
description of 50 initiatives to achieve the set targets. 
This document is a call to action, a dynamic statement 
of goals and projects that shows the pledge made by 
Santafesinians to build a more resilient city.
