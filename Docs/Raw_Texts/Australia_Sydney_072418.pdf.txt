Acknowledgement of Country

Resilient Sydney acknowledges 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples as the First People and 
traditional custodians of the land and 
waters of this place we now call Sydney.
Aboriginal peoples continue to show 
great resilience and generosity of spirit 
towards other peoples with whom 
they now share their land and waters. 
Resilient Sydney recognises that by 
acknowledging our shared past, we are 
paving the way for a future where all 
Australians are embraced. 
To be resilient Sydney needs a future 
based on mutual respect and shared 
responsibility, where everyone and all 
living things can thrive.

Introduction

Lord Mayor's message

Resilient Sydney: a strategy for city resilience is 
the result of two years’ hard work involving all 
levels of government, business, academia and 
our communities - an unprecedented level of 
collaboration across metropolitan Sydney.
The process highlighted our best qualities as 
Sydneysiders – generosity, inventiveness, a 
willingness to pull together, and a commitment to 
improving the lives of all our diverse communities.
It is these very qualities that we will need the most 
as we face the challenges of the future. 
A rapid increase in density has put pressure 
on schools and early education and on open 
space, essential services and other infrastructure. 
Affordable housing is a critical issue and congestion 
is getting worse.
We’re seeing rising inequality, more homelessness, 
mental illness and obesity. And we’re experiencing 
increasingly extreme weather events with every year 
classed as another record breaking year in terms  
of rising temperatures. 
All these issues are challenges in themselves  
and they aren’t unique to Sydney - the effects  
of urbanisation, globalisation and climate change 
are seen right around the world.  They aren’t 
constrained by boundaries or different levels  
of governance. 
It’s why this strategy, developed with input from 
across Sydney, is such a breakthrough.
Resilient Sydney recognises no one organisation 
can solve our problems and instead looks at how 
we can work together, across boundaries to  
protect and champion the needs and interests  
of our communities.
Every organisation, and every individual, has a 
role to play. Our City is proud to be one of the 33 
councils of metropolitan Sydney working together 
with action, investment and policies and sharing 
what we are learning with cities across the world.
Working together can only make us, and our 
communities, stronger and more resilient,  
whatever disruptions we may face.

This strategy, 
developed with 
input from across 
Sydney, is such  
a breakthrough.

Introduction

Letter from 100 Resilient Cities

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team I want to congratulate the 
Resilient Sydney team and Chief Resilience Officer Beck Dawson on the 
release of Sydney’s Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for the city and our 
partnership. This document lays out an extraordinary vision of urban resilience 
that can serve as a model for all of us. 
While all resilience strategies are created with an understanding that silos 
must be breached and sectors and conventional borders planned across, this 
strategy has conceived of this urban ecosystem at a metropolitan scale, with a 
commitment by stakeholders to “work beyond our boundaries.” 
Governance matters in every city, and Sydney is no exception. Three layers 
of government, 33 metropolitan councils and separate investment strategies 
and policy making makes change difficult. Sydney’s resilience depends on 
collective leadership.
It is a true testament to the vision and effort of the Resilient Sydney Steering 
Committee and team that this metro-wide strategy has been forged in lieu of 
an existing governance structure that could give rise to it. As many cities now 
realise, they must plan across their metropolitan regions, together. Sydney 
is truly a leader, setting an important precedent that will be looked at for 
inspiration in our network and beyond. 
At every level of the city: as an individual, a neighbourhood, a business or a 
government, we invite you to use this work to connect and collaborate. 
We are excited to continue this next stage of our partnership in the 
implementation of this ground-breaking strategy, which will help build a 
resilient future for Sydney and propel the resilience effort worldwide.

Introduction

Letter from the Steering Committee

Our capacity to plan to reduce the 
impacts of disruption, and to realise 
opportunities in recovery is a measure 
of our resilience. The scale of disasters 
and disruptions affecting major cities 
elsewhere regularly overwhelms their 
capacity to respond. The only way 
to understand and address these 
challenges at a metropolitan scale in 
Sydney is by making a clear decision to 
work beyond our boundaries. 

Our metropolis is governed by many 
organisations. More than 100 business 
and government entities, agencies and 
departments have some level of policy 
or operational control. This makes 
building resilience a challenge every 
major organisation must address.
From inception in 2015, we’ve listened 
to our communities and representatives 
from government, business and 
academia. We’ve taken an honest look 
at our city and discussed new ways of 

solving things together. We will  
continue to harness this dynamic 
energy as we manage growth and the 
challenges it brings.
Resilience is an approach all 
organisations must adopt to improve 
the safety and quality of life of 
everyone in metropolitan Sydney. Our 
organisations are already making a 
commitment to do so.
We invite you to join us.

Introduction

Executive Summary

Resilient Sydney, is the first resilience strategy 
for metropolitan Sydney.
This strategy sets the direction we must take to strengthen 
our ability to survive, adapt and thrive in the face of 
increasing global uncertainty and local shocks and 
stresses. This strategy calls for business, government, 
academia, communities and individuals to lead and work 
as one city.
This strategy marks a new spirit of collaboration and 
connection in our city and is the result of two years of effort 
across Sydney. It responds to the results of engagement 
with over 1,000 people and over one hundred 
organisations. The document sets out a five-year strategy 
on the path to build our resilience. This approach has 
been developed with all of Sydney’s metropolitan councils 
and contributors from the NSW Government, business and 
community organisations. 

This strategy sets the 
direction we must take  
to strengthen our ability to 
survive, adapt and thrive 
in the face of increasing 
global uncertainty and local 
shocks and stresses.

Sydney is a beautiful, prosperous and multicultural city, but 
it is struggling to maintain its liveability and equity during 
a time of rapid growth. As our city grows it is experiencing 
a range of chronic stresses such as a lack of housing 
affordability, transport congestion and chronic illness that 
are impacting people’s everyday lives. The city regularly 
responds to a range of shock events such as extreme 
heat, storms and flooding or bushfires and cyber attacks. 
Sydney has the opportunity to use its growth to address 
vulnerabilities to our economy and environment and create 
a place of opportunity and wellbeing for everyone.
Sydney will be a thriving and prosperous city of connected 
and cohesive communities with resilience at its heart. 
Connections and collaborations will be strong within and 
between governments, businesses and communities.

Introduction

It is time for 
Sydney to act 
as one city. 
To become 
connected, 
inclusive and 
resilient is 
a challenge 
every major 
organisation 
in Sydney 
must address, 
together. 

Our vision for Sydney is a metropolis that is 
connected, inclusive and resilient. We are  
one city.
The directions in this strategy reflect the priorities people 
want for Sydney’s future – providing a greater say in 
decisions that affect them, better collaboration in leadership, 
stronger community connections and transport connections, 
more focus on protecting our environment, better emergency 
preparedness, and acknowledgement and respect for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as one of the 
world’s most resilient cultures. 

This strategy supports organisations and communities to 
participate and collaborate in building connections and 
developing their resilience plans. You are invited to make 
your own Sydney resilience commitment and take part in the 
actions in this plan. We will monitor and report on progress to 
encourage further action and show change. 
It is time for Sydney to act as one city. To become connected, 
inclusive and resilient is a challenge every organisation and 
resident in Sydney must address, together.

Resilient Sydney:  
A strategy for city resilience 
is a call to action for 
collaboration and working 
beyond our boundaries

Introduction

Resilient Sydneysiders
We invite all residents of Sydney to actively participate in this 
strategy by taking simple actions to build Sydney’s resilience. 
Everyone can understand and reduce their exposure to the 
risks arising from the shocks and stresses of Sydney. You will 
contribute to building Sydney’s resilience when you: 

 o establish a quick and easy network of support with 3 key 

contacts and neighbours

 o review the risks relevant to where you live or work
 o use checklists of actions to make an emergency plan
 o save the emergency plan as a PDF to be printed and 

shared with others

 o volunteer to support your community, though joining a 

local group or undertaking first aid training and

 o use tools to support these actions such as the Get 

Prepared app and the NSW Government Get Ready NSW 
and local council websites.

Our invitation

City resilience commitment 
We invite all government, business, academic and community 
sector organisations in metropolitan Sydney to pledge to 
build their capacity to understand and manage vulnerabilities, 
interdependencies and risks for everyone in metropolitan 
Sydney. 
By taking this commitment you will ensure continuity 
and safety for local communities as well as customers 
and employees during disruptions. You will demonstrate 
innovation and leadership, and improve the wellbeing and 
prosperity of our community. You will reduce potential revenue 
and continuity impacts to your organisation arising from the 
key shocks and stresses of Sydney.
Resilient Sydney invites you to lead these changes by taking 
our ‘city resilience commitment’. By adopting these directions 
your organisation will manage risks and potential impacts 
arising from the key shocks and stresses of Sydney. 
You will also contribute to building Sydney’s resilience when 
your organisation acts to:

 o investigate and understand how the shocks and stresses 

create metropolitan scale community risks and local 
place-based risks for your organisation

 o engage with the people in the city who are most impacted 

by your decisions

 o clarify your role in building Sydney’s resilience
 o engage in training and capacity building across your 

organisation

 o develop an action plan for your organisation and adopt 

the directions for resilience

 o undertake action and investment.

Our Resilience

What is city resilience? 

City resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, businesses and systems within a  
city to survive, adapt and thrive no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks  
they experience. 

Why resilience matters
Disasters and disruptions can be expensive and impactful 
– whether they are caused by short term shocks or chronic 
stresses in cities. People can lose their lives. Livelihoods and 
mental health can be affected. Governments, businesses and 
the community are required to fund losses and recovery costs 
when infrastructure fails, markets change or the environment 
is damaged.
Taking action to proactively manage city challenges and 
interdependencies offers access to multiple benefits, or a 
‘resilience dividend’. When disruptions are expected, planned 
for and turned into opportunities, they offer financial, social 
and environmental benefits. These opportunities can be 
understood through the City Resilience Framework and 
achieved through:

 o preventing or mitigating stresses and shocks
 o adapting to unexpected shocks and stresses 
 o rapidly returning to normal and revitalising after 

disruptions

 o accessing benefits when there are no disruptions
 o productive, peaceful prosperity and improved equity in 

times of stability.

Chronic stresses weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-
day or cyclical basis. Examples include: homelessness and 
housing affordability, lack of access to public transportation 
systems, family violence, climate change, structural inequity, 
and chronic food or water shortages.
Acute shocks are sudden, short-term events that threaten 
a city. Examples include: major storms, floods, bushfires, 
heatwaves, disease outbreaks, terrorism and cyber-attacks.

Resilience in global cities

Mexico City, Mexico
Mobility hierarchy for 
transport and urban planning 
decision making
Mexico has made significant 
investment in mobility and 
acknowledgement  of mobility 
as a fundamental right. Bus 
rapid transit and policy favouring 
pedestrians and bikes has 
created a more robust and 
equitable transportation system.

Norfolk, Virginia, USA
Long Horizon Planning
Norfolk undertook long horizon 
land use planning efforts that 
considered both at-risk and 
secure areas of the city in a 
holistic planning effort and 
included increasing density in 
protected or high ground areas 
as a resilience strategy.

Medellin, Columbia
Resilience Think Tank
The Medellin Office of Resilience 
created a separate Think Tank 
for engaging a wider audience 
in evaluating and innovating 
on resilience initiatives and 
quantitatively assessing 
effectiveness of programs and 
projects government and the 
private sector implement.

San Juan, Puerto Rico
Renewable Energy
San Juan aims to create 
redundancies in the energy 
supply and reduced 
dependence on imported liquid 
fuel through development of 
solar farms and residential 
incentive programs for smaller 
scale installations. 

Los Angeles, California, USA
Housing affordability
City initiatives will double the 
pace of affordable housing 
production and preservation, 
and triple production of new 
permanent supportive housing 
by changing regulations, 
adopting new financing 
mechanisms, and exploring 
adaptive re-use of publicly-
owned sites.

Thessaloniki, Greece
Community engagement
Youth empowerment was 
achieved through outreach  
and the convening of a Youth 
Council for city government 
to foster the country’s next 
generation of leaders.

Bangkok, Thailand
Economic Empowerment
Bangkok is supporting small 
scale urban agriculture for 
food production value and 
economic empowerment of 
urban communities as well as 
maintaining land for open space 
and water storage in extreme 
rain events.

Rotterdam, Netherlands
Threat of Cyber attack
Rotterdam created a Cyber 
Resilience Platform for education 
and knowledge sharing to 
promote investment in cyber 
security.
Funding and adopting  
climate adaption initiatives
Rotterdam promoted small 
scale, citizen-led climate 
adaptation projects to 
support community learning, 
placemaking, and to  
increase the reach of the 
planning process.

Melbourne
Urban Heat Island, need 
for cooling spaces for the 
community
The Urban Forest program 
seeks to enable strong natural 
assets and ecosystems as well 
as to create environments for 
social cohesion and cooling
Metro Cycle Plan
The metropolitan cycling  
network initiative proposes 
connection of key hubs in 
the city to increase bicycle 
participation and set an  
example for local councils to 
invest in bike infrastructure  
as well.

As a member of the 
100 Resilient Cities 
Network, Sydney is 
exchanging ideas 
with cities worldwide 
about the most 
effective ways to 
build resilience. The 
cities listed have a 
resilience strategy 
and are taking  
actions relevant to  
the challenges we 
face in Sydney.

New York City,  
New York, USA
Heat wave programs
New York created an initiative 
to mitigate urban heat island 
across the city and petitioned 
successfully for the expansion 
of a federal program for 
low income residents to be 
applicable for air conditioning 
purchase, installation, and 
energy costs.
Digital accessibility
New York is supporting access 
to affordable broadband for 
business and offering free Wi-Fi 
through the LinkNYC program in 
the city’s public spaces.

Boston, Massachusetts, USA
Inequity
Resilience planned through the 
lens of racial equity and social 
justice, including access to 
employment and community 
education.

Our Resilience

Singapore
Heat Advisory
Singapore created a 
comprehensive heat index and 
public advisory system to keep 
people safe and healthy in a 
heat wave.

Wellington, New Zealand
Citizen Disaster 
Preparedness and Education
A series of online maps and blue 
lines physically drawn on roads 
in Wellington indicate evacuation 
and safe zones for tsunamis 
after earthquakes. This strategy 
provides both digital and 
analogue information for citizens 
and to integrate emergency 
preparedness into everyday life.

Christchurch, New Zealand
Engagement of Indigenous 
Peoples
The Treaty Partnership began 
in 1940 as a pact between 
the Maori people and the 
Crown. Today, it fosters a truly 
collaborative, bi-cultural model 
of governance regarding 
resilience and day to day 
governance.

Durban, South Africa
Adaptation in Resource 
Scarce Environment
Durban is tackling its climate 
adaptation efforts with limited 
resources, adapting existing 
systems and integrating 
information and decision-
making centres to do more 
with less. Partnership with 
higher education institutions 
to supplement government 
research capacity has been 
particular effective.

Decision making for urban resilience in Sydney

The complexity and connectedness of 
modern, dynamic cities and city systems 
makes applying resilience thinking to 
urban governance a challenge. 

Resilient Sydney consulted with 100 Resilient Cities as well 
as Australian and global academics researching resilience 
in: ecosystems and climate, emergency management 
and counter terrorism, infrastructure planning and property 
management, insurance and finance, communities and 
personal resilience, and economies and the governance 
of cities.
This has shaped our understanding of resilience 
theory, informed our consultation process and is 
reflected in our resilience framework for Sydney. 
Technical processes used include: the City Resilience 
Framework, the key shocks and stresses of Sydney, the 
resilience lens and resilience behaviours. Community 
and stakeholder research processes used include: 
resident surveys, semi structured interviews, in depth 
workshops exploring disaster scenarios, collaborative 
design of opportunities for potential projects and 
deliberative democracy for decision making. 
The methodology we used is detailed in the Diagnostic 
Report (2017), and the Engagement Report (2017), 
and is summarised below. The summary shows 
how resilience theory has influenced the strategy 
development process and outputs.

Resilience theory

The City Resilience Framework
100 Resilient Cities uses the City Resilience Framework, 
developed by Arup and the Rockefeller Foundation, to  
assess the strengths and weaknesses of cities within four 
‘dimensions’ and 12 ‘drivers’. 
We have adopted this framework for metropolitan Sydney.

The four dimensions are:
 o health and wellbeing: the essential city services  

that safeguard human health and diverse and  
secure livelihoods

 o economy and society: the social and financial  

systems that enable urban populations to live peacefully, 
and act collectively

 o infrastructure and environment: the way in which  
built and natural assets provide critical services and 
protect residents

 o leadership and strategy: effective leadership  

and management, empowered stakeholders and 
integrated planning.

Resilience Behaviours  

The resilience lens – 7 guiding 
principles
The resilience lens provides guiding principles at 
each phase to direct effective research, consultation, 
planning and action.  
The lens helped us to: 

 o Approach the challenge in an integrated  
and holistic way that crosses silos, using  
the City Resilience Framework 

 o Consider impacts of multiple shocks and  

stresses identified through a broad risk and  
hazard assessment 

 o Aim for short, medium and long-term benefits 
 o Consider resilience behaviours and qualities  

when proposing solutions

 o Strive for equitable outcomes
 o Leverage actions across a broad group  

of stakeholders

 o Consider cross-jurisdictional implications at 

intercity, regional, national, global levels.

People, organisations, businesses, 
communities and cities that survive 
disasters all show resilient behaviours 
and decision making. Sydney can 
learn from these experiences. We 
have adapted the five key resilience 
behaviours identified in the work of  
100 Resilient Cities and Professor Judith 
Rodin in The Resilience Dividend (2014). 
This approach has informed how we 
consider decision making in Sydney,  
in particular. 

We asked all consultation participants to consider the below questions  
for resilience.
Integrated 
Are we engaging widely to support decision making and connecting people, 
communities and organisations?
Aware 
Do we understand how critical city systems work and how they rely on each other?
Adaptive 
Are we flexible to respond to rapid changes and disruptions to maintain health  
and liveability?
Diverse 
Do we value the role of different people, places and technologies in a cohesive and 
just city economy and society?
Self-regulation 
Are we creating stable and flexible governance structures?

Asking Sydney about resilience

Since 2015, Resilient Sydney worked with more than  
1,000 representatives from all levels of government, business, 
academia, community services, First Nations Peoples and 
our local communities. This group developed around 300 
solutions, 70 per cent of which successfully addressed more 
than one aspect of the City Resilience Framework. 
We used the core values and research principles set  
by the International Association for Public Participation  
(IAP2), in a comprehensive engagement process to build  
our understanding of Sydney’s challenges, connections  
and capacity to integrate resilience into decision making.  
We recruited a robust, diverse sample of participants, 
provided consistent information and asked a uniform set  
of questions to enable participants to identify problems  
and develop solutions. 

The outcome was a set 
of responses across a 
spectrum of political views, 
expertise, background, 
geography, experience  
and understanding of  
our metropolitan city. 

Of all these responses, the community provided the clearest 
insight into the city as a system. The daily difficulties 
experienced by residents in many parts of Sydney highlighted 
the connections between housing, transport, jobs, education, 
health services and vulnerability to shock events such as 
extreme heat.
Who we consulted

 o Elders - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elders from 

across metropolitan Sydney

 o Community – groups of residents from the metropolitan 

planning districts of Sydney, with each group reflecting 
the demographic, socioeconomic and cultural profile of 
its district

 o Government and business representatives – 

representatives from business, community sectors,  
local and state governments

 o Working groups – experts from all sectors, including 
academia, and city leaders with influence and decision 
making authority.

Shocks and stresses

Urbanisation, globalisation and climate change 
mean Sydney’s key systems such as health 
services, transport, utilities, telecommunications 
and social services are increasingly 
interdependent with other parts of the country, 
region and globe and therefore potentially more 
vulnerable to disruption. 
Disruption may be due to a sudden, abrupt shock event 
that stops everything in our city, or a slow burning stress that 
makes life more difficult day to day. Chronic stresses can 
increase the likelihood of shock events, amplify the impacts, 
and increase recovery time and cost.  
Resilience provides a view of how underlying vulnerabilities 
and stresses cause much bigger impacts during shock 
events. City systems are interdependent and work together. 
Cascading failures can occur when these interdependencies 
are not understood or managed. 
Identifying the key shocks and stresses, as well as taking 
a systems view of how Sydney supports residents, 
communities, government and businesses helps us best 
manage community needs, risks and vulnerabilities. 
We used the 100 Resilient Cities tools to identify the most 
impactful shocks and stresses facing metropolitan Sydney. 
The 2016 Preliminary Resilience Assessment and City  
Context Report detail these shocks, stresses, vulnerable 
assets and megatrends2.
2 Preliminary Resilience Assessment (2016), and City Context Report (2016). Resilient Sydney.

Shocks
Sydney is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, 
particularly heatwaves and storms and their impacts  
including bushfires and flooding. When energy demand 
increases during a heat wave, electrical infrastructure is 
more likely to overload and fail, causing air conditioners to 
stop working  and outages to communication networks, 
reducing the ability of people to seek help. This shows how 
easily extreme weather events can trigger other shocks, such 
as power and communications outages, water network or 
infrastructure failures.
A financial crisis could degrade the ability of Sydney’s 
economy to function due to our large finance, media and 
telecommunications sectors, and the high levels of household 
debt across Sydney. Sydney has demonstrated resilience to 
global financial crises such as the 2007 global financial crisis, 
but there is the potential for another event to occur.

Stresses
Many of Sydney’s most impactful stresses are associated 
with planning and investment to support the rapid growth and 
social changes of our population. The city is experiencing 
a loss of housing affordability and high rates of household 
debt. There is a lack of transport diversity and employment 
diversity, particularly in Western Sydney. These contribute to 
increasing geographic and social inequity and the financial 
vulnerability of communities to shock events. Communities 
are concerned about the decreasing social cohesion in our 
diverse population.
Chronic stresses can amplify the impacts of shock events. 
Rising temperatures make it difficult to exercise outdoors, 
exacerbating our already high rates of chronic illness and 
increasing pressure on our health services. These issues 
combine to affect how our health services are able to perform 
during a disaster.
Sydney has begun to collaborate for cooperative planning 
between land use and transport services to address 
some stresses, yet a more holistic systems approach to 
understanding interdependencies is required to reduce the 
impact of stresses on people’s lives.

A History of Shocks

The most common disruptions to Sydney 
involve traffic crashes and weather events. 
We have also experienced serious shock 
events where our community has been more 
vulnerable due to underlying stresses. Extreme 
weather can cause disasters if infrastructure 
fails, or people are poorly prepared. Global 
cyber-attacks and financial crises affect Sydney 
when local safeguards are not sufficient or 
business is poorly prepared. 

Below are some of the shock events that 
have affected Sydney over the last 30 years.

Sydney's resilience challenges and opportunities

The consultation process highlighted the 
following key priorities for metropolitan 
Sydney and provided the framework and 
direction for the Resilient Sydney strategy:
Community agency
From a community perspective, consultation on city changes 
are led by many separate government and private sector 
organisations operating at different scales and lacking 
coordination. There is an appetite for communities to act 
in collaboration and partnership with governments and 
businesses. Communities are willing to create solutions 
based on their needs and local knowledge of places and 
district communities. Solutions include encouraging best 
practice in inclusive engagement to ensure decision-making 
puts people first and the most impacted are the most 
included in decisions.
Adaptation to climate
There was strong and widespread concern about inaction 
in reducing carbon emissions and adapting to our changing 
climate. Solutions include: decentralised renewable energy for 
carbon emission reduction and energy security, changes to 
building codes and regulations, and city greening to promote 
healthy lifestyles and enhance comfort during extreme heat.
Social cohesion
Improving social cohesion, including increasing tolerance for 
cultural diversity, is fundamental to Sydney’s ability to survive 
and thrive. Solutions include prioritising learning from First 
Nations Peoples, investing in community events, increasing 
awareness of and strengthening our responses to racism, 
and ensuring decision-making and leadership better reflects 
our diverse cultures.
Community preparedness
There is no broad understanding of our community 
preparedness for shocks across Sydney. Solutions include: 
improving connections between organisations that manage 
city systems, providing multiple methods of delivering 
essential services to communities, data sharing, and 
communication and collaboration to plan for disruption in 
organisations and communities.
Governance collaboration
Fragmented governance and distrust is one of Sydney’s 
biggest challenges and collaboration is a priority. Community 
concerns related to how separate decisions are made that 
determine housing, infrastructure and services, transportation, 
education and employment. These issues are connected in 
people’s lives. Suggested changes include connecting the 
many private and public sector organisations responsible  
for city plans to create new and improved collaborative 
decision making.

2 Preliminary Resilience Assessment (2016), and City Context Report (2016). Resilient Sydney.

Collectively these outputs from the consultation and technical 
assessments of the city resulted in a set of five clear resilience 
challenges for Sydney to tackle:

 o inequitable growth
 o pressure on our health, environment and economy
 o declining social cohesion
 o lack of understanding of risks
 o disjointed governance.

Our responses to these five challenges are outlined in the 
Strategy as five directions and 35 actions.

Our city and people

Metropolitan Sydney today

Sydney is one of the most diverse cities  
in the world. The metropolis is home to the 
largest population of Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples in Australia. Around  
5 million people from more than 200 different 
cultures also live here. Sydney is known for 
the beauty of its natural environment, outdoor 
lifestyle and liveability. 
Sydney is a key driver of the Australian economy 
contributing almost 40% of GDP. It is home to 
strong financial, tertiary education, media and 
telecommunications sectors and a growing digital 
industry. The central business districts of Sydney and 
Parramatta are to the east of the geographic centre.  
They are the knowledge and financial hubs of our city. 
Our city already covers over 12,000 square kilometres 
and is growing, particularly in the west and southwest, 
where a large portion of Sydney’s young people live. 
The suburbs of the north and east are home to an older, 
ageing demographic. 
Sydney sits in a broad sandstone bowl at the foot of 
the Blue Mountains. Ancient rivers and waterways 
have carved the hills, alluvial plains and deep harbour, 
eventually depositing golden sands on Sydney’s 
beaches. Our city’s waterways and topography constrain 
the development of infrastructure and spatially divide 
communities. There is a distinct economic, health and 
opportunity divide between communities in the southwest 
and northeast of Sydney.
Regional NSW and the semi-rural fringe of Sydney supply 
most of our city’s food. Water, energy and much of our 
workforce also come from Sydney’s growing edges.
Sydney’s climate is changing. Our natural and urban 
environments are increasingly affected by warming 
temperatures, heatwaves, intense storms and bushfires.

Governance and global commitments

Local governance and policy context
Global issues need global solutions and integration. 100 
Resilient Cities is part of a worldwide trend in programs that 
engage decision makers who represent big populations in 
nations and in cities. Through the United Nations (UN), the 
Australian Government has made commitments to global 
initiatives for collaborative action.  
Cities are at the forefront of global collaboration for global 
issues and making use of global networks such as 100 
Resilient Cities to learn from each other and make change. 
Cities are adopting or aligning to the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals and managing disaster risk reduction 
through local emergency and disaster preparedness. 
Coalitions such as the C40 alliance and Carbon Neutral Cities 
Alliance are sharing best practice and experience on climate 
change and adaptation. 
In New South Wales and Sydney, the links between the 
global, national, and local or city-scale approaches usually 
take place through state government policies, budgets and 
investments and local government strategies and plans.

Government in Sydney
There are three layers of government in Sydney: the Australian 
Commonwealth Government, New South Wales State 
Government, and many local governments. This multi layered 
and complex governance system requires collaboration 
for  effective strategic planning and implementation at 
metropolitan scale.
Within these layers the Australian Commonwealth 
Government is responsible for: defence and foreign affairs; 
trade, commerce and currency; immigration; postal services; 
telecommunications and broadcasting; air travel and most 
social services and pensions. The Australian Commonwealth 
Government also provides funding to the NSW State 
Government for health, welfare, education, and infrastructure.
From a resilience policy position the Australian 
Commonwealth Government has developed a National 
Strategy for Disaster Resilience (2011) which sets seven 
priority areas to build disaster resilience communities and a 
Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy (2015) which aims to 
ensure the continued operation of infrastructure in the face of 
all hazards.

44    |    Resilient Sydney

Our city and peoplePolicy in Sydney
At a NSW State Government level, major responsibilities 
include: schools and hospitals; conservation and 
environment; roads, railways and public transport; public 
works; agriculture and fishing; industrial relations; community 
services; sport and recreation; consumer affairs and 
police, prisons and emergency services. Fire and Rescue 
NSW, NSW Rural Fire Service, and NSW State Emergency 
Service are funded through the Australian Commonwealth 
Government Emergency Services Levy on household 
insurance policies (73.7%), Local Government (11.7%), with 
the NSW Government contributing (14.6%). 
NSW has a framework of plans, guidelines and committees 
for emergency Planning, Preparation, Response, and 
Recovery (PPRR) activities at state, district, and local levels. 
They prescribe the role, responsibilities and arrangements 
for each agency involved in emergency management. 
Metropolitan Sydney is divided into three Emergency 
Management Regions, designated as Sydney Metro, North 
West Metro, and Southwest Metro. Across these three regions 
there are a number of emergency management sub plans 
which support the NSW State Emergency Management 
Plan (2012). Support for community resilience post-disaster 
includes the NSW Department of Emergency Community 
Resilience Innovation Plan (2016).

The NSW State Government defines the jurisdictions and 
geographical boundaries of each local government area. 
Key responsibilities assigned to the 33 local government 
areas across metropolitan Sydney include: building 
development and regulations; public health; local roads and 
footpaths; public recreation facilities such as aquatic centres, 
playgrounds and youth centres, libraries, parks and playing 
fields; local environmental issues, waste disposal, childcare 
facilities and many other community services.
In managing these services, Community Strategic Plans 
are developed which represent the highest level of 
strategic planning undertaken by each local council. It is 
in these Community Strategic Plans that local councils 
across metropolitan Sydney including the City of Sydney, 
Parramatta, Penrith and Campbelltown are starting to adopt 
a resilience approach for their communities. The Greater 
Sydney Commission, the agency responsible for planning 
for Greater Sydney, identified resilience as a key direction 
in the Greater Sydney Region Plan (2018). The 2018 NSW 
State infrastructure Stategy includes six recommendations 
regarding resilience. This will assist with putting into operation 
resilience within land use planning and operational programs 
across local government.
Future monitoring and evaluation of resilience in Sydney 
will report on how community, government, academia and 
businesses are building their capacity for resilience.

Learning from Elders: resilience and resistance

48    |    Resilient Sydney

Our city and people

“ Aboriginal people have always lived in 
Sydney. After the arrival of the First Fleet 
in 1788, the British encountered Aboriginal 
people around the coves and bays of Port 
Jackson. The Aboriginal communities here 
showed enormous resilience and generosity 
towards the British who took their land.” 

Barani Barrabagu1

Australia’s First Nations Peoples are the world’s oldest 
continuous living culture and the traditional custodians  
of Sydney. 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community Elders and 
leaders shared their knowledge on the qualities that enabled 
their communities to thrive for tens of thousands of years.
Elders identified the following qualities as critical  
for resilience:
Connection A sense of belonging and connection to family, 
community and culture, with Elders as givers and receivers of 
culture, respect and care
Sharing A willingness to help anyone who needs it, even if 
you don’t have much yourself
Participating A strong work ethic – just getting on with it
Identity Visibility of culture and support for young people – 
from the Indigenous and wider community.

The Elders identified a single key shock, the European 
colonisation of the Sydney Basin, as the single most impactful 
event on their ancestors, their lives and the region. They 
agreed that physical and cultural survival in the face of 
colonisation is a binding theme for First Nations individuals 
and groups in Sydney. 
The skills, characteristics and behaviours that enabled  
First Nations People to survive this event continue to be 
employed by Sydney’s First Nation Peoples to cope with 
ongoing stresses.

Learning from Elders: resilience and resistance

An impactful shock
The impacts of European colonisation of the  
Sydney Basin including:

 o dispossession from people, country, families, 

culture, kinship systems

 o massacres and conflict, resistance.
Ongoing stresses
Daily, ongoing stresses described by  
participants include

 o  racism
 o child removal
 o access to traditional lands
 o educational issues
 o over-representation in the legal system
 o over policing
 o access to resources
 o inadequate and unaffordable housing.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are proud 
of the gains made by themselves, their families and 
communities in managing their response to this shock 
and these stresses. They identified resilience as a direct 
result of the fight to survive. 

“ Resilience comes from  
our identity, a sense of 
belonging and community.”

A multicultural city

Sydney’s communities today are home to people from across 
the world. Sara Mansour shares how multiculturalism in her 
community in Punchbowl shaped her experience and feeling 
of home in Sydney.

“ Home means a lot of  
things to different 
people but is ultimately 
underpinned by the  
notion of being in a place 
that is familiar and safe.”

Our city and people

My Australia is barbeques, or as my dad still  
says BURBEQUE  
As the meat sizzles on the fire, tabouli and tomato 
sauce and homemade pavlova cake served alongside 
some knafeh 
The perfect cultural dichotomy  
And its not hard to see no matter our creed we always 
rep our team 
Hashtag Wanderers FC 
This country will never be tainted by café sieges, we 
will always ride together from the mountains where the 
bushfires rage, we stand together down to the shore 
where the lifesavers age 
Under that great southern sun  
My Australia is one  
Where women wear their saris and their colourful hijabs 
proudly 
Men don sweat stained blue collars like war badges 
You can get the best pho in Sydney 
12 dollar woodfired pizzas, the realest Lebanese  
and Chinese 
And you feel at ease because no one judges your 
garlic breath or the  
tabouli stuck in your teeth 
It is finding the most authentic spices 
In shops where signs in foreign languages sit like 
jewelled crowns atop their doors 
It is neighbours passing barbequed meat over the fence 
And always saying hello 
It is all the stoic traditions 
It is stoic- a community that has been hardened by 
media headlines 
It is targeted 
It is judged 
It is 3am sirens and perceived thugs
But it is also where the calls to prayer 
Gently interludes with the ringing of church bells 
It is co-existance   
And artistic resistance  
Like the 4elements youth hiphop festival 
And the largest poetry slam in the country
It is my Dad's voice 25 years on 
Accent thick with resilience 
Warm like an Autumn breeze 
Smelling of petrol and truck smoke and all the forgotten 
things 
All the zaatar and the tahini and the crushed petals that 
were once dreams 
Saying  
We are lucky 
It's not perfect.  
But it's home.   
It will never be perfect, but it will always be home 
My Australia is home. When the rest of the world  
says no.

Poem of Resilience  
by Sara Mansour, Bankstown Poetry Slam

So when people ask me where I’m from 
I tell em Punchbowl 
More often than not, they smile, and reply 
“No, where are you FROM?” 
I sigh, roll my eyes and in an explanatory  
tone respond 
"PUNCHBOWL". 
You know.. It’s near Bankstown 
The city where  mouths do not ebb the flow of 
"Welcome" in over 60 different tongues 
Where over 100 nationalities are housed under  
one postcode 
This is my ode to the only place I know  
Where one is told to go back 
Because everyone understands 
This is my ode to home
My Australia is 
Walking in the streets of Punchbowl 
With the smell of freshly roasted Lebanese coffee 
kissing the Asian bakeries good morning 
The eucalyptus towers overhead and the 
frangipanis scent my breath 
As we sing the unofficial national anthem 
"I come from a land down unda..." 
Living from beat to beat 
Bumping down the streets 
With Tupac on our tongues and 
We're headed for the beach 
Water so unapologetically salty to the eyes 
But we take it in our stride 
Remembering all the lessons at Greenacre pools 
and at school 
When Cronulla hit high tide

Our strategyOur strategy

Our resilience 
challenges and 
opportunities are 
described as five 
directions for 
resilience in Sydney. 

DIRECTION

1

People centred city

We include communities in decision making  
for growth and equity, so people connected to 
where they live and able to access transport, 
affordable housing and education and 
employment opportunities.

DIRECTION

2

DIRECTION

3

Live with our climate

Connect to strength

We adapt to sustain our quality of life and our 
environment, so people have access to public 
and recreation space and natural environments 
throughout the city for climate comfort and safety, 
health and city connections.

Every Sydneysider will feel they belong in Sydney 
as part of the community with equal access to 
engage in society, the economy and all the city 
has to offer.

DIRECTION

4

Get ready

DIRECTION

5

One city

We know how to prevent, prepare, respond and 
recover, where Sydneysiders and organisations 
understand the risks they face and how to work 
together to respond to them, now and in the future.

We are one city, where governing organisations 
across Sydney pledge to build their capacity 
to understand and manage vulnerabilities, 
interdependencies and risks for everyone in a 
resilient metropolitan Sydney.

   |    59

Our strategyKey to the actions

The strategy has five directions in a five year 
action plan of 35 actions. The following outline 
explains the types of actions and roles and 
responsibilities of participants. 

Action status
Actions are activities that are being initiated, strengthened  
or amplified in Sydney.

 o initiate: action has began as a result of this strategy, bringing 

together new partners to solve Sydney’s challenges

 o strengthen: action is under development though requires 

more support, research or new partners to be a more 
effective intervention in our city

 o amplify: action is underway in an effective pilot or small scale 

and will now be shared for wider adoption across Sydney.

Flagship actions
One or more Flagship Actions will spearhead community 
change for each direction. These have been selected 
because individually or collectively they:

 o address our resilience challenges and opportunities 

by understanding risks, knowing our role in managing 
these risks, including those impacted in our decisions, 
collaborating with others and investing to take action; 

 o increase capacity for a resilience based approach where  

the action supports Sydney to:
 – prevent or mitigate stresses and shocks
 – adapt to unexpected shocks and stresses 
 – rapidly return to normal and revitalise after disruptions
 – access benefits when there are no disruptions
 – improve equity and prosperity in times of stability.

 o deliver tangible benefit to our city and its people.

Flagship Actions are either underway now, or have been 
identified as a priority for the first year of implementation of  
the Resilient Sydney strategy.

Supporting actions
Supporting actions are important, often structural activities 
that enable the longer term delivery of the resilience direction.
These are more likely to be facilitated by a third party rather 
than Resilient Sydney. 
The role of the Resilient Sydney Office in delivering 
flagship and supporting actions:
Flagship actions are also those in which Resilient Sydney will 
play an active and material role, including:

 o direct participation in the activity – staff from the Resilient 

Sydney Office will attend meetings, contribute strategic 
advice, undertake research and/or project specific tasks

60    |    Resilient Sydney

 o providing evidence and the resilience decision making 
framework to guide development of the action through:
 – problem definition - identifying shocks, stresses, 

interdependencies and vulnerabilities

 – engagement to co-design the action – ensuring a 

diversity of stakeholders and communities are engaged, 
and the most impacted are included 

 – clarifying the role of the collaborative action team and 

each participant in delivering the action/outcome

 o providing a framework and support to develop a collective 

impact; and 

 o monitoring and evaluating the action with participants.
The Resilient Sydney Office may also provide resources, 
including support for funding, staff or other support as agreed 
through the Resilient Sydney Steering Committee.

Aligned actions
Aligned actions have been chosen for their collective capacity 
to deliver change for resilience.
Engagement to develop the Resilient Sydney strategy 
highlighted activities currently being undertaken across our 
city, state and country that play a vital role in contributing to 
Sydney’s resilience. Aligned actions are included to promote 
these activities, helping to amplify their reach and scale.
Others are proposed activities to be developed in future 
iterations of Resilient Sydney, once the flagship and 
supporting actions are underway.
Descriptions of aligned actions are brief and include an 
outline of the activity, the challenge it will address, and where 
relevant the organisations or individuals currently involved. 
The role of the Resilient Sydney Office in delivering 
Aligned actions:
For aligned actions that are already underway the Resilient 
Sydney Office will:

 o provide active promotions through our networks via 

newsletters, social media, online platforms and media

 o provide connections and networking opportunities 

through our events and engagement activities

 o provide a framework and support to develop a collective 

impact; and 

 o monitor and evaluate the action with participants.
The Resilient Sydney Office may play a more active  
role in these actions in future.

Our strategyRoles and responsibilities
Facilitator
Facilitators are individuals or organisation who have 
agreed to facilitate an action over the first one to 
five years of implementation of the Resilient Sydney 
strategy. Facilitation involves.

 o strategic coordination of initial efforts. These include: 

 – building shared understanding of the challenges
 – identifying other stakeholders/collaborators to join a 

collaborative action team 

 – agreeing the process for working together; and 
 – identifying and progressing formal arrangements such 

as governance structures and funding arrangements.

 o strategic coordination of co-design for measures, 

monitoring and evaluation of the action.

 o This may be provided by facilitators, to be agreed with 
the Resilient Sydney Office. This may involve providing 
backbone administrative support, funding and resources, 
and monitoring, evaluation and reporting to the Resilient 
Sydney Office.

Collaborators
Collaborators are individuals or organisations who have 
agreed to participate in the design and/or implementation 
of an action. Collaborators will engage in one or more of the 
following activities:

 o working with facilitators and other collaborators in an 

action team to build a shared understanding of the 
challenges, identifying other stakeholders/collaborators, 
working to agree the process for working together and 
participating in formal arrangements such as governance 
structures and funding arrangements

 o practical tasks to deliver the actions; and
 o monitoring and evaluation activities. 

Collaborators may provide practical support such as funding 
and resources.

Resilience challenge: Inequitable growth

Our city is growing, inequity is rising, and infrastructure and services lag behind. 
Sydney’s population is rising rapidly. It is projected to grow from 5 million people in 2016 
to 6.4 million by 20361. Most of this growth will occur in the west and south west - 45% of 
Sydneysiders will live there 2031 – as well as some parts of the inner east. Infrastructure, 
transport, schools and health services have not kept up with population growth in these areas. 

Sydney is the most unequal major 
city in Australia2.  Lower income 
earners tend to live in Sydney’s 
western and south western growth 
areas. These areas are less 
well served by public transport 
infrastructure, essential social 
services and job opportunities. Most 
commutes from these places to 
surrounding areas are made by car.
Sydney is the second least affordable 
city in the world with the median 

house price 12.2 times the median 
household income. The average 
household is required to spend 
28% of their income on rent to 
access a rental dwelling, putting 
them very close to the 30% rental 
stress threshold3. These households 
are likely to be more vulnerable to 
the impacts of sudden economic 
disruptions.
Our economy continues to grow, 
but the benefits of prosperity are 

not shared by everyone.The short 
timeframes and lack of integrated 
and inclusive decision making 
contribute to growing inequalities and 
impactful stresses. Opportunities for 
change lie in longer term planning for 
more resilient infrastructure in growth 
areas, including the most impacted in 
decisions that affect them and better 
collaboration between governments 
and agencies.

Housing
 o Sydney is the second least affordable 
city in the world5. The median house 
price in Sydney is 12.2 times median 
household income6.

Income and jobs
 o 20% of all income goes to 1% of 

Sydney’s population in Sydney’s east8. 
Less than 6% of all income goes to 
earners in Blacktown, Campbelltown  
and Penrith9.

 o 37% of all employment is located in  

Sydney's CBD10.

 o Manufacturing (which is in decline) 

employs the most people in the west, 
followed by retail, health care and  
social assistance11.

Transport
 o Sydney has the highest rate of trips by 

private vehicles in Australia (up to 80%), 
especially in the west and southwest7.

Education
 o Western Sydney has lower high  
school completion rates than the  
rest of Sydney12.

 o 71.9% of people in northern Sydney and 

44.9% in south western Sydney have 
post-school qualifications.

 o Most of Sydney’s major universities are 

located in the east 

Health Services
 o Western Sydney has almost 10% fewer hospital beds per 100,000 residents than in other parts of 

Sydney, and fewer staff proportionally. Yet there is higher demand, and higher rates of admissions in 
western Sydney13.

64    |    Resilient Sydney

Direction 1   o   People centred cityPeople centred city objective

We include communities in decision making  
for growth and equity

This direction aligns to:

Our community highlighted the need for affordable access 
to infrastructure, services, transport and shelter for everyone 
in Sydney, regardless of geographic and economic position.  
They also asked for skills and employment opportunities that 
are accessible for everyone in metropolitan Sydney.
Our community asked us to take a people-centred view of  
our city, including them in the investment and planning 
decisions that shape their lives. 
This direction addresses the priorities of our metropolitan 
community to deliver benefits that will help people all  
over Sydney to thrive. The following principles will guide  
our actions:
Resilient growth
We will take opportunities to invest in growth, transport 
connections and employment options that improve the 
resilience to key stresses of metropolitan Sydney, bringing 
multiple benefits and reducing vulnerabilities for all residents. 
Inclusion
We will provide our diverse communities with a genuine say in 
the decisions that affect them, ensuring those most impacted 
are included. 
Equity
We will put people first by ensuring skills and services are 
accessible to communities across metropolitan Sydney.

Flagship action

ACTION 1

Shocks and stresses managed through planning for growth 
Initiate: Action to occur 2019 –2022

       

The community have asked for 
integrated decision making that 
addresses key community stresses, 
whilst ensuring infrastructure and 
services meet local needs. This will 
be especially important as we plan 
for Sydney’s growth. The Greater 
Sydney Region Plan (2018) now 
incorporates the direction “A resilient 
city – adapting to a changing world” 
with objectives that focus on how 
people and places adapt to future 
shocks and stresses.
This action will use tried and tested 
100 Resilient Cities tools, including 

the “Assets and Risks Tool” to 
clarify the top shocks and stresses 
affecting different areas of Sydney. 
The results will inform council 
planning processes to prioritise risk 
reduction and investment needs for 
communities experiencing growth. 
Future resilience metrics will be 
explored to incentivise and measure 
resilience when councils collaborate, 
such as in economic corridors and 
cross-boundary planning areas.
By acknowledging the shocks and 
stresses and considering the five 
directions of this strategy, councils 

are adopting a resilience approach 
into their community strategic 
planning processes and operational 
plans. Engaging communities across 
Sydney in these issues will support 
integrated planning for resilience in 
economic development, education 
and employment opportunities, 
integrated transport, infrastructure, 
services and adaptive technology.
This work has already begun in 
Penrith City Council, Campbelltown 
Council and the City of Sydney. 

  Resilience value

This action will build capacity within and between local governments and communities for more adaptive, integrated decision 
making and will improve our understanding of systemic risk.  Criteria for investment will focus on more equitable outcomes 
from growth and more flexible governance and decision making that addresses long term community stresses.

ACTION 2

 

Network metropolitan practitioners for community agency
Initiate: Practitioners network began May 2017

The community have asked for a 
greater say in the strategic decisions 
that shape metropolitan Sydney, 
and their lives. This will require 
commitment and effort on the part of 
multiple organisations within our city, 
both, to engage communities and 
ensure their views are better reflected 
in metropolitan-scale decisions. 
The first step is connecting 
community research and 
engagement practitioners - the 
people within these organisations 
with deep understanding of 
community views and priorities, and 
specialist expertise in the design, 
delivery, analysis and reporting of 
engagement activities. Sydney’s 
practitioners are already delivering 
innovative activities within their 

individual organisations, and are 
well-placed to advocate for the 
inclusion of community views in 
key decisions. They are developing 
options for the co-design of 
engagement platforms, processes, 
tools and communications that 
people want to use.
This action began in May 2017 with 
meetings of Sydney’s government 
engagement practitioners in a new 
network. The network will:

 o  identify community priorities 
across metropolitan Sydney

 o build data around current 

engagement practice
 o explore best practice  

and innovation

 o build professional capacity  
 o develop consistent standards for 
how we engage communities in 
the decisions that affect them.

The network will explore community 
engagement in strategic decisions 
that address metropolitan scale 
risks, challenges and investments. In 
other global cities, these decisions 
are made through techniques like  
large, representative community 
reference panels. The network will 
explore these techniques for Sydney. 
The network will enable engagement 
practitioners to work together to 
ensure those most impacted have a 
voice, and key strategic decisions are 
truly people-centred.

  Resilience value

This action will create a network of practitioners from diverse organisations and communities to collaborate for awareness and 
integration of community views within key planning and investment decisions. It will increase equity and self-regulation through 
more people-centred decisions.

Collaborate for cross-city active transport
Initiate: Practitioners network began May 2017

We face challenges around 
connections and mobility as our city 
grows. These issues become critical 
during shock events when transport 
options are limited. 
We are also increasingly sedentary 
and chronic lifestyle illnesses are 
impacting the health and wellbeing 
of our communities. 

This action will address these issues 
by connecting mobility and transport 
practitioners in a metropolitan 
network. The network will build 
capacity for collaboration and 
innovative solutions. Participants will 
implement these solutions to create 
active transport connections across 
metropolitan Sydney.

In May 2017 local and state 
government practitioners began to 
share knowledge on active transport 
management and policies. 
Over the coming years the network 
will explore opportunities for 
standards for a cross city bicycle 
network, bike share regulations, 
walkable neighbourhoods and 
integrated and accessible mobility 
planning. 

  Resilience value

By connecting diverse practitioners this action will build capacity for adaptive, integrated active transport that facilitates 
adaptation by enabling communities to manage their health and wellbeing, and safety during a crisis.

ACTION 5
Improve access to health precincts
Amplify: Advocacy

 

The costs and time of work related travel are a 
chronic stress on Sydney families where over 80% 
of all commuting still occurs in a private vehicle.
Work by Deloitte Western Sydney through the 
Shaping Future Cities project is creating strong 
local connections and economic transformation by 
enabling people to work close to where they live, 
reducing the time and cost of commutes. 
This action seeks to amplify work promoting flexible 
work arrangements, co-working spaces, digital 
tools, use of vacant suburban spaces for startups, 
and new training for young people. 
The Greater Sydney Commission are also 
highlighting the benefits of working close to home 
via the concept of a ‘30 minute city’ in the Greater 
Sydney Region Plan.

Accessing health precincts is difficult without 
access to private vehicles, especially in the 
growth areas of our city. Solutions are increasingly 
available and this action highlights three different 
approaches for wider adoption:

 o e-health initiative of Wollondilly Health Alliance, 

a partnership of local, state and federal 
governments has successfully trialled digital 
consultant appointments (e-health) in the 
growth areas of Sydney, reducing travel

 o advocacy for new on-demand health transport 

services in the Greater Sydney Region Plan

 o active transport plans with priority routes to and 

from health precincts.

“ Resilience is the habit 
of collaboration.”

ACTION 6
Build community capacity through co-design

ACTION 7
Advocate for affordable housing for everyone
Strengthen: Research

 

Sydney communities asked for more involvement in 
designing solutions for the issues that affect them, 
providing direct user experiences into decision 
making. Organisations such as The Australian 
Centre for Social Innovation, the Foundation 
for Young Australians and Youth Action are 
demonstrating the value of community involvement 
in designing and operating services with the 
communities who use them. These include child 
and youth services and family violence support 
services. Communities and people who participate 
learn new skills, make lasting connections and 
contribute their expert knowledge of the challenges 
to ensure services are effective in meeting their 
needs. Amplifying user engagement in service 
design and delivery will build the capacity of our 
community to solve resilience issues. This action will 
bring together partners to deliver a leadership paper 
and event, inviting policy change to engage more 
residents in the design and provision of services.

 

 

Housing affordability is a critical issue for 
communities across metropolitan Sydney. The 
financial accessibility of housing is determined 
through a complex set of market conditions, 
investment controls, tax settings, wage trends and 
city planning controls. This system is influenced by 
all three layers of government and the development 
and housing industries. 
Collective leadership across metropolitan Sydney 
is needed to develop an urban housing agenda 
to increase access to affordable housing for 
people on all incomes, and aiming to decrease 
homelessness. Coordination by collectives such as 
the Sydney Alliance are bringing focus to this issue. 
Resilient Sydney will support research towards a 
policy agenda that enables financially accessible 
housing for everyone. 

ACTION 8
Develop skills for equity
Strengthen: Information sharing

 

Opportunities and education are not the same for 
everyone in Sydney due to the uneven impact of 
chronic stresses across the city. Businesses, the 
community sector and governments already provide 
tools and services to help, but these are not well 
known. This action encourages organisations, 
especially councils, to digitally share and amplify 
initiatives that focus on improving equity through 
knowledge sharing with groups adversely affected, 
such as providing: 

 o affordable insurance for low income earners
 o financial literacy training for younger and  

older women

 o job retraining and skills development for over 50s
 o free English lessons for migrants and refugees 
 o drivers licence training for Indigenous and 

vulnerable young people to provide access to 
training and jobs.

Resilience challenge:  
Pressure on our health, the environment and economy

Our climate and weather are intense, chronic illness is increasing and our environment is  
under pressure.
Sydney’s weather is changing: the climate is getting hotter and storms are becoming wilder 
and more frequent. Sea levels are rising, and heatwaves, droughts and bushfires are becoming 
more frequent and more intense. These trends are forecast to continue14.

Extreme heat is our biggest risk. 
Vulnerable populations with an 
underlying illness are more likely to 
die in a heatwave. Heatwaves cause 
soaring demands for energy, water 
and health services15. Our primary 
growth areas in Western Sydney 
are located inland in relatively hotter 
areas. But new homes are usually 
not constructed to provide maximum 
protection from heatwaves and there 
is less tree canopy cover to reduce 
surface temperatures.

Our communities are less able to 
exercise outdoors in some  parts of 
the year due to heat, and we have 
rising incidents of chronic disease 
such as obesity and diabetes. 
Chronic illness and lifestyle diseases 
are now the highest causes of death 
in Sydney. 
Our electricity network is  reliable, 
but extreme weather causes 
problems. Wild storms bring down 
power lines. Demand soars when 

people  use their air conditioning 
during heatwaves and refrigerators 
work overtime. Extreme weather 
is the biggest cause of electricity 
network failure, along with flooding.  
The growth of investment in 
innovative energy, water and mobility 
technologies is impacted by market 
settings. The private sector is already 
investing in more resilient built 
environment and infrastructure.

Extreme weather
 o In an average year Parramatta already 

experiences 13 days where temperatures 
are 35 degrees and over.

 o Cities are often hotter than surrounding 

areas. This is because we clear 
vegetation and replace it with concrete, 
bitumen and other heat absorbing 
materials, resulting in energy 
being trapped in city buildings and 
infrastructure. This is then radiated back 
out, heating the air and people.

Chronic disease
 o Around 50% of our population is 

overweight or obese – 45% of people  
in the north and 55% of people in  
the west16.

Open space and biodiversity
 o Every 10 per cent increase in tree 
canopy can reduce land surface 
temperatures by 1.13 degrees C17. 

 o Average tree canopy cover for urban 
NSW (including metropolitan Sydney 
and Newcastle) is 26.64% in 2016, down 
0.83% from 27.47% in 200918.

We make changes to sustain our quality of  
life and our environment.

This direction aligns to:

Our community are concerned about the risks posed by 
extreme weather, and the daily impacts of a changing 
climate. They have asked for actions to make homes and 
neighbourhoods safe, green and liveable. 
Consultation also revealed a need to improve understanding 
of risks and impacts as being key in  preparing our 
community and our city. 
Our city, state and nation have made global commitments to 
make the changes necessary to live with, and adapt to, our 
climate. These necessitate an understanding of how our city 
contributes to local and global climate changes, as well as 
actions to manage and mitigate risks.
As we build our capacity to manage extreme weather, it is vital 
we grow our economy by leveraging the market development 
and employment opportunities that arise as we put ideas into 
action.
This direction addresses community priorities and our 
challenges via the following guiding principles:                                                                            
Local adaptation
We will build awareness of risks and capacity for local action 
to manage extreme weather and changes to our climate 
across our city. 
Global performance
We will honour our global commitments to understand our 
contributions to our changing climate and manage and 
mitigate the risks posed by extreme weather.
A diverse economy
We will invest in diverse technologies and tools for mobility, 
energy, water supply and resilient buildings and infrastructure 
to build new markets and jobs in our economy.

Flagship action: Cool suburbs - turn down the heat

ACTION 9

 

Policy and action to cool homes and streets 
Initiate: Program began 2017

 

Extreme heat is our biggest risk 
in terms of shocks. It affects all 
our communities, with those in 
western Sydney experiencing the 
most significant impacts including 
decreasing safety, health, wellbeing, 
and increasing living costs.
Reducing impacts for western 
Sydney requires large scale 
collective action. The first step is 
connecting all the organisations and 
individuals managing extreme heat 
and its impacts to build a consistent 
understanding and approach to the 
challenge.
This action began in 2017 when 
the Western Sydney Regional 
Organisation of Councils (WSROC) 
brought together a multi-stakeholder 
group involving state and local 
government, universities, business 

organisations, health agencies and 
scientific research institutions. 
Progress has been swift to date.  
The group has begun by:

 o establishing a backbone 

governance structure

 o establishing baseline data and 

commissioning new research

 o delivering two forums to review 
the issues and agree priorities
 o developing a “Cool Suburbs” 

strategy for rating housing estates 
and existing suburbs

 o advocating for  extreme  

heat management as a NSW 
Premier’s priority. 

The Cool Suburbs initiative will use 
the latest in data sensing, materials 
science, built environment planning 

and performance monitoring to offer 
a “Cool Score” for new and existing 
suburbs. It will pilot a voluntary 
measurement and performance tool 
to identify the places in a city that will 
be lower in temperature and more 
comfortable, productive and safer for 
humans in times of extreme heat. 
Cooling initiatives have already  
been tested in Sydney in terms of  
cost effectiveness, timeliness 
and effect. These include: cool 
roofs; permeable or porous roads, 
driveways and footpaths; cool 
building and shading designs; 
irrigation and tree canopy cover.  
This action will engage householders, 
developers, governments and 
businesses to implement practical 
changes to our streets and homes  
for a cooler, safer city. 

  Resilience value

This collaboration of diverse stakeholders is building a shared understanding and awareness of how to reduce 
the impact of extreme heat. They will integrate science, planning, product design and performance tools to reduce 
vulnerability of communities to extreme heat and support liveability and wellbeing. This new voluntary governance 
approach is pioneering self-regulation for managing climate risk in our city.

ACTION 10

 

Develop investment in resilient buildings, assets, precincts and cities
Strengthen: Tool development began 2017

 

Adapting our infrastructure and built 
environment to reduce the impacts 
of extreme weather is critical to 
maximise the safety and comfort 
of Sydney communities. Business 
is increasingly aware of the need 
to manage risks and understand 
interdependencies, as well as the 
potential for innovation and new 
economic opportunities.
Australia’s industry associations 
have began pioneering voluntary 
tools and processes for assessing 
building, infrastructure asset and 
precinct resilience. A range of tools is 
needed to support decision making 
about climate risks and adaptation 
priorities. Australian rating tools 

support businesses to quantify and 
explain their performance for local 
and international benchmarks for 
investment.
This action will support business-led 
decision making tools for asset and 
precinct resilience. Once adopted, 
these will enable future use of 
investment products that improve 
resilience such as resilience bonds. 
The following tools are now under 
development:

 o Buildings and precincts: Green

(GBCA): Green Star Resilience 
Innovation Challenge

 o Infrastructure assets:

 o Government infrastructure 

and asset interdependencies: 
NSW Office of Environment 
and Heritage is piloting a tool 
‘XDI – Sydney’ that quantifies 
risks to interdependent critical 
infrastructure in Sydney, to inform 
prudent investment, in partnership 
with the City of Sydney, Sydney 
Water, Transport for NSW, Sydney 
Trains, Roads and Maritime 
Services, and in consultation 
with emergency services and 
Infrastructure NSW.

  Resilience value

This action will build awareness and management of risk in investment decisions for buildings, infrastructure and 
places. It will ensure future investment focuses on adaptive technologies and tools.

Enable affordable access to renewable and resilient energy
Strengthen: Research began 2018

Access to secure, clean energy 
supply was a key concern for our 
community, particularly during 
extreme weather when network 
failures are most likely to occur. They 
saw renewable energy as a key 
solution, emphasising the importance 
of affordability for vulnerable people. 

This action has began, bringing new 
partners together to collaborate and 
develop a large scale renewable 
energy and energy storage model 
for take up byhouseholds in the city. 
The model will encourage institutional 
investment in household energy 
to make solar power accessible 
and affordable for more people. 

This is especially necessary in the 
hottest areas of our city where 
access to cheaper air conditioning 
can be lifesaving. Investment in 
complementary battery technology 
has the potential to provide local 
energy backup in times of peak 
demand, whilst also reducing our 
contribution to climate change. 

  Resilience value

This action will build awareness and management of risk in investment decisions for buildings, infrastructure and places. It will 
ensure future investment focuses on adaptive technologies and tools.

Adopt urban resilience in research and teaching curricula
Initiate: Curriculum development

Academic research and teaching 
need to support systemic 
and integrated planning and 
management of our city, buildings, 
infrastructure and places to improve 
resilience outcomes for metropolitan 
Sydney. This action will ensure 
tomorrow’s decision makers and 
influencers are able to understand 
and manage our risks as our city 
grows.
This action will bring international 
expertise on resilience curricula 
from 100 Resilient Cities’ Rebuild By 
Design program together with local 

academics, teachers and students. 
They will co-design resilience units 
and curricula applicable to high 
school, tertiary and vocational 
education in Sydney via a tried  
and tested engagement process 
used throughout the 100 Resilient  
Cities network. 
Sydney’s academic institutions are 
already engaging in international 
urban resilience research and local 
implementation practices. In 2016, 
the University of NSW appointed a 
professorial chair in architecture with 
a focus on urban disaster resilience. 

The University of Sydney, University 
of Technology Sydney and Western 
Sydney University have began 
integrating resilience content into 
courses. 
This process will bring a multi-
disciplinary approach to creating 
education focused on reducing 
inequity, adapting to a changing 
climate, growing innovation and the 
green economy, increasing social 
cohesion, emergency preparedness 
and collaborative governance for 
change. 

ACTION 13

 

Measure metropolitan carbon emissions and report on progress
Strengthen: Reporting at metropolitan scale

On a city, state and national level 
we have made global commitments 
for action that will contribute to 
managing and mitigating extreme 
weather in Sydney. Actions to 
meet commitments such as the 
Paris Climate Agreement must 
begin with an understanding of 
our current emissions across 
metropolitan Sydney. Individual 
councils have previously reported 
emissions, however fragmented 

governance across the city has 
made metropolitan data collection, 
reporting and action inconsistent. 
This action will pioneer a 
standardised metropolitan-wide 
process for measuring and reporting 
on carbon emissions in Sydney. This 
science-based approach will support 
decision making for action at the 
scale we need.  The opportunities 
for reducing emissions are different 
across the city. This process will 

support councils and communities  
to better understand how they can 
act, now. 
A network of councils will draw 
on data from the Greater Sydney 
Commission and expertise from the 
international C40 Cities program 
and the City of Sydney. The gaphill 
develop protocals, monitor, evaluate, 
repair and take action to monitor, 
evaluate, report and take action.

ACTION 14

 

Support a more flexible and resilient water cycle 
Strengthen: Advocacy for statutory policy

The Metropolitan Water Plan (2017), 
highlighted the need to diversify 
Sydney’s water cycle management 
to secure a liveable, growing and 
resilient Greater Sydney. Use of 
technologies such as water recycling 
of wastewater and stormwater are 
currently stifled by market settings 
and short term policies. A secure, 
flexible and resilient water supply is 

essential to manage the combined 
stresses of the combined stresses of 
ageing  infrastructure, growth, inequity 
and future shock events from extreme 
weather, such as droughts and 
heatwaves. 
More diverse water supplies are being 
achieved in other cities through long 
term policy with targets. This action 

will focus on securing agreement 
across government, business, market 
regulators and the community on 
practical policy and market settings. 
This will secure water over a 20-40 
year period, aligned to population 
growth and the Greater Sydney 
Region Plan and enable stable 
investment and implementation of  
a range of water technologies. 

ACTION 15

 

Reduce reliance on liquid fuel
Initiate: Resilience Challenge event

Sydney relies on overseas imports 
for 90% of our liquid fuel supply. This 
means we are significantly exposed 
to supply-chain disruptions. The 
functionality of our city depends on 
diversifying our fuel sources and 
increasing self-sufficiency.

This action seeks leadership 
and collaboration to develop a 
metropolitan plan to reduce the risks 
to our current mobility, whilst planning 
for new ways of powering transport 
technology in the future. Practical 
policy and market settings will be 
required for a 20-40 year period, 

aligned to population growth and the 
Greater Sydney Region Plan. A ‘City 
Resilience Challenge’ event will bring 
together organisations to research 
potential targets and policy for 
investment in more diverse transport 
options.

Resilience challenge: Declining social cohesion

Our communities are diverse and cohesive, but intolerance and inequity is growing.

We are a fast growing city with high 
levels of cultural diversity. Social 
cohesion has traditionally been high 
in Australian society, defined as 
the presence or absence of social 
trust and cooperation between 
citizens20. However, social cohesion 
between our different communities 
is decreasing, and social isolation is 
increasing. This undermines the vital 
connections we need to live well as 
well as how we respond together in a 
shock event. 

Sydney today is home to Australia’s 
largest population of Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples. We 
are also amongst the most culturally 
diverse cities on earth – 39% of us 
were born overseas and around 32% 
speak a language other than English 
at home.
Some parts of Sydney are extremely 
culturally diverse, while others are 
made up of communities where 
almost everyone has been settled 
in Australia for generations21.The 
extent to which we meet people 
from different cultural backgrounds 

depends largely on where we live 
and work. A lack of transport options 
inhibits our ability to visit different 
communities that have different 
cultural backgrounds. 
Tolerance of cultural diversity is 
declining in Sydney.22,23 Attitudes to 
cultural diversity are complicated and 
depend on many factors, but there is 
evidence that over time contact with 
different cultural groups decreases 
racism, and there very little increase 
in positive attitudes amongst those 
who live in areas of low diversity24.

Cultural diversity
 o We are more culturally diverse than 

London, Singapore and New York on 
the basis of number of people born 
elsewhere25.

 o Around 38% of Sydney households 

speak a language other than English  
at home26. 

Fragmentation 
 o In Parramatta 76% of people were born 

overseas, and twice as many people 
speak a language other than English at 
home than the national average30.

 o The ability to move around Sydney and 

interact with different cultural groups can  
be difficult due to poor transport links in 
areas with concentrations of different  
cultural groups31.

Intolerance
 o 54% of people in Sydney disagree with 
the statement ‘the government should 
assist with ethnic minorities’, compared 
with 44% of people from Melbourne27.

 o 25-27% of Sydneysiders expressed 
negative or strong negative attitudes 
towards Muslims, compared to 16% of 
people surveyed in Melbourne28. 

 o Further research has found Muslim, 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  
and African people experience high 
levels of discrimination. 77% of South 
Sudanese people surveyed reported 
experiencing discrimination29.

Direction 3   o   Connect for strengthConnect for strength objective

Every Sydneysider will feel they belong in our 
community, and our city.

This direction aligns to:

Our community have expressed concerns about declining 
social cohesion. They have asked for action to ensure the 
diversity of our people and the strength of local connections 
is valued to maintain a cohesive, inclusive and prosperous 
metropolitan city. 
This is supported by studies that show close knit, cohesive 
communities are better prepared for shocks and respond  
and recover faster than those where there is tension. 
Consultation also highlighted the importance of 
acknowledging, embracing and learning from Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples, the world’s oldest continuous 
living culture. 
Finally, building opportunities for economic and civic 
participation for all our communities is critical for ensuring 
everyone is able to prosper and thrive across our city.
As we take action to improve social cohesion and inclusion, 
we will be guided by the following principles:                                                  
A welcoming city:
We will measure and prioritise social cohesion across 
our metropolitan city as an important factor to our ability 
to respond and recover from disasters. We will build 
opportunities for communities to connect across metropolitan 
Sydney, and actions to promote safety and tolerance in 
everyday interactions.
Resilient Cultures:
We will acknowledge and embrace Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples and cultures in our city’s past, present 
and future.
Inclusion and participation:
We will create opportunities for all our cultural communities 
to participate in leadership positions in our organisations to 
ensure everyone in our city can thrive and prosper. This will 
include engaging in ongoing dialogue about racial equity  
and identity.

monitoring and understanding 
of social cohesion and levels of 
tolerance and wellbeing across 
our metropolitan city has been 
fragmented and inconsistent. A 
coordinated approach is required to 
improve our understanding of how 
to most effectively and efficiently 
support and invest in community 
cohesion.
This action will connect practitioners 
across government, business, social 
services and the community to share 
the range of wellbeing indicators 

already being used by councils such 
as the City of Sydney and Parramatta, 
and State government agencies 
across Sydney. These include 
metrics such as level of community 
connectedness, networks, or close 
personal relationships and measures 
of trust. This action will identify and 
convene a ‘community of interest’ 
of organisations with expertise and 
data, including those with experience 
of measuring household financial 
wellbeing. They are:

 o Identifying existing data and gaps;
 o Developing a collaborative 

structure and process for working 
together; 

 o Exploring how collaborative 

reporting responsibility could be 
managed;

 o Commissioning research to 

understand global best practice;

 o Co-designing frameworks, 

measures, tools and reporting 
protocols.

Understanding and tracking cohesion 
and wellbeing will enable evaluation 
of current programs and evidence-
based decision making for our 
future. This action will inform the 
effectiveness of other strategy actions 
and enable measurement of wider city 
resilience in Sydney.

  Resilience value

This action will increase awareness of social cohesion and community wellbeing and build awareness of risks. 
It will build capacity for integrated, adaptive, evidence-based decision making that improves social cohesion. 
Collaboration between diverse stakeholders will build capacity for stable governance.

ACTION 17

Learning from First Nations Elders and community  
leaders – experts in resilience and survival
Strengthen: Stage 1 engagement complete 2018, report to be shared 
 

 

Sydney is home to the largest 
population of Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples in Australia. 
The major shock event of colonisation 
impacted these communities and 
has created ongoing experiences 
of stresses around racism, child 
removal, inequity and displacement. 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples are experts in long term 
resilience and intergenerational 
survival that must inform Sydney’s 
ongoing understanding and actions 
for resilience. 
In 2017, Resilient Sydney engaged 
a First Nations engagement 
consultancy to consult with Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander Elders and 
community leaders. Consultation 
focused on understanding and 
valuing the qualities of Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples that 
have enabled them to survive, adapt 
and thrive as the world’s longest 
continuous living cultures, some 
potential actions and the processes 
for co-designing actions in future.

They identified the following qualities 
as critical to survival:

 o connections to family, community, 

culture and country

 o sharing – helping anyone who 
needs it, even if you don’t have 
much yourself

 o a strong work ethic, innovation, 
self-sufficiency and the ability to 
‘just get on with it’

 o identity – a strong cultural and 
community identity with Elders 
imparting cultural information, 
modelling strength and resilience 
and quietly taking care of those 
in need.

Elders and community leaders 
identified a strong need for visibility of 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples and cultures within the 
broader Sydney community, as well 
as an understanding of First Nations 
peoples’ contributions to our city. 
They emphasised a core need for 
respect, recognition and ‘truth telling’ 
in moving forward. 

Existing consultative bodies such 
as Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander community advisory panels 
working with councils, key Aboriginal 
organisations and grassroots forums 
with Elders and young people were 
identified as the best ways to engage 
and  develop our actions. It will 
be important these are broad and 
representative, seeking a diversity 
of views within the community 
and focusing on co-creation and 
implementation of actions.
The next steps for Resilient  
Sydney are:

 o sharing the outcomes with 

stakeholders and organisations 
across metropolitan Sydney

 o highlighting findings to the global 

100 Resilient Cities network
 o working with Aboriginal and 

Torres Strait Islander people in 
co-creation and decision making 
to develop the actions.

  Resilience value

This action will increase visibility and awareness across metropolitan Sydney to value the contributions and 
adaptive leadership of First Nations peoples, whilst developing initiatives to address inequity and promote inclusive, 
integrated decision making.

Support communities to know their neighbours
Amplify: Community information

Consultation has highlighted the need for greater 
community connections to build tolerance and  
cohesion, reduce social isolation and increase safety  
in times of crisis.
This action seeks to amplify current initiatives  
provided by business, government or the community 
sector with a proven record for increasing connections. 
We will encourage participation by individuals and 
organisations across metropolitan Sydney. Initiatives 
include the following: 

 

 o Good Hoods – an IAG initiative to connect 

communities so they are ‘ready for anything’ through 
initiatives such as weekly neighbourhood barbecues, 
creating local community safety groups, volunteering 
and sharing skills or training

 o Joining-the-dots – connecting newly arrived residents 

with established Australians over ‘Welcome Dinners’

 o Neighbour Day – an annual celebration of community 

where people connect with their neighbours over 
coffee, picnics, barbeques and events, held in March 
each year. 

“ It’s easier to go.  
And it’s harder to 
stay. Because if 
you stay [in the 
community] you 
have got to do 
something.”

Amplify: Advocacy for wider promotion

 

Studies have shown increasing interactions between 
different cultural communities can contribute to 
improving tolerance and respect. Our community 
was concerned about the lack of interaction of 
communities in different parts of Sydney. This action 
asks community groups and organisations running 
cultural festivals and activities to create campaigns 
and promotions that specifically target communities 
in other parts of metropolitan Sydney. This will 
encourage people to experience different cultures in 
parts of Sydney they might not normally visit.

This action responds to concerns about intolerance 
of cultural diversity. The action will engage 
organisations to promote initiatives to residents 
and employees that enable understanding of 
the experiences of people of different cultural 
communities. 
This includes the following two initiatives:

 o an immersive game/education app called 

Challenging Racism, challenging participants to 
spend a week ‘walking in the shoes’ of a Muslim 
woman, Aboriginal man or Indian student. 
They receive texts, tweets, images and videos 
that challenge assumptions and highlight the 
importance of bystander action against racism

 o promote the outcomes of two metropolitan 

Sydney councils who allowed teams to 
‘swap’ locations, other schools, councils and 
organisations will be encouraged to swap and 
spend time participating in work, education and/
or social activities in another part of Sydney. 

“ The strength of Parramatta is 
the diversity of the culture and 
the accessibility of the local 
area, the shops, different kind

Support diversity in leadership
Strengthen: Advocacy for organisational policy

 

The mix of people in key city institutions and 
leadership positions does not represent or reflect 
the variety of people and cultural groups in our 
city population. Better inclusion will reduce cultural 
bias and improve opportunities for participation 
in employment for different cultural groups, and 
increase productivity for our city.
This action asks organisations to support and 
promote diversity. Efforts can focus on providing 
civic leadership opportunities for people from 
Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) groups, 
and organisational change in the recruitment and 
retention of employees.

This action was developed by a member of the 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community 
during consultation, and highlighted as important for 
increasing visibility and respect by Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander Elders and community leaders.
This action more organisations, households and 
public events to publicly acknowledge the place 
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 
in metropolitan Sydney on a routine basis. 
Reconciliation Australia1 defines Welcome to Country 
and Acknowledgement of Country protocol, shown 
in the box below. 
Acknowledging country, people, language and 
culture is a simple and important step to express 
cultural respect and understanding. Welcome 
to Country and Acknowledgement of Country 
ceremonies could be extended to visitors as they 
arrive in Sydney, such as cruise ship terminals, 
Central train station, in clubs, local sporting events, 
community get-togethers and in our homes. This 
work has begun at Sydney’s airport as part of their 
Reconciliation Action Plan. 

The Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country protocol,  
from Reconciliation Australia:  

"Protocols for welcoming visitors to Country have been 
a part of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures 
for thousands of years. Despite the absence of fences 
or visible borders, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
groups had clear boundaries separating their Country 
from that of other groups. Crossing into another group’s 
Country required a request for permission to enter. 
When permission was granted the hosting group would 
welcome the visitors, offering them safe passage and 
protection of their spiritual being during the journey. 
While visitors were provided with a safe passage, they 
also had to respect the protocols and rules of the land 
owner group while on their Country.  … the essential 
elements of welcoming visitors and offering safe passage 

remain in place. A Welcome to Country occurs at the 
beginning of a formal event and can take many forms 
including singing, dancing, smoking ceremonies or a 
speech in traditional language or English. A Welcome to 
Country is delivered by Traditional Owners, or Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander people who have been given 
permission from Traditional Owners, to welcome visitors 
to their Country. An Acknowledgement of Country is an 
opportunity for anyone to show respect for Traditional 
Owners and the continuing connection of Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples to Country. It can be given 
by both non-Indigenous people and Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people."

Resilience challenge:  
Lack of understanding of risks and interdependencies

Like people everywhere, Sydneysiders rely on infrastructure and essential services that  
provide our food, energy and water, telecommunications, transport, and manage our waste34. 
They are owned and managed by a patchwork of different organisations, both government  
and private businesses. All these assets and services are intricately connected and  
disruptions can have knock-on effects with serious impacts across city systems. As these 
systems become more complex, it is crucial each organisation understands their connections 
and roles in managing risks.

The Australian Business Roundtable 
for Disaster Resilience has 
highlighted private sector concern 
by clarifying the high economic and 
social costs of shock events that 
affect Australia and Sydney. Their 
studies have shown that in 2015 the 
cost of natural disasters to Australia 
was around $9 billion. It is estimated 
this will rise to $33 billion per year 
by 2050, with the actual figure likely 
to be much higher as this does not 
factor in the impacts of extreme 
heat, or climate change35. In Sydney, 
twenty-four hours of disruption to 
transport networks due to weather 
events could reduce GDP by $30 

million, much of which could not 
be recovered through insurance36. 
Other social and community impacts 
of disasters in Sydney are not well 
understood.  
The UN Sendai Framework for 
Disaster Risk Reduction highlights 
the urgent need for collective 
understanding, preparedness 
and action to secure a substantial 
reduction in loss of life and 
damage to livelihoods, property, 
economies and social structures 
from catastrophic disasters37. This 
is reflected on a national, state and 
local level via legislation, strategy 
and guidelines including the National 

Strategy for Disaster Resilience38, 
the NSW State Emergency Plan39, 
NSW Emergency Risk Management 
Framework40  and Local Emergency 
Planning Guidelines41.  
The number of extreme weather 
events that require response 
services are increasing in our city. 
These events impact parts of our 
city differently, with some places 
particularly vulnerable to certain 
risks. As our city grows, we need 
more people and organisations to 
understand risks and engage in 
building resilience in their local area. 

People, organisations  
and planning
 o Place based disaster planning of  

critical infrastructure is common in  
other countries.

 o 89% of major businesses have business 

continuity/disaster recovery plans44 

Community engagement and 
volunteering
 o 18% of people over 15 years old in 

Sydney volunteer for an organisation  
or group45

 o Less than 5 per cent of people in 
Australia are trained in first aid46.

Connected city systems
 o Almost every service we rely on every 

day needs electricity to function, 
especially internet and communications 
technology42. 

 o Only 20% of Sydney’s food comes from 
the Sydney basin43. That means 80% of 
our food comes from somewhere else, 
on trucks, trains, ships and planes which 
all need fuel.

Direction 4   o   Get readyGet ready objective

We know how to manage risks to prepare, 
respond and recover

Global, federal, state and local strategy and legislation 
consistently highlights the need for a greater understanding of 
risk and collective responsibility for preparedness, response 
and recovery. Coordination across government, business and 
communities is identified as a key priority. 
The NSW Government “Get Ready NSW” program 
encourages the community to be aware of risks and prepare 
for all hazards. This complements the extensive suite of 
community preparedness campaigns and initiatives being 
undertaken by NSW emergency service agencies across the 
Greater Sydney Region . Examples include

 o NSW State Emergency Service Get Ready for Flood, 

Storm and Tsunami preparedness campaigns and local 
engagement activities including Community Action Teams
 o NSW Rural Fire Service bushfire preparedness initiatives 
including Prepare, Act Survive campaign and Get Ready 
community engagement activities

 o Fire and Rescue NSW Home Fire Safety preparedness 

The business community have emphasised the need for 
investment in disaster resilience.
Our community have expressed serious concern about being 
unprepared for disasters. They have asked for actions to help 
them understand risks and increase preparedness while also 
facilitating local connections and building cohesion.
Organisations responsible for critical infrastructure and 
essential services need to understand their connections within 
city systems, the ways these systems react during disruption 
and their role in managing risks. This understanding should 
be supported by planning for infrastructure and assets that 
are diversified and capable of ensuring essential businesses 
and services continue running during shock events.  
Finally we must build understanding of the specific 
vulnerabilities and risks we face in each of the different places 
in our city, and develop local action and capacity.
This direction addresses global, federal, state and local 
strategy and legislation, while responding to community and 
private sector concern.  In understanding risks and preparing 
for disaster we will be guided by the following principles:                                           
A prepared community
We will understand the community and social impacts of 
disasters across our city. 
We will build the capacity of our community to understand 
and manage local risks while developing strong, cohesive 
neighbourhoods and districts.

Resilient Organisations
We will engage organisations to understand their connections 
and roles in managing risks across our city.  This includes 
considering threats, hazards and disruptions as we plan, 
build and replace critical infrastructure and assets to reduce 
risks to life and property, and ensure our city continues to 
function during and after disasters.
Understanding risks and vulnerabilities 
We will work together to build awareness of the specific 
vulnerabilities and risks we face in different parts of our city. 
We will build local capacity to manage and mitigate these 
vulnerabilities and risks.

Get Prepared – 100,000 ready Sydneysiders
Strengthen: App launched 2018

Engagement revealed serious 
community concern over a lack 
of community preparedness for 
emergencies. The community 
were also aware of the need to 
strengthen local connections to 
ensure support and safety is close by 
during disasters. Strong, connected 
communities have the added benefit 
of increasing social cohesion across 
our city. 
The number of households taking 
action to prepare in Sydney is 
unknown and effort is required to 
encourage take up and report results.  
The Red Cross and IAG have 
co-created the Get Prepared app. 
The app is a free and easy to use, 
one-stop tool to help community 

members prepare for any type of 
emergency by:

 o establishing a quick and easy 

network of support with three key 
contacts

 o promoting review of the risks 

relevant to where they live

 o providing checklists of actions to 

make an emergency plan

 o saving the emergency plan as a 

PDF to be printed and shared  
with others.

The app builds on many years of 
work by governments and the Red 
Cross to help people prepare both 
physically and psychologically 
for disaster. It helps community 
members during emergencies 

by promoting connection to their 
relevant local emergency services 
orgnisation. It prompts them to 
prepare an emergency plan tailored 
to their needs. 
Resilient Sydney will support the 
work with Sydney Councils, the Red 
Cross, IAG, the Australian Business 
Roundtable for Disaster Resilience 
and Safer Communities and partners 
to promote the app across Sydney 
and report on how it is used. We 
will develop a strategic campaign 
targeting  government, business 
and community services. The 
campaign will promote the program 
to organisations to recruit their staff, 
customers and city residents to 
download the app and undertake 
preparedness activities. 

  Resilience value

Local government plays a vital role 
in risk management and emergency 
prevention, preparedness, response 
and recovery. They connect local 
communities to other organisations 
and agencies in times of disruption, 
but they need support to integrate 
with critical infrastructure providers, 
run exercise scenarios and help our 
communities prepare.
The NSW Office of Emergency 
Management (OEM) has initiated a 

pilot Disaster Preparedness  
Program to build resilience across 
NSW. The program focuses on 
building awareness of disaster 
resilience issues and responsibilities 
through emergency risk 
assessments, emergency exercise 
planning and general emergency 
management training. 
Resilient Sydney will work with the 
OEM to support the urban based pilot 
in the City of Sydney. OEM’s Disaster 

Preparedness Project Officers will

Mapping vulnerabilities at a District planning level
Initiate: Research from 2019

The shocks identified by Resilient 
Sydney threaten our entire 
metropolitan city, but their impacts 
vary depending on the diversity of 
the geography, communities and 
resources in each area. Increasing 
the capacity of our city to manage 
disasters involves understanding the 
specific risks and vulnerabilities facing 
each different part of Sydney and 
capturing those in the land use and 
strategic planning processes  
of government. 
This action will address these 
concerns by mapping risks and 
vulnerabilities across a district 

of metropolitan Sydney in a pilot 
community vulnerability assessment 
process. The first step is collating 
digital mapping layers across 
agencies 
This supports delivery of the Greater 
Sydney Region Plan direction for, 
‘A resilient city’. The need for a 
comprehensive understanding of 
local issues is recognised in the NSW 
Emergency Management Plan. 
A multidisciplinary team will be 
created in the pilot area. The first step 
will be to share mapping data and 
determine a community vulnerability 

checklist for specific places in the city. 
Data from tools such 100 Resilient 
Cities’ Assets and Risks tool will 
inform the potential for community 
impacts from disasters.
This process will enable reporting of 
community vulnerabilities that may be 
used when prioritising investment in 
disaster mitigation projects. 

  Resilience value

This action will build awareness and understanding of risks and vulnerabilities across Sydney. This will allow integrated, 
adaptive actions tailored to the diverse people, organisations and places across our city. This action is critical for good 
governance to prepare for, respond to and bounce back from shock events within Sydney.

Develop a Critical Infrastructure Resilience Strategy 
Initiate: Discussion Paper in 2017

We face increasing risks from shock 
events and our city systems are 
becoming more complex. There is a 
pressing need to ensure the critical 
infrastructure systems we rely on 
function effectively in the face of 
disruption, regardless of who owns 
or manages this infrastructure. 
This will help secure our social 
wellbeing, economic prosperity and 
environmental values for our city. 
The NSW government has 
commenced the development 
of a Critical Infrastructure 
Resilience Strategy. The strategy 
is being developed under the 
NSW Emergency Management 
and Disaster Resilience Review 
(EMDRR), in conjunction with the 
NSW Emergency Risk Management 
Framework and the 2017 State Level 
Emergency Risk Assessment. 
 

The strategy will ensure Sydney’s 
critical infrastructure is able to:

The benefits of the strategy  
will include:

 o withstand shocks and continue 

to operate in shock events

 o return to service as soon as 

possible after disruption

 o respond to long-term stresses.

The NSW Office of Emergency 
Management has developed the 
NSW Critical Infrastructure Resilience 
Strategy Discussion Paper, 2017 
and engaged with industry, local 
government and other stakeholders. 
The strategy will provide a definition 
of critical infrastructure along with 
proposed principles, actions and 
outcomes. This strategy offers a new 
place-based approach to integrated 
emergency management of the city 
systems that support the lives of five  
million people in Sydney.
 
 

 o enhanced resilience for 
critical infrastructure by 
recognising vulnerabilities and 
interdependencies. This will 
reduce service disruptions 
as well as the costs of asset 
ownership, maintenance and 
management

 o enhanced emergency 

management arrangements for 
our communities

 o stronger relationships between 

government, business and 
communities

 o insurance premiums for critical 
infrastructure that consider the 
benefits of resilience, adaptation 
and mitigation investment.

Resilient Sydney will also promote 
the Strategy and work of the OEM 
throughout our networks.

Evaluate the community impacts of disasters
Initiate: Research completed 2018

There is currently little information 
on how communities experience 
disasters beyond the costs of 
immediate insurance claims.  
This means the long term 
psychological, social and financial 
impacts borne by individuals and 
communities are unquantified and 
invisible. This makes the case for 
investment in mitigation difficult.

In 2017 Resilient Sydney partnered 
with the University of Sydney to 
undertake research with communities 
that have experienced recent shock 
events across metropolitan Sydney. 
The research is funded by the NSW 
Office of Emergency Management 
under the Community Resilience 
Innovation Program. 

Focus groups with communities were 
completed in 2017 with the support of 
Sydney councils, and a report will be 
released in 2018 outlining key themes 
and outcomes. The report shares a 
series of policy recommendations 
for government organisations, 
businesses and communities to 
reduce the social and community 
borne costs of shock events.

Support small businesses to manage cybersecurity 
Amplify: Community information

 

Cybersecurity is one of the biggest

impacts of cybercrime are significant 
and small businesses are particularly 
vulnerable.
In 2017, the NSW Small Business

government agencies to investigate 
and publish awareness and attitudes 

towards cybercrime across small to 
medium enterprises in Australia in 
the Cyber Aware National Report. 
The Commission also conducted a 
targeted study of NSW businesses. 
The Cyber Scare Report found 
that 93% of small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) want access to 
risk management tools to help them 
protect their business from cyber 
crime. The Commission publish and 
promote recommendations for actions 

businesses can take to protect 
against cyber crime. 
This action will promote small 
business engagement in cyber 
preparedness and act on the 
recommendations of the Commission 
through council networks, local 
business support programs and 
financial institutions and peak bodies 
with a significant client base of small 
to medium businesses.

“ By working 
with all tiers of 
government and 
business, we look 
forward to creating 
a stronger, safer, 
more connected 
Sydney for 
everyone.”

ACTION 29

 

Help communities to train and volunteer to prepare for disasters
Strengthen: Community preparedness

Engagement revealed serious 
community concern over lack of 
preparedness for emergencies. The 
community was  also aware of the 
need to strengthen local connections 
to ensure support and safety is 
close by during disasters. Training 
and volunteering are key ways of 
increasing preparedness, reducing 
anxiety and forging strong local 
connections.
This action highlights the excellent 
work of government, non-government 
organisations and business in 
providing certified and informal 
training and volunteering options. 
This information will be shared by 

councils. More people across Sydney 
will be encouraged to support their 
community in an emergency through:

 o first aid training – for example, 

the Red Cross, St John’s 
Ambulance, education and 
training institutions and private 
businesses

 o volunteering before and during 

emergencies – NSW for example 
such as the State Emergency 
Service, Rural Fire Service,  
St John Ambulance as well as 
organisations such as the Red 
Cross, NSW Volunteer Rescue 
Association and Volunteering NSW

 o volunteering to care for 

vulnerable people and pets 
for example – Volunteering 
Australia, community services 
organisations, charities, the 
Good Hoods program

 o events that build capacity and 
increase awareness – such as 
Hawkesbury Council’s Festival of 
the Flood, NSW State Emergency 
Service 'Get Ready for Flood', 
and NSW Rural Fire Service 'Get 
Ready Weekened'.

Strong, connected communities have 
the added benefit of increasing social 
cohesion across our city.

ACTION 30

 

Inform risks and ratings with open source data
Strengthen: Advocacy for open data

Communities lack awareness of 
the risks we face from extreme 
heat, bushfires, storms and floods. 
More transparently communicating 
these risks will improve awareness 
and lead to a reduction in property 
damage, risk to lives and call-outs for 
emergency services. 
The first steps involve connecting all 

relevant agencies, businesses and 
organisations who currently have a 
role in understanding, managing and 
communicating these risks to explore 
data availability, methodologies 
for data sharing, reporting and risk 
assessment. There is an opportunity 
to establish consistent and integrated 
protocols for communicating risks. 

Resilient Sydney will advocate for 
public availability of open data sets 
relevant to Sydney’s shocks and 
stresses. More open data between 
business and government will support 
zoning, state planning policies, 
building regulations and insurance 
policies for at-risk parts of our city.

Part B - Our City    |    105

Resilience challenge:  
Disjointed governance

Sydney is not governed as a single city. The three layers of government with jurisdiction over 
Sydney have overlapping responsibilities for supporting the economy, the environment and the 
communities of the city. 

More than 100 government entities, 
agencies and departments have 
some level of policy or operational 
control. These organisations 
gather data, make decisions and 
undertake actions and investments 
that determine how our city systems 
function. However the people in 
these organisations are not in the 
same location, may not know each 
other, and often have differing 
priorities.  

This is not optimal. Disjointed 
governance makes integrated 
decision making difficult, and 
impacts on people’s experience 
of living in Sydney. It also makes it 
difficult to obtain a clear picture of 
the metropolitan scale risks facing 
our city, or where the responsibility 
for managing different risks rests 
between agencies, government  
or business. 

Analysis shows an inability to 
coordinate decision making 
and action has at the very least 
exacerbated our challenges, and in 
some cases contributed to the risks 
we face. The experience of other 
major international cities shows the 
increasing scale of disasters and 
disruptions can overwhelm  
the capacity of governments 
to respond and new integrated 
approaches are required.

Operating Sydney
 o There are over 100 organisations with 

some level of control in operating 
and managing key city systems that 
sustain our lives and economy in 
metropolitan Sydney. Sectors include 
government, water, electricity, transport, 
telecommunications, emergency 
services and food provision. 

 o Our metropolis has many state and local 

government organisations with varying 
size and capability. Councils in Sydney 
range in population size from 7,000 up to 
over 300,000. 

 o The NSW Government has 10 key 

government departments with some 
level of policy, budget and operational 
control of how Sydney works. There are 
many 100 state government agencies 
operating in Sydney.

Direction 5   o   One city"One City" objective

We are one city.

This direction aligns to:

Action to address our challenges requires connected, 
collaborative leadership. All parts of Sydney – business, 
community, government, academia and the media – must 
work together. 
This means adopting resilience thinking in organisations 
across diverse areas, from urban renewal planning and 
development, to transport, social infrastructure and service 
delivery, to climate change adaptation and emergency 
preparedness planning. 
Resilience thinking involves understanding metropolitan scale 
interdependencies and risks, and our role in managing these 
risks, as well as committing to including the most impacted in 
our decision making. Above all it involves working with others 
across layers, areas of responsibility, business sectors and 
communities to share knowledge and take action.
In engaging people and organisations to build our resilience 
we will be guided by the following principles:                                                           
Increase leadership and governance for resilience
We will engage organisations to make a commitment to 
collective city leadership through collaboration for resilience 
thinking and action. We will learn from the collective 
experience and advice of elders from all of our different 
cultural and interest groups across metropolitan Sydney.
Share knowledge, create connections:
We will create digital platforms and opportunities for 
networking, sharing knowledge and collaborating across 
metropolitan Sydney. 
We will continue to share and learn from other cities in the 100 
Resilient Cities Network.
Build collaboration and measure change:
The Resilient Sydney Office will be maintained and supported 
as the structure that catalyses and enables collaboration and 
transformation in metropolitan Sydney.
As core to this role, the Resilient Sydney Office will also steer 
measurement and monitoring of transformation across our city.

Flagship action 

ACTION 31

 

Engage 100 organisations in the Sydney Resilience Commitment 
Initiate: Program begins 2019

during shock events. They will 
demonstrate innovation and 
market leadership, and improve 
the wellbeing and prosperity of our 
community. 
A commitment means each 
organisation will:

 o understand metropolitan scale 
community risks, as well as the 
‘local’ place-based risks each 
organisation faces

 o clarify the role of each 

organisation in managing and 
mitigating risks

 o engage with the people in the city 
most impacted by your decision 
making

 o engage in training and capacity 

building across each organisation 

 o collaborate to develop an action 

plan for your organisation

 o undertake action and investment.
The Resilient Sydney Office will draw 
on research from groups such as 
the Resilient Expert Advisory Group 
(REAG), Organisational Resilience 
(New Zealand) and Risk Frontiers at 
Macquarie University who have all 
identified the need for organisations 
to better understand how potential 
shocks and stressed will impact 
their business and cities. The 
Resilient Sydney Office will begin 
implementation throughout 2018-19. 
A number of organisations and peak 
bodies have expressed willingness to 
make the commitment and promote 
it through their members and 
networks. 

Lack of understanding of 
metropolitan scale risks and 
interdependencies, lack of people-
centred decisions, and a tendency 
to operate in silos has both caused 
and exacerbated our challenges. 
Building our city’s resilience requires 
purposeful, coordinated action. 
The first step is building commitment. 
We invite all government, business, 
academic and community sector 
organisations in metropolitan 
Sydney to commit to supporting the 
implementation of this strategy by 
building their capacity to understand 
and manage vulnerabilities, 
interdependencies and risks for 
everyone in metropolitan Sydney. 
By taking this commitment, 
organisations will ensure continuity 
and safety for their customers, 
employees and local communities 

  Resilience value

The commitment will be a vital step in increasing understanding across a diversity of sectors and organisations. The 
commitment will enable adaptive, integrated planning and action and is central to good governance to manage disruptions 
in our city.

Supporting action

ACTION 32

 

Maintain and support the Resilient Sydney Office
Strengthen: Backbone office began 2015

Building resilience in our city will not 
happen by accident. A coordinated 
response that harnesses resilience 
thinking will require dedicated 
adaptive leadership. The Resilient 
Sydney Office has played that role 
to date in raising awareness of the 
challenges facing our city and the 
value of a resilience approach. 
The office has already successfully 
engaged and inspired organisations 
to take collective action, as evidenced 
in the activities in this strategy  
already underway.
This action involves ongoing 
maintenance and support of 
the Resilient Sydney Office as 
a metropolitan collaboration of 
councils, government, business 
and the community. The office will 
be guided by the Resilient Sydney 
Steering Committee. The office 
will build understanding, capacity 
and collaboration across all layers 
of government, business and the 

community to realise our vision for 
resilience in Sydney. 
The Resilient Sydney Office will:

 o advocate for coordinated 

understanding, governance, 
investment and action to address 
our challenges 

 o undertake research and 

engagement to support an 
understanding of resilience 
across metropolitan Sydney and 
work continue to develop this 
strategy and its actions

 o undertake continuous learning to 
build the body of knowledge and 
practice around city resilience 
within metropolitan Sydney, 
Australia and with the other cities 
in the 100 Resilient Cities network
 o create and maintain opportunities 
for networking, collaboration and 
innovation across metropolitan 
Sydney

 o co-design a measurement, 
monitoring and evaluation 
framework and reporting process 
for this strategy.

The Resilient Sydney office will provide:

 o research on metropolitan scale 

community risks

 o templates and guidelines for 

identifying local risks, clarifying 
the  role of participating 
organisations and setting an 
action plan

 o training programs and best 

practice examples on governance 
structures

 o mechanisms for networking 
 o a monitoring and evaluation 

framework and mechanisms for 
reporting.

  Resilience value

This action will increase understanding, awareness and capacity, it will enable integrated, adaptive action and leadership, and 
promote good governance across a diversity of sectors within our city systems.

Measure resilience and wellbeing to monitor and evaluate our goals
Initiate: Reporting for Sydney

 

 

Quantifying the benefits of taking 
action for resilience is key to 
understanding our capacity to make 
transformative change. Setting targets 
and monitoring change is essential 
for engaging major investors, 
governments and communities in 
understanding impact. 
This strategy considers the United 
Nation’s sustainable development 
goals. It also aligns to the UN Sendai 
Framework for disaster risk reduction, 
the Paris climate agreement and the 
100 Resilient Cities City Resilience 
Framework. It provides a local 
framework of five directions that any 

organisation or individual can adopt 
and integrate into the planning and 
operation of their lives, their business 
or government policies.
The Resilient Sydney Office will use a 
collaborative impact approach to: 

 o monitor the implementation of all 

actions in the strategy

 o ensure that evaluation is built into 

each action from the beginning
 o produce an annual report of the 

first year after the publication 
of the strategy, reporting upon 
progress in its implementation

 o work with stakeholders to 

determine the best method for 
confirming the baseline, medium 
and long term resilience of Sydney
 o agree with the steering committee 
how we will evaluate the impact of 
the Resilient Sydney Office, to be 
included in the annual report. 

This action will enable evidence based 
decision making, adaptive leadership 
and good governance for resilience in 
Sydney.

ACTION 34

 

Use digital collaboration and 
networking tools
Initiate: Digital tools

Connecting, sharing knowledge and collaborating has 
been difficult in Sydney due to the complexity of our 
governance structures, and the fact that we are not 
always geographically close to people we might need to 
work with. 
This action involves Resilient Sydney with 100 Resilient 
Cities deploying a new online platform to enable 
stakeholders to connect, share information and 
build collaboration no matter where they are located 
in metropolitan Sydney. Participants will include 
stakeholders from government, business, academia, 
community services and the arts and community 
residents. The platform will enable stakeholders 
participating in the actions outlined here to connect.
The first step will be for the Resilient Sydney Office to 
procure a platform to meet our needs. We will test the 
platform with the Resilient Sydney Ambassadors and the 
Cross-City Transport Network.

ACTION 35

 

Learn and share with other cities through the 
100 Resilient Cities network
Amplify: Sharing with other cities

 

Participation in the 100 Resilient Cities global network 
has been key for progressing resilience in metropolitan 
Sydney. The network provides opportunities to share 
information, explore diverse and innovative approaches 
to common problems and make connections with 
counterparts in cities across the world.
As a well-resourced city Sydney has much to contribute 
to the global community of practice within the network. 
There is much to learn from how other cities have 
tackled challenges similar to ours. 
This action involves the Resilient Sydney Steering 
Committee and office  continuing to play an active 
role within the 100 Resilient Cities network, developing 
community, business and government connections with 
other cities, in Australia and internationally. The Office 
will continue to provide a conduit to the network for 
stakeholders across metropolitan Sydney.

Implementing resilience

Improved resilience will occur in Sydney when our 
organisations and communities:

 o understand community risks at both metropolitan and 

local scale

 o know their role in managing and mitigating risks
 o engage in training and capacity building
 o collaborate with others to make decisions, and 
 o invest resources to take action.

This will mean adopting new behaviours and approaches to 
governance and leadership in Sydney. Organisations and 
decision makers are asked to apply the 100 Resilient Cities 
qualities and behaviours to their actions, programs, products, 
investments and policies. This will deliver people-centred and 
city-wide results.

City resilience commitment 
We invite all government, business, academic and community sector organisations in metropolitan Sydney to  
pledge to build their capacity to understand and manage vulnerabilities, interdependencies and risks for everyone  
in metropolitan Sydney. 
By taking this commitment, they  will ensure continuity and safety for their  customers, employees and local 
communities during shock events. They  will demonstrate innovation and market leadership, and improve the  
wellbeing and prosperity of our community. 
We invite you to get involved.
 Commitment means each organisation will:

 o investigate and understand metropolitan scale community risks, as well as the ‘local’ place-based risks 

organisations face

 o engage with the people in the city, most impacted by organisational decisions
 o clarify the role of each  organisation in resilience of the city
 o engage in training and capacity building across each organisation
 o collaborate to develop an action plan for each  organisation
 o undertake action and investment.

Implementing resilience in Sydney 

Monitoring and evaluation

This Resilient Sydney strategy is consistent with the United 
Nation’s sustainable development goals. It also aligns to 
the UN Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction, the 
Paris climate agreement and the 100 Resilient Cities and 
Rockefeller Foundation’s City Resilience Framework. It 
provides a local framework that any organisation or individual 
can adopt and integrate into the planning and operations of 
their lives, their business or government policies.

The Resilient Sydney office will work with people, academics 
and organisations across Sydney and the 100 Resilient Cities 
network to establish a process for measuring and evaluating 
our progress on resilience. 
100 Resilient Cities has published research on the 
behaviours, qualities and principles that support resilience in 
actions, programs, products, investments and policies. 

We commit to: 

 o monitor the implementation of all actions in the strategy
 o ensure that evaluation is built into each action from  

the beginning

 o produce an annual report of the first year after the 

publication of the strategy, reporting upon progress  
in its implementation

 o work with stakeholders to determine the best method  

for confirming the baseline, medium and long term 
resilience of Sydney

 o determine with our Steering Committee how we will 
evaluate the impact of the Resilient Sydney Office,  
and report this.

Resilient Sydney is the result of several years of effort and collaboration across our city.  
The willingness to cooperate is impressive given the work occurred during a time of great 
political and governance change in our city. Resilient Sydney was made possible through the 
generous support of the Rockefeller Foundation and 100 Resilient Cities.  

We especially acknowledge the active contributions from 
the councils of metropolitan Sydney, at every level. Mayors, 
Councillors, General Managers and CEOs continue to show 
leadership and interest in working together. The Resilience 
Ambassadors from each council have carefully guided and 
directed the development of this work, and worked together 
to build new relationships and opportunities for our city.
We thank all those residents of Sydney who made valuable 
contributions and shared their understanding of the city 
during engagement events and surveys. We look forward to 
continuing work with all of you as we implement actions for 
resilience in Sydney. 
Many thanks also to our strategy partner, AECOM, for its 
guidance and support. We also acknowledge the in-kind 
contributions of the City of Sydney, Parramatta City Council 
and the Committee for Sydney. 
We acknowledge the following people and organisations who 
contributed actively to Resilient Sydney, through workshops, 
events, interviews, meetings or the sharing of data and 
knowledge. Their collective contributions have helped shape 
this Resilient Sydney strategy and the work is a reflection of 
their expertise, diversity and generosity.
