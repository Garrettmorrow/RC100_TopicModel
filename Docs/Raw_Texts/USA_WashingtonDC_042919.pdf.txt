LETTER

Muriel Bowser
Mayor

Fellow Washingtonians: 

Washington, DC is one of the strongest, most diverse, and most vibrant cities 
in the United States – our city’s growth and our thriving local economy make 
me the envy of mayors around the globe. For our growth and prosperity to 
continue, we must make sure that we are prepared for the unexpected and 
are resilient in the face of change and challenges. 

Cities across the country increasingly look to Washington, DC – our city, 
not the federal government – for leadership. Through Resilient DC, we have 
the opportunity to work together across disciplines to tackle 21st century challenges and create models for 
other cities to follow. We must vigorously address all of the challenges that we have identified – and those 
that may appear in the future – to ensure that DC not only survives but thrives in the face of change. 

The Resilient DC strategy is the result of a nearly two-year process that developed a deeper understanding 
of some of DC’s most important challenges and vulnerabilities. It brings together and aligns the District’s 
major planning efforts into a coordinated strategy to accelerate action, streamline implementation, and 
embed equity and resilience. 

A robust resilience strategy is not limited to emergency management. It must address all areas where the 
District faces challenges, including affordable housing, economic and social equity, environmental health, 
and urban mobility. These areas all play roles in strengthening our city, reducing risks, mitigating harm, and 
improving our ability to recover when we experience disruptions.  

The District’s strategy must also account for the unique challenges we face as our nation’s capital, from 
potential acts of terrorism to government shutdowns. We recognize the federal government’s outsized 
presence in our city, but we continue to make tremendous strides to grow and promote DC’s private sector 
economy. 

To develop Resilient DC, we took a hard look at both potential sudden shocks – like severe weather, 
flooding, and infrastructure failure – and chronic stresses, such as the high cost of housing, that challenge 
our city on a daily basis. Building a Resilient DC is about addressing both everyday issues – such as poverty 
and inequality – and also the infrequent, unexpected, and potentially catastrophic events that our city could 
face. This comprehensive approach ensures that we are not only stronger and better prepared to overcome 
disruptions, but also to provide benefits to our residents in the absence of disruptions.  

We have a responsibility to think ahead and plan for the future. The Resilient DC strategy outlines goals 
with generational ambition. By examining our challenges and vulnerabilities, we will not only build a more 
resilient DC, but also create new opportunities for residents and ensure that every Washingtonian – 
whether their family has been here for five minutes or five generations – gets a fair shot.  

Sincerely,

 
 

Muriel Bowser, Mayor

RESILIENT DCLETTER

Michael Berkowitz
100RC President

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, congratulations to 
Mayor Bowser and to the District of Columbia on the release of Resilient 
DC, a major milestone for the District and for our partnership. Through 
this ambitious Resilience Strategy, the District is poised to embark on a set 
of initiatives that will help all Washingtonians thrive in the face of change 
— positioning DC as a leader for the nation and for other global cities 
around the world.  

Resilient DC stands out in the 100RC Network as a strategy that is both 
comprehensive in its scope and innovative in its approach. This is a 

forward-thinking roadmap that addresses longstanding and persistent challenges, such as flooding, 
crime, and inequality, while simultaneously preparing the District for emerging and future challenges, 
such as the impacts of technology and growth on DC’s economy and neighborhoods.

For example, we see in the Resilient Rivers Focus Area a bold and integrated approach to 
building resilience at the community level, setting the stage for critical investments that will yield 
environmental, economic, and social benefits for Washingtonians along one of the District’s great 
treasures, the Anacostia River. In addition, the District is advancing a suite of comprehensive 
initiatives to preserve and increase the supply of affordable housing for residents, as well as setting 
forth groundbreaking support to prepare DC’s workforce for the impacts of automation, expanding 
training opportunities while nurturing growth in promising sectors. Finally, this strategy builds upon 
the District’s leadership in climate action, embedding and accelerating mitigation and adaptation 
efforts across District Agencies, partners, and communities. 

This innovative strategy would not be possible without the tireless efforts of Chief Resilience Officer 
Kevin Bush and his team. Kevin led an inclusive engagement effort across DC’s eight wards, District 
Agencies, and multi-sector partners. His vision and leadership, in combination with trailblazing 
commitment from Mayor Bowser, leave the District equipped to confront some of its most intractable 
resilience challenges.

As DC shifts from strategy development to implementation, we are confident that the ambitious 
initiatives outlined in Resilient DC will prepare the District to thrive no matter what shocks and 
stresses it may face — ensuring a more secure and vibrant future for all Washingtonians, while leading 
the way in the global urban resilience movement.

Sincerely,

 
 
Michael Berkowitz, President
100 Resilient Cities

RESILIENCE STRATEGYExecutive summary

Population growth, climate change, and digitization 
combined with inequality and persistent social 
challenges threaten the success of any city. If we 
become more resilient then we can strengthen our 
collective capacity to thrive in the face of change. 
Building our city’s resilience is about addressing 
everyday disasters, like poverty and inequality, so 
that we can bounce back quicker from catastrophic 
events, like floods and infrastructure failure. This 
approach ensures that we’re stronger and better 
prepared for a disaster. It also provides benefits on 
an everyday basis. This strategy provides a roadmap 
for building greater resilience in Washington, DC. It 
is the result of a nearly two-year process of shared 

discovery that resulted in a deeper, cross-sector 
understanding of some of DC’s most important 
challenges. In total, more than 100 community 
leaders and subject matter experts contributed, in 
addition to the 1,100 residents, from all eight wards, 
who shared their ideas for building resilience. 

The Strategy is organized around three main drivers 
of change: economic and population growth; climate 
change; and technological transformation. It also 
includes a chapter focused on individual resilience, 
acknowledging that we can only become a more 
resilient city by addressing longstanding challenges 
related to health and safety.

RESILIENT DCGoal 1, Inclusive Growth, envisions a 
DC where all residents benefit from our 
continued economic and population 
growth, whether they have been here 
for five minutes or five generations. This 
section outlines initiatives that will show 
the world how to leverage growth and 
counter growing inequality.

Goal 3, Smarter DC, envisions a 
DC that embraces advancements in 
technology, while minimizing the negative 
consequences of change. This section 
outlines initiatives that will make DC 
a technology-enabled city with strong 
support and safeguards for its residents.

Goal 2, Climate Action, envisions a 
DC that is prepared for the impacts of 
climate change and where residents and 
businesses take bold action to combat its 
causes. This section outlines initiatives that 
will uphold the commitments of the Paris 
climate agreement and lead the country in 
the response to climate change.

Goal 4, Safe and Healthy Washingtonians, 
envisions a DC where every neighborhood 
is safe, our residents are strong and 
healthy, and all Washingtonians can thrive. 
This section outlines initiatives that build 
individual resilience for all residents 
by addressing disparities in health and 
reducing crime in all neighborhoods.  

In addition, the Strategy places special 
emphasis on the fundamental role of 
equity and governance, and outlines two 
signature, place-based resilience building 
efforts that unite activities described 
across all four goals. 

This is a tactical implementation strategy 
that seeks to bring together and align 
other major planning efforts into one 
coordinated strategy to accelerate action, 
streamline implementation, and embed 
equity and resilience.

Shocks and Stresses
Throughout all four goals in this strategy, we used a 
framework of shocks and stresses to understand DC’s 
vulnerabilities and to prioritize initiatives. 

Shocks are sudden, acute disasters, like storms, floods, heatwaves, or cyberattacks. These 
also include economic crises, like a government shutdown or relocation of a major employer. 
Stresses, on the other hand, are the slow-burning disasters that weaken our city every day, 
and also magnify the impact of shocks. These include the everyday impacts of poverty, 
trauma, and stressed transportation systems. Most of the initiatives in this strategy build 
resilience to numerous shocks and stresses. Some of the priority shocks and stresses 
addressed in Resilient DC include the following:

Government Shutdown
Washington, DC occupies a unique 
position as the seat of the federal 
government, which accounts for roughly a 
third of DC’s workforce and owns a quarter 
of the land within its borders. The 35-day 
federal government shutdown in early 
2019 negatively impacted workers across 
the region and illustrated the importance 
of continuing to diversify the economy. 
This strategy outlines efforts to grow the 
innovation economy, make DC a prime 
location for workers of the future, and 
further buttress DC from the disruptive 
actions of the federal government.   

Strained Transportation Systems
The Washington, DC region is one of the 
most congested in the country. Recently, 
transportation systems have been strained 
by population growth, weather events, 
and aging infrastructure. This stress can 
sometimes result in a shock (Metro’s 
months-long SafeTrack initiative, for 
example, caused disruption throughout the 
region). Improving transportation systems 
will increase our ability to respond to 
and recover from major disasters, while 
addressing everyday issues like traffic 
safety, economic inequality, and lengthy 
commutes. Therefore, this strategy outlines 
initiatives to make getting around DC 
cheaper, faster, and more convenient and 
people-centered. 
 

Shortage of Affordable Housing 
The District’s population, at roughly 
700,000 today, is expected to increase to 
nearly a million people by 2045. The cost 
of housing is projected to increase as the 
gap between housing supply and demand 
widens, and as housing prices continue to 
grow at a faster rate than incomes. A lack of 
housing can exasperate efforts to recover 
from a disaster if residents have nowhere 
to go. This strategy focuses extensively 
on efforts to decrease the housing cost 
burden and limit displacement. Doing so will 
increase our resilience to major disasters 
and help us absorb our population growth 
while preserving affordability for longtime 
residents. 

Flooding 
Formed along the banks of two tidal rivers, 
Washington, DC is a delta city. Sea level 
rise increases our risk of flooding along 
the Potomac and Anacostia rivers. Heavy 
rains, made more frequent and intense by 
climate change, can quickly overwhelm 
our stormwater infrastructure and cause 
inland flooding. With more than 66 inches 
of total annual rainfall, 2018 was a record-
breaking year. Addressing this increased 
risk requires a comprehensive and holistic 
approach that relies on built and nature-
based approaches. This strategy contains 
initiatives that focus on increasing our 
understanding of flood risk and building 
defenses, many of which (like green space) 
deliver multiple benefits.

RESILIENCE STRATEGYWhat is resilience?
Urban resilience is the capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, businesses, and 
systems within a city to survive, adapt, and 
thrive no matter what kinds of chronic stresses 
and acute shocks they experience. 

The systems in a resilient city demonstrate seven qualities, 
described below. 

Integrative
Integrated processes bring together systems and 
institutions and can also catalyze additional benefits as 
resources are shared and actors are enabled to work 
together to achieve greater ends. For example, integrated 
city plans enable a city to deal with multidisciplinary 
issues like climate change, disaster risk reduction, and 
emergency response through coordination. 

Inclusive
Inclusive processes emphasize the need for 
broad consultation to create a sense of shared 
ownership or a joint vision to build  
city resilience. 

Integrated and inclusive relate to the 
processes of good governance and 
effective leadership which ensure that 
investments and actions are appropriate, 
address the needs of the most vulnerable, 
and collectively create a resilient city — for 
everyone. 

Resourcefulness and reflectiveneess are 
about the ability to learn from the past and 
act in times of crisis.

Resourceful

Reflective

Resourceful people and institutions are able to 
recognize alternative ways to use resources in 
times of crisis in order to meet their needs or 
achieve their goals. 

Individuals and institutions that are reflective 
use past experience to inform future decisions 
and will modify standards and behaviors 
accordingly.

8

RESILIENT DCRedundant
Redundancy refers to the spare capacity purposively 
created to accommodate disruption due to extreme 
pressures, surges in demand, or an external event. It 
includes diversity when there are multiple ways to 
achieve a given need. For example, energy systems 
that incorporate redundancy provide multiple 
delivery pathways that can accommodate surges in 
demand or disruption to supply networks. 

Redundancy, robustness, and flexibility 
are qualities that help to conceive systems 
and assets that can withstand shocks and 
stresses as well as the willingness to use 
alternative strategies to facilitate rapid 
recovery. 

Robust

Flexible

Robust design is well-conceived, well-constructed, 
and well-managed and includes making provisions 
to ensure failure is predictable, safe, and not 
disproportionate to the cause. For example, 
protective infrastructure that is robust will not 
fail catastrophically when design thresholds are 
exceeded. 

Flexibility refers to the willingness and ability 
to adopt alternative strategies in response 
to changing circumstances or sudden crises. 
Systems can be made more flexible through 
introducing new technologies or knowledge, 
including recognizing traditional practices.

9

RESILIENCE STRATEGYCity Resilience Framework
Developed by Arup and The Rockefeller 
Foundation, the City Resilience Framework (CRF) 
provides a lens to understand the complexity 
of cities and the drivers that contribute to their 
resilience, with common language that enables 
cities to share knowledge and experiences. 

The CRF is built on four essential dimensions of urban resilience: Health & 
Wellbeing; Economy & Society; Infrastructure & Environment; and Leadership & 
Strategy. Each dimension contains three “drivers,” which reflect the actions cities 
can take to improve their resilience. 

Health & Wellbeing
The systems that ensure everyone living and working 
in the city has access to what they need to survive and 
thrive. 

Economy & Society
The social and financial systems that enable urban 
populations to live peacefully and act collectively. 

Infrastructure & Environment
The man-made and natural systems that provide 
critical services, protect, and connect urban assets 
enabling the flow of goods, services, and knowledge.

Leadership & Strategy
The processes that promote effective leadership, 
inclusive decision-making, empowered stakeholders, 
and integrated planning.

RESILIENCE STRATEGYA Federal District
As the capital of the United States of America, 
Washington, DC stands out among cities.

DC is not just a city. In fact, District Government fulfills the functions of a city, county, and state. Yet, 
it does not have the same rights, authority, or governance structure as states. In recent years, the 
District has proven its ability to govern effectively, earning some of the highest credit ratings among 
U.S. jurisdictions.  The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973, enacted by Congress and approved 
by DC voters, devolved some congressional powers to local government. Also called the Home Rule 
Charter, the Act provides for an elected Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia, but some 
critical authorities are retained by Congress.  

DC Government is led by the Mayor and a 
13-member Council. One councilmember 
is elected from each of DC’s eight wards, 
five councilmembers are elected at-large to 
represent all of DC, and one of the at-large 
members is elected as the chairperson. Under 
Home Rule, DC still lacks senators and voting 
representation in the House of Representatives. 
In addition, Congress has authority to review 
all legislation passed by the Council, and the 
President of the United States appoints its 
judges. The District now has local budget 
authority; however, Congress continues to 
approve budgets for the District’s local funds. 
Congress largely adopts what the District 
passes, but sometimes adds so-called “policy 
riders,” which legislates local issues that are not 
voted on by the people of the District or their 
representatives.

Home Rule specifically prohibits the Council 
from enacting laws that:

•  Lend public credit for private projects;
•  Impose a tax on individuals who work in DC 

but live elsewhere;

•  Make any changes to the Heights of 

Buildings Act of 1910;

•  Pass any law changing the composition or 

jurisdiction of the local courts;

•  Enact a local budget that is not balanced; and
•  Gain any additional authority over the 
National Capital Planning Commission, 
Washington Aqueduct, or District of 
Columbia National Guard.1

Recent intrusions into local affairs and lack of full democracy motivated the District’s seventh Mayor, 
Muriel Bowser, to champion statehood for DC. In November 2016, 86% of DC voters supported a 
statehood referendum and an Admissions Act is pending in Congress.2

RESILIENCE STRATEGYTimeline of recent major shocks

2001
9/11 
The terror attacks of September 11, 2001 
exposed the District’s vulnerability to a 
variety of shocks and stresses.
Radio and cellular communication within 
public safety agencies failed due to 
increased use, according to then-police 
Chief Charles Ramsey, and many city 
residents reported that their cell service 
failed. The attack led to a 3% decrease in 
tourism in 2002, according to the National 
Tour Association. The city’s hotel occupan-
cy rate fell to a decade-low of 66.7% and 
remained depressed through 2003.

2003
HURRICANE ISABEL
On September 18, Hurricane Isabel made 
landfall on the Outer Banks of North 
Carolina. 
The storm weakened over land. During that 
time, Washington, DC experienced sustained 
winds below tropical storm force.  Even still, 
the storm caused widespread damage in the 
District, downing 1,600 trees and leaving 
129,000 customers temporarily without power. 
Storm surge also resulted in ﬂooding in the 
Washington Navy Yard. In total, the storm 
caused $125 million in damages in 2003 dollars. 

2011
EARTHQUAKE
On August 23, 2011 at 1:51 p.m., an 
earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 
occurred along the Central Virginal Seismic 
Zone 5 miles from Mineral, Virginia and 84 
miles southwest of the city.5
The shaking from this earthquake was felt as 
far away as New England. While the 
earthquake did not cause widespread 
damage in the city, it did highlight the 
vulnerabilities of certain types of building 
structures: a few buildings sustained minor 
damage and both the Washington Monument 
and the National Cathedral sustained major 
damage as a result of the earthquake.

14

2012
DERECHO
On June 29, 2012 — one of DC’s hottest days 
on record, with a high of 104°F — the DC 
area experienced one of the most 
destructive thunderstorms in its history. 
On the day before and morning of the 
derecho, the National Weather Service Storm 
Prediction Center was forecasting low 
probability of any type of severe storm. 
However, late in the afternoon and evening, 
with little to no warning, wind gusts of 60-80 
mph ripped through the DC area. Thirteen 
people were killed, hundreds of trees were 
downed, and approximately 68,000 
customers were without power in Washington, 
DC. Furthermore, DC Water urged residents 
to conserve water as pumps were oﬄine and 
not able to reﬁll reservoirs. Seventeen Metro 
stations experienced isolated power outages 
and third-rail electricity was knocked out on 
the Red Line. It took weeks to rebuild the 
power grid in many locations.6

2013
NAVY YARD SHOOTING
On the morning of Monday, September 16, 
2013, a gunman entered Washington Navy 
Yard Building 197 and carried out the 
deadliest workplace mass shooting in the 
nation’s capital. 
Over the course of 69 minutes, the gunman 
terrorized thousands of employees, killing 12 
people and wounding 14 others, including a 
police oﬃcer. Within minutes of the ﬁrst 
reports of gunshots, hundreds of police and 
naval oﬃcers surrounded the Naval Sea 
Systems Command headquarters. However, 
communication problems among federal and 
local authorities complicated the search for 
the gunman.7 

2006
FEDERAL TRIANGLE FLOODING 
In 2006, DC experienced a 200-year storm 
event, which dropped more than six inches 
of rain in six hours. 
As the lowest point in the city, the Federal 
Triangle area experienced the greatest 
ﬂooding. The existing stormwater drainage 
infrastructure (a combined sewer system) 
could not handle the large volume of rainfall 
over such a short period and it overﬂowed. 
The storm caused up to three feet of ﬂooding 
in city streets in the Federal Triangle area and 
ﬂooded the 9th and 12th Street tunnels under 
the National Mall as well as two underground 
Metro stations. The ﬂooding also caused 
extensive property damage, power loss, 
transportation delays, and infrastructure and 
equipment damage, costing tens of millions of 
dollars to repair and forcing government 
facilities to close for several days.3

2016
SAFETRACK
SafeTrack was an accelerated track work 
plan to address safety recommendations and 
rehabilitate the Metrorail system to improve 
safety and reliability. 
At the time, Metrorail operated 135 out of 168 
hours per week, which left insuﬃcient time for 
maintenance and other track work. Through 
the plan, Metrorail combined three years of 
track work into one year through 16 SafeTrack 
surges that closed or reduced capacity across 
the Metrorail system. These closures created 
widespread disruption to individuals that live 
and work in DC. Rail trips fell 12 percent from 
June through December, compared to the 
same period the year before. Rail trips have 
continued to fall even through SafeTrack was 
completed. 

RESILIENT DC2009
METRO TRAIN COLLISION 
On Monday, June 22, 2009, Washington 
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority 
(WMATA) Metrorail train 112 crashed into 
stationary Metrorail train 214. 
The accident occurred during evening rush 
hour on the aboveground track on the 
Metrorail Red Line near the Fort Totten 
station in Washington, DC after the automatic 
train control system failed. It was later 
discovered that a malfunctioning electronic 
circuit led to the crash. The accident killed 
nine people, including the train operator, and 
injured 70 others in the deadliest accident in 
Metrorail’s 33-year history. Emergency 
response agencies reported transporting 52 
people to local hospitals.4

2010
SNOWMAGEDDON
During the winter of 2009–2010, DC was 
paralyzed by four of the area’s largest snow 
events in 144 years on record:

December 20, 2009: 
16.4 to 20 inches of 
snow fell within the 
District’s boundaries.

February 5–6, 2010: 
18 to 32 inches of snow, 
ranking among the top 
ﬁve largest snow 
events in 144 years on 
record.

February 9–10, 2010: 
Three straight hours of 
wind gusts of more 
than 35 mph, visibility 
of a quarter-mile or 
less, and blowing snow.

February 25–27, 2010: 
The city’s fourth-largest 
snowstorm, with 17.8 
inches of snow 
measured at Reagan 
National Airport.

The combined storms knocked out power to 
more than 140,000 Pepco customers, caused 
the cancelation of almost 10,000 ﬂights in and 
out of the region and the closure of schools 
and government oﬃces, and limited many 
streets to pedestrian pathways. As a result, 
the storms had signiﬁcant impacts on the 
local economy. 

The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan 
Washington highlighted six Washington-area 
restaurants as an example, noting that the 
February 2010 blizzards cost them about 
$400,000 — with restaurant workers losing a 
combined $60,000 in hourly wages. 

Due to unsafe conditions for repair crews, 
some residents were left without power for 
over ﬁve days. The U.S. Oﬃce of Personnel 
Management said each snow day resulted in 
the loss of $100 million of worth of work by 
government employees. The District 
Government estimates the average cost of a 
fully-deployed snow removal operation at 
over $110,000 per shift.

2017
HEALTH CARE ACCESS EAST OF 
THE RIVER
In August 2017, District regulators shut down 
the maternity ward at United Medical Center 
— the only obstetrics facility in Southeast 
Washington — after serious care concerns, 
declining admissions, and ﬁnancial troubles. 
The city had taken over management of the 
hospital in 2010, following the third bankruptcy 
ﬁling since its opening in 1966. For residents, 
the closure meant decreased access to nearby 
care and led to some confusion over which 
other hospitals would accept diﬀerent levels 
and types of insurance coverage.  It also 
highlighted the complicated landscape of 
health care in DC — even when UMC’s 
maternity ward was open, most women in 
Southeast DC traveled across the District to 
hospitals in Northwest and Northeast to give 
birth. However, UMC was reportedly the only 
hospital providing prenatal care to “walk-ins” 
and was a site where women could give birth 
in emergencies. District oﬃcials are working on 
a plan to build a new hospital in Southeast DC 
to replace UMC.

2019
UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
SHUTDOWN (2013, 2018, 2018–2019)
The United States federal government has 
experienced three signiﬁcant partial 
shutdowns in the past decade. 
During a shutdown, “non-essential” federal 
employees are furloughed, while employees 
deemed to be “essential” work without pay. 
Federal wages and salaries alone account for 
7.5% of the region’s economy and although many 
federal employees receive back pay, many 
lower-wage contract employees do not. The 
District Government is able to remain open 
using reserve funds already approved by 
Congress and often assumes the expenses of 
some federal responsibilities within the city. 
However, many federal resources are 
unavailable during a shutdown such as museum 
access and payments from Medicaid and other 
social beneﬁt programs.8

October 2013: 
800,000 furloughed employees for 16 days9

January 2018: 
692,000 furloughed employees for three days10

December 2018 to January 2019: 
+/- 800,000 furloughed employees for 35 days11

RESILIENCE STRATEGYLearning from past work

Resilient DC is a tactical implementation strategy focused on activities that will make 
DC thrive in the face of change. This strategy seeks to bring together and align other 
major planning efforts into one coordinated strategy to accelerate action, streamline 
implementation, and embed equity and resilience. Here are some of the ways that the 
Focus Areas and Goals in Resilient DC align with other District planning efforts.

1  Safer, Stronger DC  outlines a comprehensive 
public safety agenda that will bring stability, 
opportunity, and more services to the 
neighborhoods that have been hardest hit by 
crime. It outlines a community-based, public health 
approach to violence prevention that emphasizes 
the holistic needs of individuals and their 
community.

2  LIVE. LONG. DC. is the District’s strategic 
plan to reduce opioid use and misuse and to 
reduce opioid-related deaths by 50 percent by 
2020. It was created by a public–private working 
group of more than 40 stakeholders, and outlines 
strategies to address the opioid epidemic through 
prevention, treatment, and recovery support.

3  Workforce Investment Opportunity Act 
Unified State Plan12 seeks to create a workforce 
ecosystem that is coordinated, easily accessible, 
customer-focused, and efficient. The plan outlines 
activities designed to ensure that every DC 
resident is ready, able, and empowered to discover 
and attain their fullest potential through lifelong 
learning, sustained employment, and economic 
security. This plan is required to receive federal 
funding for workforce development.

4  Healthy People 202013 sets goals, population-
level health outcome objectives, and targets for 
the year 2020. It also recommends evidence-based 
strategies to improve key health outcomes for 
District of Columbia residents.

5  Cultural Plan seeks to strengthen arts, 
humanities, culture, and heritage in neighborhoods 
across the city by increasing cultural participation, 
supporting artists and talent development, 
stimulating cultural production, and informing 
decision-making.

6  DC’s Economic Strategy14  seeks to ensure DC 
becomes the global model for inclusive prosperity 
and resilience, showcasing how diversity and 
innovation can drive equitable economic growth. It 
provides an update to the last economic strategy, 
which was released in 2012.

7  Housing Preservation Strike Force Report15 
summarizes the conclusions of the Mayor’s Housing 
Preservation Strike Force. These conclusions lay 
out an action plan to preserve the District’s existing 
affordable housing strategy, with a special emphasis 
on covenants that are set to expire in 2020.  

8  Consolidated Plan16 provides an analysis 
of government policies, functions, and data 
to determine housing market conditions and 
affordable housing and community development 
needs. This five-year plan is required to receive 
funding from the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development through the Community 
Development Block Grant, HOME Investment 
Partnerships, Emergency Solutions Grant, Housing 
Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, and National 
Housing Trust Fund programs.

9  Climate Ready DC summarizes the expected 
impact of climate change on built infrastructure 
and community resources. It also outlines 77 
adaptation strategies, designed to prepare the 
District for the impacts of climate change. 

10  Clean Energy DC identifies 55 actions to reduce the 
city’s greenhouse gas emissions by 50% of 2006 levels 
by 2032, and 80% of 2006 levels by 2032.

11  Sustainable DC outlines actions to make 
DC the healthiest, greenest, most livable city 
in the country. The Department of Energy and 
Environment released this plan in 2013 and is 
currently updating it.

RESILIENCE STRATEGY18

RESILIENT DC100 Resilient Cities

100 Resilient Cities (100RC) — pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation — is a global network that helps cities around 
the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and 
economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 

In 2016, under the leadership 
of Mayor Muriel Bowser, 
Washington, DC was selected 
from more than 1,000 cities 
around the world to become 
part of the 100RC network. 

Through its participation, DC is committed to 
demonstrating leadership in urban resilience and 
ensuring that everyone thrives in the face of change. 

DC and 100RC view resilience as not just the 
shocks — floods, terrorist attacks, and other acute 
events — but also the stresses that weaken the 
fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis, 
such as economic hardship or social inequality. By 
addressing both the shocks and the stresses in a 
holistic manner, DC will be better able to respond 
to adverse events and deliver basic functions in 
both good times and bad. 

The 100RC program supports resilience building at the city level 
along four pathways. 

•  Financial support for the creation of a new 

•  Access to solutions, tools, and specialized 

position in the government that will lead the 
effort, the Chief Resilience Officer. 

•  Technical and logistical support for the 

development of a Resilience Strategy that 
will serve as DC’s roadmap toward greater 
resilience. 

partnerships from the private, public, 
academic, and nonprofit sectors to help 
implement Resilient DC. 

•  Inclusion into a network of other cities to 
advance the practice of resilience globally 
through best practices, innovation, and 
peer-to-peer learning.

21

RESILIENCE STRATEGYHow this strategy was developed

This strategy is intended to be a holistic, action-oriented 
roadmap to accelerate work that builds DC’s resilience to 
change. It is the product of a multi-year process of mutual 
discovery and dialog that involved stakeholders from multiple 
silos of government and sectors of society. The entire process is 
outlined below.

1
Forming a 
partnership

2
Launching  
Resilient DC

3
Setting a  
baseline 

On February 9, 2017, Mayor Muriel 
Bowser joined 100 Resilient Cities 
and community leaders to launch 
DC’s resilience effort at an agenda-
setting workshop. The workshop 
brought a diverse set of stakeholders 
from across DC government, the 
private sector, nonprofits, academia, 
and civic groups into the planning 
process. The goal of the workshop 
was to discuss and prioritize 
threats the city is facing, along with 
resilience-building tools and plans 
to address those threats. This began 
the process of identifying priorities, 
actions, and metrics for the city’s 
resilience effort. Participants also 
discussed their priorities for a Chief 
Resilience Officer (CRO) in order 
to inform the search for candidates. 
Following this event, the Mayor 
formed a Resilience Cabinet, made 
up of 17 agency directors and deputy 
mayors, to help guide the effort.

After an exhaustive search, Mayor 
Muriel Bowser appointed Kevin Bush 
as DC’s first Chief Resilience Officer 
on July 21, 2017. Appointing a CRO 
is an essential element of the 100 
Resilient Cities partnership. CROs 
from cities around the world regularly 
share best practices and surface 
innovative thinking through the 100 
Resilient Cities Network. The CRO 
position is specifically designed to 
break down existing barriers, account 
for pre-existing work, and create 
partnerships that build resilience, 
with a particular focus on low-income 
and vulnerable populations. 100 
Resilient Cities provided funding for 
this position through its partnership 
with DC. With the appointment 
of a CRO, DC began to build the 
foundation for its Resilience Strategy.

In late 2017, the DC Government began 
diagnostic and analytical work to assess 
DC’s existing resilience and identify 
focus areas for further research and 
engagement. In total, Resilient DC 
consulted more than 500 individuals 
from government, business, nonprofit, 
and institutional sectors; interviewed 
dozens of staff members and directors 
from more than 15 agencies; cataloged 
more than 400 activities that already 
contribute to DC’s resilience; reviewed 
the 25 most recent citywide plans; 
and gained a better understanding 
of DC’s exposure and vulnerability to 
shocks and stresses. The Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment, completed 
in March 2018, summarizes that work 
and provides a high-level assessment 
of DC’s threats, strengths and 
weaknesses, capacities, and challenges 
and opportunities for building greater 
resilience. It concluded by outlining 
key areas for further research and 
engagement. These included a focus on 
governance, climate action, economic 
mobility, technological change, 
equity, and the Anacostia River. The 
assessment was reviewed by the City 
Administrator, the Mayor’s Resilience 
Cabinet, and the Commission on 
Climate Change and Resiliency.

22

RESILIENT DCResilient DC also recognized that there has been a tremendous amount of engagement 
with residents over the last few years. In fact, since 2015, DC has produced more than 25 
citywide strategic and policy plans. As a result, staff also analyzed the nearly 1,000 ideas 
identified in those plans to make sure that we are building upon prior engagement efforts.  

Resilient DC assessed these ideas, both new and old, based on which would have the 
greatest impact in addressing DC’s shocks and stresses. The 68 initiatives in this strategy 
reflect the final review of the Mayor’s Resilience Cabinet. 

4

Research and 
discovery

On May 21, 2018, DC convened 
more than 100 representatives from 
multiple areas of government and 
sectors of society to begin a process 
of research and discovery. At this 
meeting, DC formed five multi-sector 
working groups to better understand 
DC’s critical issues and identify 
ways to increase urban resilience. 
During the summer, these groups 
volunteered their time and expertise 
to conduct analysis, gather best 
practices, and learn together. DC 
brought these groups together in 
September to present their findings 
and brainstorm ideas. This model of 
intensive community engagement 
allowed DC Government officials 
and stakeholders to learn about and 
explore cross-sector challenges and 
solutions side-by-side over the course 
of several months. 

In late October, the Mayor’s 
Resilience Cabinet and Commission 
on Climate Change and Resiliency 
held a joint meeting to review what 
the working groups had learned. 
This meeting, the Vision-Setting 
Workshop, was used to develop 
a vision, goals, and objectives for 
Resilient DC. That structure now 
serves as the outline for this strategy.

5

Collaborative idea 
generation and 
refinement

In November 2018, DC Government 
launched an online platform  
(http://www.neighborland.com) to 
gather ideas and solicit feedback 
from a variety of stakeholders across 
the city. More than 1,100 residents 
participated in this process. Through 
this platform, residents were able to 
refine and vote on which initiatives 
respond to DC’s shocks and stresses. 
The online platform was organized 
around the vision, goals, and 
objectives established by the Cabinet 
and Commission. 

In tandem with this platform, in 
late 2018, the District held open 
houses in all eight wards as well as 
14 workshops with key stakeholder 
groups. These more traditional public 
engagement forums were structured 
to align with the online platform, and 
the ideas generated during the in-
person meetings were subsequently 
added to the Neighborland site. This 
allowed Resilient DC to maximize 
outreach and feedback from DC 
residents through a variety of 
platforms.

RESILIENCE STRATEGYSupport from 100 Resilient 
Cities Platform Partners

As a member of 100 Resilient Cities, Washington, DC received 
pro bono tools and services from several private sector and 
nonprofit partners to help address priority shocks and stresses 
and support the development of Resilient DC.

Deltares provided technical analysis and advisory 
support that accelerated plans to create an integrated 
urban flood model that combines riverine, coastal, and 
rainfall flooding, as described in Initiative 2.2.1. This 
modeling will allow the District to understand flooding 
vulnerabilities more effectively and prioritize climate 
adaptation investments.

Neighborland partnered with the District to create 
an online portal for stakeholders and residents to 
provide feedback throughout the development of 
initiatives in Resilient DC, including at in-person 
workshops and open houses. 

frog design held a workshop with District Agencies 
to generate new ideas for creative community 
engagement. The workshop helped inspire efforts to 
build a more inclusive and responsive government in 
the Equity in Governance Focus Area.

Perkins Eastman led a design workshop with cross-
sector stakeholders that explored design approaches 
to yield multiple benefits including mitigating flood risk, 
enhancing base security, connecting residents to the 
river, habitat restoration, and other resilience benefits 
at Fort McNair. The ideas generated at this workshop 
contributed to the Resilient Rivers Focus Area.

RESILIENCE STRATEGYImplementation 

The goals, objectives, initiatives, and focus areas of this strategy are 
informed by past efforts, analysis of current conditions, and input 
from stakeholders across the city. Successful implementation of 
this strategy must be shared by government agencies, businesses, 
nonprofit organizations, and residents as building resilience requires 
sustained, coordinated action from inside and outside of government. 

Each initiative and focus area outlines successive actions, involving 
multiple actors, to address a specific resilience challenge. Many 
initiatives incorporate prior efforts and ideas, seeking to accelerate 
action and increase impact. Implementation of this strategy will 
require sustained, executive-level focus to coordinate partners and 
secure resources. 

1

The Office of the City 
Administrator (OCA) will 
manage the implementation 
of this strategy. The Chief 
Resilience Officer will serve as a 
project manager and work with 
District agencies and external 
partners to overcome barriers to 
implementation, connect people 
and resources, track progress, and 
mitigate risks.  

2

This team will provide regular 
reports to the City Administrator, 
the Mayor’s Resilience Cabinet, 
and the Commission on Climate 
Change and Resiliency for 
oversight and tracking. In addition, 
the CRO will work with the Office 
of Budget and Performance 
Management to ensure that 
agencies’ annual performance 
plans reflect their contribution 
to this work. OCA will also hold 
a cross-agency budget review 
to align resources and ensure 
implementation.

3

This implementation-focused 
structure will bridge the gap 
that often exists in government 
between planning and action. 
Delivery units are increasingly 
used by governments to provide 
sustained, executive-level focus 
on key promises made. This small 
team, within the Office of the 
City Administrator, will increase 
DC’s capacity to delivery on key 
policy goals.

RESILIENT DCResilient Rivers

With the release of this strategy, we are launching a Resilient 
Rivers program to rethink the relationship between DC’s 
waterways and the communities that thrive along them. This 
program will result in infrastructure designs that achieve multiple 
community-informed objectives.

RECENT PROGRESS
DC’s rivers are cleaner, more accessible, and 
healthier than they have been in decades. The 
progress being made along the Anacostia River 
stands out as an international example of river 
restoration and riverfront regeneration. This 
progress has fueled the development of several 
new riverfront neighborhoods, including the Capitol 
Riverfront and the Wharf, and will continue to 
increase the residents, visitors, and businesses that 
come to the Anacostia and Potomac rivers to live, 
work, and play. 

As we continue to rediscover DC’s 47 miles of 
coastline, we must also address the increased risk 
of flooding caused by climate change, erosion, 
and land subsidence. The average high tide of the 
Potomac and Anacostia rivers has increased by 
11 inches over the past 90 years. The U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers predicts another 40.8 inches 
of sea level rise by 2080. In addition, the National 
Climate Assessment predicts that the frequency 
and intensity of tropical storms will increase in the 
Mid-Atlantic. These two factors increase the risk of 
flooding in DC’s riverfront communities. 

Recognizing these challenges, we convened experts 
and community groups for an intense, months-long 
period of research, discovery, and opportunity 
assessment. These individuals volunteered their 
time and expertise to gather best practices on urban 
waterfront development and anti-displacement 
strategies, inventory public access points along the 
river, and more. In addition, on May 30, 2018, the 
Anacostia Waterfront Trust, Resilient DC, the Urban 
Waters Federal Partnership, and Congresswoman 
Eleanor Holmes Norton hosted “Equity, Resilience, 
and the Anacostia River Corridor: Conference 
and Ideas Forum.” Residents, businesses, and 
other stakeholders came together to discuss best 
practices in urban parks and strategies for limiting 

displacement. Speakers included representatives 
from Atlanta and San Francisco, who spoke about 
their work building urban resilience. The timing of 
these efforts coincided with the 100-year anniversary 
of Anacostia National Park, the 15-year anniversary 
of the landmark Anacostia Waterfront Framework, 
and other milestones. Many of the stakeholders 
involved in this effort also participated in a campaign 
to celebrate the river through the Year of the 
Anacostia. Their ideas informed this initiative and are 
infused throughout the Resilience Strategy. 

MOVING FORWARD
Building on this momentum, we will work together 
as government, philanthropy, and the community 
to make the goals and objectives of this Resilience 
Strategy manifest along the Anacostia River. 
Specifically, we will:

•  Use inclusive engagement to inform the 

design of capital investments that do double 
duty — addressing the impact of climate 
change while providing increased community 
services, particularly for vulnerable riverfront 
communities. 

•  Proactively invest in anti-displacement 

strategies, recognizing the economic pressures 
that often accompany increased investment. 

Through this process, we will design implementable 
resilient infrastructure investments, in multiple 
sites, that have strong community support. 
These measures will move beyond traditional 
infrastructure investments (e.g. levees) and toward 
layered, distributed, and systemic measures that 
work together toward greater resilience. Special 
attention will be paid to how parks, roads, and 
sidewalks can work together, as a system, to protect 
against flooding and to cool neighborhoods on hot 
summer days.

RESILIENT DCPilot Locations

This place-based effort will begin in two areas: Southwest DC 
and the Kenilworth Park area (i.e. Mayfair, Kenilworth, Eastland 
Gardens, and Parkside neighborhoods). Both were identified as 
Priority Planning Areas in Climate Ready DC, recognizing the 
areas’ increased vulnerability to climate change. Taken together, 
these two areas will showcase how an interdisciplinary approach 
can achieve multiple benefits for the community, with an 
emphasis on two of DC’s greatest resilience challenges: climate 
and growth. 

SOUTHWEST DC
Large areas of Southwest DC are at risk from 
several types of flooding. In this area, we will create 
a strategy to design, prioritize, and construct 
capital improvements on parklands (e.g. Randall, 
Lansburgh, 3rd and I Street Park, and King 
Greenleaf) and transportation right-of-way to 
manage stormwater and mitigate flood risk. This 
strategy will also identify and adopt Special Design 
Guidelines for Southwest DC, such as parks that 
capture and treat large amounts of stormwater. 
This is similar to best practices seen in Denmark, 
the Netherlands, Argentina, and New Orleans. 

KENILWORTH PARK
The neighborhoods surrounding Kenilworth Park 
are some of the most at risk to flooding in DC. 
In addition, these neighborhoods are currently 
experiencing significant disparities across a variety 
of indicators of opportunity when compared to the 
District as a whole. Many plans and initiatives have 
recently been developed for the area, from climate 
equity to planned investments. Furthermore, the 
Kenilworth North area, which is currently owned by 
the National Park Service, is expected to transition 
to District of Columbia control in the future. 
Therefore, we will seize this opportunity to lead a 
community-centered process that aligns ongoing 
and planned investments to achieve community 
objectives and lower flood risk. 

37

RESILIENCE STRATEGYEquity in Governance

Equity is fundamental to resilience. Acute shocks, such as 
hurricanes and building fires, often expose long-simmering 
inequalities that are caused by chronic stresses. Furthermore, 
these stresses, left unaddressed, can be as damaging as acute 
shocks. Inclusive cities adopt policies that promote greater equity 
and help correct historical wrongs that have resulted in inequality 
of opportunity. 

Inequality has its roots in institutional and systemic biases that 
intentionally and unintentionally excluded certain people based 
on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, or other 
aspect of identity. For example, past policies like redlining, 
which allowed mortgage lenders to discriminate against Black 
people, and the placement of sources of pollution near minority 
neighborhoods continues to be a source of injustice for people of 
color. In fact, a recent national study found that three out of four 
previously redlined communities continue to struggle, 80 years 
after they were redlined.17

Historically, government has been a powerful actor among 
societal systems that have disenfranchised entire classes of 
people based on their race or other aspect of identity. As 
government has been part of the problem, it must be part of the 
solution. Inclusive governments establish policies and programs 
that correct past injustice and empower their residents to 
participate, prosper, and reach their full potential.  

38

RESILIENT DCRECENT PROGRESS
DC has long been committed to confronting and 
correcting the legacy of institutional bias. Recently, 
under the leadership of Mayor Muriel Bowser, the 
District has made historic investments in education 
and childcare, with a focus on creating “pathways 
to the middle class” for all residents. For example, 
the administration has:

MOVING FORWARD
We recognize that decades of structural and 
institutional racial bias has created persistent racial 
inequalities across a wide range of indicators of 
opportunity. Race should no longer be an accurate 
predictor of wealth, achievement, or health in 
Washington, DC. To achieve this, we will accelerate 
and make explicit efforts to eliminate racial 
disparities. Specifically, we will:

•  Made a $12.5 million investment in affordable, 

high-quality childcare.

•  Increased funding for DC’s traditional and 

charter public schools in school year 2018–19 
by $94 million.

•  Opened the DC Infrastructure Academy 

in Ward 8 to create a pipeline for residents 
to high-demand infrastructure jobs, with an 
average hourly wage of $48.75. 

•  Released A Fair Shot Toolkit for African 

American Prosperity, which includes 
information on DC Government-funded 
programs that can help individuals, families, 
and business owners find their pathway to 
economic prosperity.

•  Identify an appropriate partner to launch a 

series of community dialogues with community 
organizations and academic institutions, 
to discuss the lasting effects of historic 
structural racism, facilitate opportunities 
for conversation, learning, and healing, and 
surface new ideas for addressing disparities 
and building social cohesion.

•  Train District Government employees to 

recognize and address bias, expanding the 
existing Metropolitan Police Department 
(MPD) program to other agencies. This 
ongoing training will focus on untangling 
racism and institutional racism, culture, equity 
and equality, and intentional and unintentional 
bias in the context of policy, programming, and 
engagement.

•  Develop indicators measuring racial disparities 
across key areas and leverage these indicators 
to track progress annually toward advancing 
more equitable outcomes.

•  Formally charter the existing Equity Officers 

Community of Practice to share best practices 
and coordinate activities across District 
Government.

39

RESILIENCE STRATEGYKey terms

Equity is just and fair inclusion into a society 
in which all can participate, prosper, and 
reach their full potential.

Equality is a state in which everyone gets 
the same opportunities and experiences 
outcomes not dependent on race, sex, sexual 
orientation, or other aspects of identity.

Inclusion is the action or state of including or 
of being included within a group or structure.
More than simply diversity and numerical 
representation, inclusion involves authentic 
and empowered participation and a true 
sense of belonging.

Structural racism (or structural racialization)  
is racial bias across institutions and society. It 
describes the cumulative and compounding 
effects of an array of factors that systematically 
privilege White people and disadvantage 
people of color. Since the word “racism” 
often is understood as a conscious belief, 
“racialization” may be a better way to describe 

a process that does not require intentionality. 
Race equity expert John A. Powell writes: 
“ ‘Racialization’ connotes a process rather 
than a static event. It underscores the fluid 
and dynamic nature of race… ‘Structural 
racialization’ is a set of processes that may 
generate disparities or depress life outcomes 
without any racist actors.” 

Institutional racism is racial inequity within 
institutions and systems of power, such as 
places of employment, government agencies, 
and social services. It can take the form of 
unfair policies and practices, discriminatory 
treatment, and inequitable opportunities and 
outcomes. A school system that concentrates 
people of color in the most overcrowded 
and under-resourced schools with the 
least qualified teachers compared to the 
educational opportunities of White students 
is an example of institutional racism.

We will also build a more inclusive and responsive government 
that establishes a robust feedback loop between engagement 
and decision-making to deliver more equitable outcomes for all 
DC residents. Through this effort, we will:

•  Centralize initiation, review, approval, and oversight of strategic and policy plans within the Executive 

Office of the Mayor.

•  Create a consolidated application for all individual benefits and programs.
•  Outline a shared framework and approval process for strategic and policy plans that focus on 

interagency alignment and resource allocation (e.g. budget and performance).

•  Seek to align employee performance plans with agency performance plans.
•  Create a public engagement community of practice and professionalize engagement across DC 

Government via guidance, training, and standard operating procedures.

RESILIENT DCGoals

41

RESILIENCE STRATEGYGoal 1: Inclusive Growth 

We envision a DC where all residents benefit from our 
continued economic and population growth, whether they 
have been here for five minutes or five generations. With 
the initiatives outlined below, DC will show the world 
how to counter growing inequality and address historical 
inequities. 

During the past several years, DC has experienced robust 
economic growth; however, this growth has not benefited 
residents equally. Existing inequalities, much of it due to 
the country’s legacy of structural racism, are pronounced 
along racial and geographic lines. At the same time, DC’s 
population is growing and its demographics are changing. 
Many neighborhoods are experiencing dramatic changes 
in population size, household income, educational 
attainment, and racial makeup.

What we know

The city’s population will grow to 987,000 
by 2045 (an increase of 29.6% from 2015)18 
and the region’s population will grow to 
6,876,000 by 2045 (an increase of 28.0% 
from 2015).

 

The region will face a shortfall of 690,000 
housing units by 2045, a 20% increase 
from the 575,000 currently needed to 
close the housing gap.19

Our Vision

To grow average household net worth and eliminate disparities by race

Existing net worth inequality, much of it due to the country’s legacy of structural racism, has widened and is 
pronounced along racial and geographic lines. In 2013 and 2014, Black households had an average net worth 
of $3,500 while White households had an average net worth of $284,000.20 This contrast is attributed 
mainly to lower home values, higher rates of unemployment, lower median incomes, and a long history of 
barriers to wealth building. 

Wealth creation including both income generation and asset building — while breaking the social structures 
that created the disparities — will be important ways that residents grow their net worth.

To shrink income inequality 

Today, the average household income of the top 5% 
of income earners is 520% higher than the bottom 
20%, placing DC’s income gap among the top five 
among the largest U.S. cities.21 Income inequality 
rankings list DC as having the second highest income 
inequality among the 100 most populous U.S. cities 
from 2014 to 2016.22 Creating pathways to the middle 
class, investing in education, and supporting the 
underrepresented will contribute to closing the 
income inequality gap.

To decrease housing cost burden 

DC’s population is growing and its demographics 
are changing. Many neighborhoods are experiencing 
dramatic changes in population size, household 
income, educational attainment, and racial makeup. In 
addition, rents are growing faster than incomes: from 
2002 to 2013, the middle 20% of incomes increased 
on average 9% compared to an average 44% increase 
for rent.23 For the bottom 20% of incomes, incomes 
have grown 0% while rent has increased 14%.24 This 
gap makes it unsustainable for many residents to 
continue living in their homes.

A survey conducted by DC Government revealed 
that Black residents are about three times as likely 
to be at risk of becoming residentially unstable.25 
Residential instability (past and future moves due 
to costs, better conditions, more space, or missed 
payments) is associated with poorer educational 
and health outcomes, lower community 
cohesiveness, and poverty. 

Building strong and affordable neighborhoods to 
accommodate growth and resist displacement 
will contribute to reducing residents’ housing cost 
burden.

To equip DC youth with 
the skills and qualifications 
required for high-paying jobs

DC experiences a striking difference in educational 
attainment, which in turn is reflected in job 
opportunities. In 2015, White adults were four 
times more likely than Black adults to hold a 
bachelor’s degree or higher.26 That same year, 60% 
of jobs required a bachelor’s degree or higher, 
while 40% of DC adults did not qualify for these 
jobs.27 Investing in education and increasing access 
to opportunities will respond to the need to align 
educational attainment with jobs.

To improve the small business 
climate 

DC, like many major U.S. cities, has a high cost 
of doing business. Office rent and labor costs 
are the main driving forces behind this cost in 
DC. Compared to the surrounding area, DC has 
a higher cost of doing business due primarily 
to labor, energy, and tax costs.28 Tax costs, in 
particular, are much higher than the surrounding 
area. However, compared to peer cities (New 
York City, Boston, San Francisco), DC has lower 
costs of doing business.29 Despite high business 
costs and a complex regulatory environment, DC 
is considered small-business friendly relative to 
peer cities. While DC is home to significant growth 
companies and a strong growth equity ecosystem, 
it lags in startup density and availability of capital 
for startups. Stimulating a diverse and innovative 
economy while protecting underrepresented 
business owners will contribute to supporting small 
businesses.

Economic mobility is the ability of an individual or 
family to change their economic status (moving from 
poverty to the middle class, for example). Research has 
shown that one’s ability to climb the economic ladder 
is dependent on many factors beyond traditional 
workforce development programs. Each year, the 
District Government invests millions of dollars in 
programs to provide pathways up the economic 
ladder, yet too many residents still experience poverty. 
Recognizing this, in 2015, Mayor Muriel Bowser 
outlined goals for creating pathways to the middle 
class for residents in all eight wards. These included 
investments in education, public safety, economic 
opportunities, and more. Going forward, we will create 
an economic mobility lab to accelerate these efforts by 
investing in evidence-based approaches that reduce 
poverty and increase economic mobility. By learning 
from research, gathering new evidence, and investing 
in what works, the District will coordinate and expand 
proven programs that increase economic opportunity 
for residents. Through this initiative we will:    

•  Convene local experts and practitioners to define 

economic mobility in DC and gather data on poverty 
and poverty reduction programs. 

•  Create a research scientist position charged with 

evaluating poverty reduction programs, proposing new 
approaches, and evaluating them to see what works. 

•  Prioritize job training programs that specifically target 

hard-to-employ, chronically unemployed, and/or 
geographically isolated residents.

by 2023

Neighborhoods have been shown to shape a child’s 
opportunity for economic mobility.30 Opportunity Zones 
were created by the federal government to provide 
tax incentives for investments in new businesses and 
commercial projects in low-income communities. 
District Government has a limited ability to influence 
these private investments; however, collective impact 
approaches have been shown to bring people together 
in a structured way to achieve shared goals. Collective 
impact approaches involve various partners developing 
shared outcomes, committing to track and report on 
those outcomes, and working together to achieve them. 
By creating a high-profile, place-based approach, we 
can ensure that communities get the most out of this 
new federal government program. Therefore, through 
this initiative we will:  

•  Identify 3 of the 25 Census Tracts in Wards 7 and 8 

certified as Opportunity Zones to pilot a place-based 
effort to increase economic mobility using a collective 
impact approach. 

•  Work with residents and businesses in the identified 
Census Tracts to co-create a shared vision for their 
communities. Then, we will work with local nonprofits 
to develop key shared outcomes around economic 
mobility.  

•  Convene regular meetings with government, 

nonprofits, and private companies to track and report 
the identified outcomes in each Census Tract.

 Double the number of DC youth that graduate from college 
by 2030

Although roughly 100,000 students31 are enrolled in 
one of DC’s colleges and universities each year, most 
of these students32 move from outside of Washington, 
DC to attend college. A college education provides 
one of the strongest pathways to economic security, 
yet too few students are graduating from college. In 
2015, District officials estimated that 56% of students 
who graduated from high school in 2008 did not finish 
college within six years.33 There are two affordable 
options for DC’s college-bound youth: the University of 
the District of Columbia (the only public institution of 
higher education in DC) and the District of Columbia 
Tuition Assistance Grant (which is intended to offset 
out-of-state tuition). Through this initiative, we will 
invest in both in-state and out-of-state pathways to 
higher education. In addition, we will: 

•  Use evidence-based approaches to increase the 
number of DC students that apply to college and 
use the DC Tuition Assistance Grant. 

•  Invest in critical capital improvements, including 

a renovation of the Van Ness Campus, at the 
University of the District of Columbia to drive 
improved academic outcomes.

•  Identify barriers to full-time study (e.g. housing, 

textbook, and transportation costs) at the University 
of the District of Columbia.

 Train 1,000 DC residents to participate in the commercial 
building sector by 2030

The building industry in Washington, DC is booming. 
Between 2001 and 2018, nearly 200 million square feet 
of development occurred.34 At the same time, DC has 
a history of adopting some of the most progressive 
green building requirements in the country and was 
named the world’s first LEED Platinum city.35 The 
District’s First Source program is designed to provide 
DC residents priority consideration for all new jobs 
created by municipal financing and development 
programs. However, many unemployed city residents 
do not have the advanced skills necessary to access 
jobs in commercial building trades. Therefore, through 
this initiative we will: 

•  Work with UDC, unions, and green building 

organizations to develop a green building apprentice 
program to increase the number of residents with 
the skills necessary to participate in the development 
boom. 

•  Continue to support the Department of Employment 

Services (DOES) office charged with ensuring the 
successful implementation of the First Source program.

•  Use additional resources to improve the protocols 

and policies regarding data capture and monitoring of 
contracts that are subject to First Source.

•  Continue to invest in existing pathways to the green 
economy, such as Solar Works DC, and explore new 
green pathways such as high school academies in 
partnership with businesses.

The innovation pipeline consists of several steps: 
research and development, commercialization, 
startup, and growth. These steps track the path from 
an idea to a mature company. Although DC is home 
to significant growth companies and a strong growth 
equity ecosystem, it lags in startup density and 
availability of capital for startups. A few steps in the 
innovation pipeline could be improved and, in turn, 
lead to increased economic growth and diversity. 
DC’s Economic Strategy launched several efforts 
to address this, including the establishment of an 
Inclusive Innovation Fund. This fund is currently in 
development with $1.5 million in seed funding from 
District Government and is intended to expand access 
to capital for underrepresented entrepreneurs. 

Building on these efforts, we will:   

•  Map all existing resources available at each stage of 

the innovation pipeline.

•  Assemble additional partners and programs to 

address gaps in the innovation pipeline, strengthen 
existing efforts, and launch new efforts to support 
startups.

Each year, DC’s universities invest more than half of 
a billion dollars in research and development.36 In 
addition, the region is home to regulators and funders 
such as the Food and Drug Administration and the 
National Institute of Health. Yet, DC lags behind 
other metropolitan regions in the commercialization 
of ideas — a critical step in the innovation pipeline. 
The Pathways to Inclusion Report (DMPED, 2016) 
and the subsequent DC Economic Strategy (DMPED, 
2017) outlined several steps to increase early stage 
investment in businesses led by underrepresented 
entrepreneurs. Since then, in 2017, Howard University’s 
Inclusive Innovation Incubator (In3) opened to provide 
incubator and community space at Howard University 
to underrepresented entrepreneurs. In 2018, the 
District partnered with The Marathon Foundation 
to create the DC Inclusive Innovation Fund to invest 
in early stage businesses led by underrepresented 
entrepreneurs. Building on these efforts, through this 
initiative we will: 

•  Provide seed funding for the DC Inclusive Innovation 

Fund to help raise capital and support DC 
entrepreneurs. 

•  Expand In3, or create similar programs in collaboration 
with other DC universities, private businesses, and the 
federal government. 

•  Continue to showcase innovation in DC through

 Strengthen support to weather federal government 
shutdowns 

As the capital of the United States, DC’s economy is 
linked to the federal government. In fact, the federal 
government directly employs roughly 200,000 people 
in DC. This number does not include the additional 
contractors and retail employees that rely on economic 
activity generated by federal workers. For example, 
during the 2018-2019 partial government shutdown, 
an additional 112,500 contractors were out of work.37 
When the largest employer in the region closes, there 
are tremendous impacts on the economy. Federal 
government appropriations now allow the District to 
continue spending locally-generated revenue in the 
event of a federal government shutdown. Starting in 
2018, the District Government has even stepped in 
to maintain the 126 National Park Service properties 
located in DC. We will strengthen support for 
residents, businesses, and local government to weather 
federal government shutdowns. Through this initiative, 
we will:

•  Build off Financially Fit DC and launch a financial literacy 

program to promote emergency savings accounts and 
provide financial coaching, prioritizing low-income 
residents and federal contractors. 

•  Safeguard and assess the number of days in reserve. 

•  Partner with local cultural institutions, such as museums 
and restaurants, as well as other civic and philanthropic 
partners to offer subsidized admission and other 
incentives (e.g. restaurant week) that boost tourism in 
the event of a federal government shutdown, helping to 
reduce the shutdown’s economic impact. 

•  Compile an after-action report from the most recent 

shutdown to gather lessons learned, inventory 
government and non-government aid, and identify gaps.

Current homeowners in rapidly growing neighborhoods 
of Washington, DC fear displacement in anticipation 
of community revitalization efforts that drive property 
appreciation and, therefore, higher property taxes 
and cost of living.  Several District Government 
programs are already available for property tax relief, 
including caps, tax credits, deductions, abatements, 
and deferrals for certain eligible property owners. 
In addition, myriad programs exist that could help a 
homeowner reduce the cost of owning and operating a 
home (such as programs to reduce the cost of utilities 
and repairs, or to help homeowners generate revenue 
such as by allowing room rentals or the construction 
of accessory dwelling units). However, these programs 
are not packaged and marketed to cost-burdened 
homeowners. Therefore, through this initiative we will: 

•  Inventory existing programs that reduce the cost of 

owning and operating a home (such as weatherization, 
property tax relief, and loans for small repairs). 

•  Conduct focus groups with homeowners to identify 
gaps and determine reasons for underutilization of 
programs.  

•  Launch “Front Door,” a user-friendly website to access 

and learn about programs to facilitate navigating 
existing programs.

•  Identify and create any new programs to fill gaps. 

•  Bundle and market these programs to cost-burdened 

homeowners.

The amount of household income that is spent on 
housing costs is referred to as housing cost burden. 
Roughly 40% of DC renters spend more than 35% 
of their income on housing, with 25% spending more 
than 50%. These cost-burdened and extremely cost-
burdened renters struggle to afford to live in DC 
and often accept substandard housing conditions to 
remain close to their jobs and social support. The 
District already has strong protections for renters 
but the fear of retaliation or loss of affordable units 
adds complexity to this issue. Fear is compounded for 
undocumented immigrants. Therefore, we will address 
these issues in tandem to improve living conditions, 
while protecting renters from displacement. Through 
this initiative we will:

•  Revisit the Housing Preservation Strike Force Report 

and launch an internal task force, with a sharp focus on 
additional actions to minimize renter displacement.

•  Identify mechanisms and processes to align eviction 

prevention case management with property 
inspections.

•  Partner with organizations to support undocumented

struggling to cope with rising administrative costs.

•  Target struggling businesses in these areas for

we will increase access to capital for small upgrades or 
improvements and target services such as marketing, 
research, and innovation consulting.

 Strengthen pathways to homeownership for District residents

For many, homeownership is an important pathway to 
building wealth. The District’s share of homeowners 
peaked in 2007 at 47.2 percent. It has continued to 
decline since then and fell to 40.7 percent in 2017. 
This is below the national average of 64.4 percent 
but similar to other major cities. The District has 
long supported prospective homeowners through 
programs like Home Purchase Assistance Program 
(HPAP), Employer Assisted Housing Program (EAHP), 
and Negotiated Employee Assistance Home Purchase 
Program (NEAP), which offer financial assistance 
to District residents and/or District Government 
employees. To strengthen pathways to homeownership, 
through this initiative we will:

•  Call on bankers and lenders to provide special loans 

for DC Government workers who want to buy a home 
in the neighborhoods they serve.

 Activate Poplar Point and the RFK Campus as places for DC 
residents to live and work

Height restrictions and the inability to annex 
neighboring land limits the amount of space available for 
development in the District. At the same time, there are 
very few large parcels of land available for development. 
These constraints make it difficult to increase the supply 
of housing and keep up with the pace of population 
growth. The RFK Stadium Campus and Poplar Point 
represent two of the remaining areas in DC available 
for large tract development. The District has been in on-
going conversations with community members, property 
owners, and the federal governments. Going forward, 
through this initiative, we will:

•  Convert the nearly 27 acres of asphalt at RFK to 

provide greater community amenities.

•  Continue to activate the remainder of the RFK Campus 

as a place for DC residents to live, work, and play.

•  Work with the federal government to transfer the 100

The city’s population has risen every year since 2006 
and has soared over the last decade, increasing by 
more than 100,000 people. The DC Office of Planning 
projects that DC’s population will continue to grow 
to over 894,000 people by 2035.40 The housing cost 
burden is projected to increase as the gap between 
housing supply and demand widens and as housing 
prices continue to grow at a faster rate than incomes. 
The District’s zoning regulations stipulate how a 
property is used as well as the size and location of the 
building. The District updated its zoning regulations 
in 2016. In some areas of the city, this increased the 
density allowable by right (i.e. without the need 
for special review). Not all of affordable housing is 
subsidized. If the supply of housing more closely 
matches the demand for housing, then the cost of 
housing will be more affordable. Therefore, we will 
launch an effort to rapidly increase the supply of 
market-rate (unsubsidized) affordable housing units. 
Through this initiative we will: 

•  Identify residential and mixed-use parcels that are not 

built to currently allowable density. 

•  Conduct focus groups with property owners to 

understand barriers to increased density (e.g. access to 
financing, lack of awareness). 

•  Develop tools to help property owners create new 

housing. This will help increase the supply of housing to 
keep pace with population growth.

•  Study the impacts of building taller and more densely 

and how that could address the need for more 
affordable housing. 

•  Support the development of Accessory Dwelling Units 

through the Housing Production Trust Fund.

RESILIENT DCGOAL 11.4.2  

 Preserve 100% of the existing subsidized affordable housing stock 

Many federal and District Government programs 
subsidize the creation of privately owned affordable 
housing, supplementing public housing that is owned 
and operated by the government. These subsidy 
programs offset the reduced revenues that result 
from lower, more affordable rents. Non- and for-profit 
developers combine these subsidies with traditional 
financing and other sources to develop affordable 
housing. Most of these subsidies require the building 
owner to maintain a period of affordability, some 
of which are expiring. Between 2006 and 2014, the 
city lost at least 1,000 units of subsidized housing. 
An additional 13,700 units have subsidies that are 
set to expire by 2020. In 2015, Mayor Muriel Bowser 
established the DC Housing Preservation Strike Force 
to develop a plan to preserve existing affordable 
housing covenants that are due to expire. The Task 
Force released its final report in November 2016. 
Now, the District’s first Housing Preservation Officer 
is working to create and utilize a Housing Preservation 
Fund to stem the loss of subsidized affordable housing. 
Through this initiative we will: 

•  Identify and connect with owners of currently 
affordable properties and provide financial and 
technical assistance to owners to preserve affordable 
housing. 

•  Invest an additional $15 million into the Housing 

Preservation Fund.

 Produce 12,000 new units of affordable housing by 2023

Demand for housing is rising as DC’s population grows. 
As a result, the cost of housing is rising as well. Housing 
supply is not keeping up with the pace of population 
growth. This includes the supply of subsidized 
affordable housing. The National Association of 
Realtors forecasts that, over the next twenty years, 
DC’s median home price will increase by 3.9% per year, 
while median income will increase by only 2.8% per 
year. In 2017, 47.9% of households in DC experienced 
rental cost burden. The Housing Production Trust Fund 
(HPTF) is the major tool used to produce and preserve 
affordable housing in the District of Columbia. It is 
a special revenue fund that provides gap financing 
for projects affordable to low- and moderate-income 
households. The HPTF was created by the Housing 
Production Trust Fund Act of 1988. The program is 
funded through 15% of revenue from deed recordation 
and transfer taxes, as well as through the District’s 
general fund. Mayor Muriel Bowser has committed 
$100 million annually to the fund each year of her 
administration — more than any city per capita in the 
country. Through this initiative we will:

•  Increase the annual investment in the Housing 

Production Trust Fund to $130 million in order to create 
12,000 new units by 2023.

•  Learn from private sector approaches to increase 

affordable housing, such as the Federal City Council’s 
Affordable Housing Initiative.

•  Craft programs to produce deeply affordable housing 

for our most vulnerable families and individuals.

•  Invest in more workforce housing for teachers, social 

workers, police officers, and firefighters.

 Secure a regional commitment to house seven million people by 2050

The daytime population of DC is nearly double that 
of its nighttime population. Workers from around 
the region commute into DC on a regular basis. The 
District of Columbia is only 68 square miles but 
anchors an economy reaching into several states. 
Population growth is expected to outpace supply 
throughout the region. Without an integrated regional 
approach, this growth could stress transit systems, 
exacerbate rising housing costs, and pose other 
challenges. That’s why the Mayor has committed to 
producing 36,000 units of housing in DC alone and 
challenged the region to creating 240,000 units across 
the region by 2025. This would put the region on the 
path to housing seven million people by 2050. The 
Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments 
has a membership of 300 elected officials from 24 
local governments, the Maryland and Virginia state 
legislatures, and U.S. Congress.

Make transportation cheaper 

The Washington Metro Area faces relatively high 
congestion delays and costs. These transportation 
costs are offset when residents have access to public 
transit or live close enough to work that walking or 
biking is a viable option. Unfortunately, the lowest 
income areas of DC are also some of the most 
underserved by Metro. Employers can subsidize their 
employees’ transportation costs, including transit 
and biking. In addition, the District can help subsidize 
certain bus routes. The District has already created 
at least 6 different transit subsidy programs (e.g. 
seniors, children, adult learners, and individuals with 
a disability). Going forward, through this initiative, we 
will:

•  Make public transportation free for certain bus routes.

•  Call on employers to offer paid mobility programs and 

cash out programs (such as providing cash or transit 
subsidies to employees who do not park at work).

 Make transportation more convenient

The District’s population has grown significantly over 
the past decade leading to increased congestion. In fact, 
DC is the 18th most congested city in the world.41 Three 
quarters of public transit riders and half of drivers face 
commutes of over 30 minutes.42 Some neighborhoods, 
particularly in Ward 8, have less access to public transit 
and less jobs, resulting in disproportionally longer 
commute times. Recently, the District started a Transit 
Priority Program and has installed Transit Signal Priority 
at almost 200 intersections. Going forward, through this 
initiative, we will:

•  Increase services in neighborhoods with minimal public 
transportation access through subsidized micro-transit 
mini-shuttles or partnerships with ride-sharing services.

•  Call on regional transit providers (WMATA, MARC, 

VRE, Circulator) to improve regional integration (such 
as coordinated schedules, increased Union Station 
capacity and frequency, fare integration, free transfers) 
and expand night and weekend service for key 
residential and employment zones.

will:

•  Significantly speed up movement through DC by 

designating bus rapid transit lanes, and non-traditional 
vehicle “mobility corridors” for bikes, ride-sharing 
pools, and scooters. This will include a $122M 
investment to create the K Street Transitway, providing

commuters get to work by walking or biking. When 
neighborhoods have a high mix of uses (e.g. office, retail, 
residential) within walking distance, then residents are 
more likely to walk or bike to run their daily errands. 
This helps reduce congestion and transportation costs, 
and improves the environment. To further increase the 
walkability and bikeablity of DC, through this initiative, 
we will:

•  Improve walkability and neighborhood amenities

1.6.1   

 Expand access and improve the quality of early childhood education  
in all eight wards

Early childhood education ensures that children get 
a head start and allows working parents to continue 
to work. It is, therefore, an important tool to address 
existing education and economic gaps. DC already 
offers free, high-quality, full-day pre-kindergarten 
education to 3- and 4-year-olds across all wards in 
Washington, DC. However, many families must balance 
the high costs of early child care with the income 
earned from returning to work. Through this initiative, 
we will:

•  Develop industry-leading standardized metrics to 

measure and incentivize quality improvements in all 
child care and pre-K centers.

1.6.2  

 Support highly effective teachers 

Recent education reforms have led to significant 
improvement DC’s K–12 school system. The District 
remains committed to retaining high-performing 
teachers and increasing the quality of education for 
DC’s youth. The average teacher turnover rate in DC 
public schools is 25%, which is higher than the national 
average of 16%. At the same time, according to the 
National Center for Education Statistics, DC teachers 
are among the highest paid in the nation, even after 
adjusting for cost of living. This high rate of turnover 
makes educating students more expensive and can 
make the District’s education goals harder to achieve. To 
address this, through this initiative, we will:

•  Create new teacher leadership roles to provide 

additional enriching career pathways and 
opportunities, helping to reenergize the profession.

•  Improve teacher retention through investment in 

teacher housing.

(lowest rated) in Wards 2 and 3. Much of this can be 
attributed to trauma and factors outside of school. 
However, improvements can be made and lessons 
learned from past turnaround schools. Through this

RESILIENT DCGOAL 1Goal 2: Climate Action 

We envision a DC that is prepared for the impacts of climate 
change and where residents and businesses take bold action 
to combat its causes. With the initiatives outlined below, DC 
will uphold the commitments of the Paris climate agreement 
and lead the country in the response to climate change. 

The climate is changing. Heatwaves are longer and more 
frequent. Rainstorms are more intense. Sea level rise makes 
the potential impact of tropical storms worse. Furthermore, 
DC is susceptible to three types of flooding: riverine, coastal, 
and rainfall. Climate change is increasing the likelihood of all 
of these. Risk is not just about the likelihood of something 
bad happening. It is also a function of vulnerability. Climate 
change will disproportionately impact some people more 
than others. DC has long been a leader in the response to 
climate change. In fact, prior planning efforts, such as Climate 
Ready DC, have identified many strategies and ideas. Yet, 
the scale of the climate problem requires a proportionate 
response. 

Therefore, this strategy focuses on implementation and 
measures to institutionalize climate action. Together, we  
will respond to the climate crisis, address the root causes  
of vulnerability, and do our part to cut carbon pollution.

What we know

• Stronger storms, including hurricanes 
and derechos, will be much more 
common.  

• Heat emergencies, currently averaging 
30 days per year, are projected to in-

Our Vision

To be climate resilient by 2050

Climate change is projected to increase the 
frequency and intensity of heatwaves, the mean 
tide of DC rivers, and the frequency and intensity 
of heavy rain events. Average annual temperatures 
have already increased 2°F48  during the last 50 
years and are projected to increase an additional 
4.5°F by the middle of the century.49 In 2018, DC 
experienced 25 heat emergency days (where the 
heat index is 95°F or higher). Climate scientists 
have predicted that DC will experience more than 
twice that by 2080. That means that, in 2080, 
our summer will be one long heat emergency.50 
An increase in heat will cause challenges across 
the city. Vulnerable populations’ lack of access to 
cooling can cause dehydration, and more heat will 
also increase use of air conditioning, putting a strain 
on the electrical grid and increasing greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, water levels for 
both tidal rivers, the Potomac and Anacostia rivers, 
have increased 11 inches in the past 90 years due to 
sea level rise and subsidence. As a result, nuisance 
flooding along our riverfront has increased by more 
than 300%.51 Today’s 100-year precipitation event 
could become a 25-year event by mid-century.52 
The Mayor has committed to being climate resilient 
by 2050. This requires regulatory frameworks that 
include climate resilience, retrofitting buildings, and 
strengthening community response and physical 
protection measures.

RESILIENT DCCLIMATE ACTIONTo be carbon neutral by 2050  

In 2016, the District’s citywide greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions totaled 7.5 million metric tons 
of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e). This 
is approximately 11 tons of CO2e per resident, 
which is comparable to other cities on the East 
Coast.53 This is a 29% decrease since the city’s 
first inventory from 2006 and puts the District 
on track to meet our ambitious climate goals. 
However, there is a long way to go to become 
carbon neutral by 2050. Currently, citywide 
emissions are driven by the energy used to power, 
heat, and cool our buildings (75% of emissions) 
followed by transportation (21%) and waste (4%). 
Within these sectors the main sources of emissions 
are electricity (57%), gasoline (19%), and natural 
gas (18%). The District’s Clean Energy DC plan 
provides a roadmap to achieving our interim goal 
of cutting GHGs in half by 2032. Achieving carbon 
neutrality by 2050 will require innovative policies, 
funding and financing strategies, and participation 
from all stakeholders to ensure a carbon-neutral

The Washington, DC region is experiencing a 
development boom. In fact, in 2018, only Dallas-Fort 
Worth and New York City saw more construction 
starts.54 These buildings are intended to last decades. 
But the future may be much hotter and wetter than 
it is now. As a result, these buildings should be built 
to last to protect residents, visitors, and workers 
during heatwaves, tropical storms, and floods. In 
addition, when possible, building and site design 
should contribute to neighborhood adaptation, which 
could include vegetation to provide cooling and water 
management. Climate Ready DC outlined several 
strategies to increase the resilience of new buildings 
to climate change. These range from providing backup 
power to applying adaptation check lists to large 
developments. To accelerate these strategies and 
strengthen support from the building industry, we will: 

•  Inventory current regulations for new construction and 

substantial rehabilitation.

•  Identify process improvements to relieve regulatory 

burden without weakening requirements. 

•  Strengthen requirements that would address increased 

heat and flood risk (such as passive survivability or a 
building’s ability to support its occupants in the event 
of a power outage). 

•  Train the building industry on green building

most of DC’s building stock is already built. Climate 
Ready DC outlines several strategies focused on 
incentives and retrofits to ensure buildings are safer 
for residents, visitors, and workers during heatwaves, 
tropical storms, and floods. These strategies include 
deep energy retrofits for DC Government buildings 
and floodproofing critical facilities in high-risk areas. To 
accelerate and target this work, we will:  

•  Use climate projections to identify the buildings most 

at risk from heat and flooding. 

•  Assess existing regulations, incentives, and tools 

that can enable building-level adaptation response 
measures, through focus groups and surveys with 
multiple building sectors (including homeowners). 

•  Develop, improve, and market a suite of existing 
and new programs, policies, outreach efforts, and 
regulations that fortify buildings to climate-related 
hazards. 

•  Develop policies and programs to support the 

relocation and removal of uses in areas where building 
retrofits are inadequate or too expensive, given the 
level of risk.

Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the 
District may issue debt to finance capital projects; 
however, the District’s total debt service may not 
exceed 12% of General Fund revenues within any 
six-year capital planning period. At the same time, the 
District fulfills many of the functions that a city, county, 
and state would in a different jurisdiction. As a result, 
capital needs far exceed available funds. In addition, 
capital projects are often built to last decades and will 
be subject to changes in climate due to global warming. 
Climate Ready DC has outlined several strategies 
to build climate-ready infrastructure — including the 
development of infrastructure resilience guidelines. 
In addition, DC Government has long utilized nature-
based approaches, such as tree planting and rain 
gardens, to achieve multiple benefits (e.g. cleaner air 
and water as well as cooler sidewalks). To accelerate 
this work, while increasing multiple benefits of 
infrastructure, we will: 

•  Create, test, refine, and promote the use of 

infrastructure resilience guidelines and project delivery 
manuals for multiple infrastructure sectors. 

•  Work with independent infrastructure operators (such 

as Pepco and DC Water) to promote the adoption of 
climate resilience guidelines.

•  Require agencies to coordinate capital budget 

requests within their cluster (i.e. organizational groups 
of agencies that report to the same deputy mayor) in 
order to generate more multi-benefit infrastructure 
projects. 

•  Create and utilize clear and explicit scoring criteria 

that align with the District’s priorities (including climate 
action) for capital budget requests. 

•  Charter an expert infrastructure review committee to 
assess agency capital budget requests and advise the 
Executive Office of the Mayor. 

•  Pilot two resilience districts along the Anacostia 
River to illustrate how coordinated, multi-benefit 
infrastructure investments can address flood risk and 
deliver additional benefits (see Resilient Anacostia 
River Focus Area).

RESILIENT DCGOAL 22.1.4  

 Design climate-ready neighborhoods and developments

Land use and urban design have an important role to 
play in climate resilience. Quality of life and building 
safety are influenced by the neighborhoods around 
them and the resilience of a city is defined by the sum 
of its neighborhoods. The impacts of climate change 
(such as rising sea levels, increased frequency of heavy 
rains, and increases in the frequency of heat events) 
will affect all neighborhoods. Areas along the Anacostia 
River, such as Buzzard Point, Hill East, and Poplar 
Point, are primed for redevelopment and significantly 
at risk from climate change. DC is currently updating 
its Comprehensive Plan, which will include climate 
resilience. To accelerate this work at the neighborhood 
level, we will:

•  Gather lessons learned from the Buzzard Point Vision 

Framework and Design Review Guide process.

•  Identify three to five neighborhoods and/or large 

tract developments in addition to Hill East and Poplar 
Point with significant climate risk and potential for 
redevelopment. 

•  Create or update the respective small area plan, 

design review guidelines, and/or vision framework, 
in these neighborhoods considering climate risk and 
based on extensive public engagement. 

•  Scale this approach to other neighborhoods in DC.

OBJECTIVE
 Measure and track climate risk (exposure and

2.2.1   

 Create a tool that allows residents to understand climate risk and track 
adaptation progress  

The District released climate projections and scenarios 
in 2015 and a vulnerability and risk assessment in 
2016 as part of the process to create Climate Ready 
DC. This high-level analysis is a critical first step 
in understanding how climate change will impact 
Washington, DC. Further research is needed to 
understand current and future riverine, coastal, and 
interior (rainfall) flood risk. A number of vulnerability 
factors increase the risk for various populations and 
areas of DC. Building on this work, this initiative 
will facilitate a data-driven response to climate risk 
and help prioritize climate adaptation investments. 
Specifically, we will: 

•  Create a community-informed climate vulnerability 

index to prioritize investments where they are needed 
most.

•  Develop an integrated urban flood model that 

combines riverine, coastal, and interior (rainfall) 
flooding. 

•  Compile and publish geospatial data on current 
and projected urban heat island, flood risk, and 
vulnerability. 

•  Publish and maintain a public geospatial tool that 
communicates climate risk and climate adaptation 
progress. This tool will be managed by an expert who 
will be responsible for updates, maintenance, and 
assisting public, private, and nonprofit institutions in 
using the tool to allocate scarce resources and drive 
collective action to address climate-related risk.

Climate change will have wide-ranging impacts on 
District agencies’ missions, programs, and operations. 
For example, extreme heat both triggers asthma 
attacks and damages transportation infrastructure. 
These impacts will require increased government 
services. Research has shown that every $1 spent on 
mitigating impacts results in $6 saved in future costs.55  
Recognizing this, Moody’s Investors Service and other 
ratings agencies have begun to consider climate 
change risks in their credit analyses and ratings of 
public debt.

The District created the Commission on Climate 
Change and Resiliency in 2017. This interdisciplinary 
commission is charged with informing District 
Government agencies’ responses to climate change. 
The Commission is made up of District residents 
that are experts in a variety of fields — all of whom 
are committed to supporting the District’s continued 
leadership on climate action. Few cities have 
established a similar body, which has the potential to 
accelerate DC’s climate-related work. To realize the 
potential of this body, we will: 

•  Dedicate staff to support the Commission on Climate 

Change and Resiliency. 

•  Create and maintain a dashboard that tracks District 
Government implementation of Climate Ready DC, 
Clean Energy DC, Sustainable DC, and the All-Hazards 
Mitigation Plan. 

•  Regularly report on progress at the Commission’s 

quarterly meetings and disclose climate-related risk 
and adaptation progress annually in the DC budget.

Commission on Climate Change and Resiliency

On February 18, 2017, DC Government created a Commission on Climate Change 
and Resiliency to assess the potential impacts of the changing climate and adverse 
weather events. This includes the District’s ability to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change, as well as prepare, plan for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse 
events. The Commission is tasked with transmitting reports and recommendations 
to the Council and the Mayor, as well as establishing the Climate Change and 
Resiliency Fund. The Commission is made up of eight members appointed by 
Council and eight members appointed by the Mayor. It first met on January 3, 2018.

Climate-related risks do not adhere to administrative 
boundaries. Responding to the threat of climate 
change necessitates a regional response to 
address impacts on regional systems (e.g. energy, 
transportation, and water). The Metropolitan 
Washington Council of Governments has established a 
Climate & Energy Planning Area under its Environment 
Committee. Building on that work, we will:

•  Share climate projections with neighboring jurisdictions 

and institutions. 

•  Advocate for a Climate Resilience Subcommittee of 
the MWCOG Climate Energy & Environment Policy 
Committee and charge it with supporting watershed-
level adaptation efforts.

•  Work with MWCOG to develop a climate adaptation 

planning toolkit for use by MWCOG jurisdictions, 
neighboring jurisdictions, and other institutions.

Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments

The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments is a regional association 
of governments with representatives from DC, Maryland, Virginia, and the federal

The urban heat island effect occurs when construction 
materials, impervious cover, and other factors make 
urban areas warmer than non-urban areas.56 As 
temperatures increase due to climate change, this 
effect will worsen. By targeting resources where 
they are needed most, we can reduce temperature 
differentials and minimize the impact of rising 
temperatures. Several strategies to identify and reduce 
the urban heat island are described in Climate Ready 
DC. Building on that work, we will:  

•  Create a map-based tool that combines data on the 
urban heat island, heat-related illness, tree canopy, 
land cover, cool roofs, and green infrastructure. 

•  Use this tool to prioritize, accelerate, and evaluate 
DGS, DDOT, DHS, DPR, and DOEE investments to 
eliminate urban heat islands (e.g. drinking water, trees, 
plantings, green and cool roofs, paving materials, 
hyperthermia shelter locations). This will prioritize 
resources in areas where the urban heat island effect 
is the worst, such as in Queens Chapel, Michigan Park, 
and Bloomingdale.

•  Ensure all residents have access to free, accessible 
cooling areas or centers within walking distance of 
their home.

as having high flood risk. There are approximately 
2,000 flood insurance policies supported by the 
National Flood Insurance Program active throughout 
the District. However, more than 80% of these are 
in lower-risk areas. This initiative will lower flood risk 
and the cost of flood insurance for businesses and 
residents. Flood insurance is a critical component of 
any climate adaptation strategy as it allows property 
owners to be made whole after a flood and provides a 
financial incentive for hazard mitigation. Through this

Not all climate adaptation measures are focused on 
the built environment. Social resilience refers to an 
individual’s or community’s ability to cope with an 
adverse event, like a flood, heatwave, or any other 
shock. Efforts should be made to help neighbors, 
families, and communities to come together and 
support each other during times of adversity and 
relative calm. Community Emergency Response Team 
(CERT) training courses, which are offered by the 
Homeland Security and Emergency Management 
Agency (HSEMA) through federal funding, train citizens 
to be better prepared to respond after an emergency, 
and Climate Ready DC calls for Community Resilience 
Hubs. Building on these efforts, we will create a two-
pronged program to increase social cohesion and 
resilience. Through this initiative, we will: 

•  Launch a program called Resilience Corps. Resilience 

Corps will consist of paid neighborhood captains 
who work to promote awareness of and adaptation 
to climate change while building social cohesion. The 
captains will be responsible for building neighborhood-
based networks of volunteers in partnership with 
ServeDC. During the steady state, neighborhood 
captains will work to promote existing programs that 
lower risk for vulnerable populations (e.g. mental 
health services and loans for small repairs). In addition, 
the captains will be charged with hosting neighborhood 
block parties that increase neighborliness and 
awareness of and access to services.

•  Pilot Resilience Hubs in trusted community facilities 
in areas with high climate risk that can act as a place 
of refuge and hub for resources and information in 
the event of a disaster. With community input, we will 
pilot this program in one or both of the neighborhoods 
identified in the Resilient Rivers Focus Area.

 Pilot a microgrid on the St. Elizabeths East campus by 2023

Climate change could lead to increased power 
outages for two reasons. First, hotter temperatures 
will increase the need for air conditioning which could 
overwhelm the electric grid. Second, intense storms 
could knock out power from fallen trees and wind. 
In addition to assisting during disruptions caused by 
climate change, microgrids can also help a community 
with other disruptions caused by surges, human error, 
terrorism, and degraded infrastructure. Microgrids 
are distributed energy systems that have the ability to 
separate (or island) themselves from the larger grid. 
This allows them to maintain power in the event of a 
larger outage. Through this initiative we will:  

•  Pilot a microgrid on the St. Elizabeths East campus

RESILIENT DCGOAL 2Goal 3: Smarter DC

We envision a DC that embraces advancements in 
technology, while minimizing the negative consequences of 
change. With the initiatives outlined below, Washington, DC 
will be a technology-enabled city with strong support and 
safeguards for its residents. 

DC needs to be resilient to three types of technological 
change: automation and the future of work, the movement 
of people and goods, and increased cyber threats in an 
increasingly connected city. Automation occurs when human 
labor is replaced by a system or process that operates 
automatically. For example, restaurant orders in many 
airports are now taken via touchscreen, instead of by a 
human server. In 2018, DC, like cities across the country, 
saw the introduction of dockless bikes and scooters, 
autonomous vehicles tests, and electric skateboards. These 
mobility technologies could help lower carbon pollution, 
decrease congestion, and increase access to jobs. They also 
have safety, land use, and economic implications. Finally, 
networked, technology-enabled solutions (i.e. smart city 
approaches) increase efficiency and effectiveness but also 
increase the potential severity of cyberattacks. 

Technological advancements also offer the opportunity to 
do things more efficiently and effectively. In fact, DC is often 
cited as a center for civic technology startups and policy 
innovation. Together, we will take a proactive approach to 
embrace innovation while minimizing the drawbacks.

What we know

• Fewer jobs will be available to 
individuals without an advanced 
degree due to workforce automation 
(e.g. retail, administrative services, and 
accommodation/food service).57

•  There will be a shortage of technology 
workers as employers look for individuals 
with cybersecurity and software 
development skills.58

To be the highest ranked city 
on the EIU Digital Security 
Index by 2025

To meet the demand for 
more jobs and job training in 
automation-resistant industries

“Smart city” technologies, such as big data 
analytics and infrastructure connected by 
broadband and wireless internet, have been used 
throughout the world to make city systems more 
efficient. As District systems become more digitally 
connected, they also become more vulnerable to 
cyberattack if aggressive measures are not widely 
implemented. From 2015 to 2017, DC moved from 
number 18 up to number 15 on the Economist 
Intelligence Unit (EIU) Digital Security Index of 60 
global cities.61 This is an important improvement, 
but in order to protect Washingtonians, visitors, 
and the seat of the national government, DC 
will need to make strategic investments in digital 
security. 

Advancements in technology affect all aspects 
of life. These changes affect not only the type 
and availability of jobs but also the education 
required to do those jobs. In 2017, roughly 76% of 
DC workers were employed in a sector with low 
automatability. However, occupations with the 
highest automatability ratio are low-skill jobs in 
food service, administration services, and retail. 
Furthermore, 7 out of the 10 ZIP codes with the 
most workers in automatable fields have lower per 
capita income and larger populations of people 
of color than the DC average.62  Investments and 
policies that enable DC to create jobs, attract 
companies, and train workers in automation-
resistant industries will lead to a more equitable 
and resilient city.63

RESILIENT DCSMARTER DCTo have a workforce prepared 
for jobs in cybersecurity and 
software development

From 2016 to 2026, the United States Bureau 
of Labor Statistics projects that employment in 
software development and information security 
will increase by 30.7% and 28.5%, respectively. 
As the 9th and 16th fastest growing occupations 
in the U.S., and both with median annual salaries 
over $95,000, encouraging the development of 
these positions and other high-paying IT jobs in 
the city will increase economic growth and help 
DC respond to rapid changes in technology and 
cybersecurity.64

To reduce average commute 
times and costs 

Commuters in DC have some of the longest 
commute times in the country and are suffering the 
consequences in terms of quality of life and in their 
wallets. In 2015, congestion cost Washingtonians 
on average $1,834 annually and annual delays of 
82 hours per commuter.66 Creating an enabling 
environment that promotes improvements to 
mobility technologies while planning for future 
implications of those technologies will position 
DC as a leader in advanced mobility and increase 
residents’ quality of life.  

To maintain first place in 
growth entrepreneurship and 
advance to the top 10 for 
startup activity in the Kauffman 
Index of Startup Activity 

The DC metro area was ranked 1st of 40 
metropolitan areas in growth entrepreneurship, 
but only 25th in startup activity according to 
the Kauffman Index of Startup Activity in 2017.65 
Maintaining the top ranking in entrepreneurship 
and improving DC’s score in startup activity are 
essential to remaining a competitive location for 
technology companies and jobs of the future.

3.1.1   

 Adopt cybersecurity best practices to improve the District Government 
cybersecurity posture

Damage from cyberattacks can compromise systems 
and networks in ways that disrupt critical government 
services. Furthermore, the concentration of symbolic 
and federal government targets makes DC a likely 
target of state- and non-state actors. For example, 
during a five-day period in 2018, DC reviewed and 
mitigated over 330,000 major cyberattacks against 
the DC network. To address these risks, the District 
recently purchased a cyber insurance policy to 
facilitate the efficient restoration of services in the 
event of a successful intrusion. The District also 
requires that contractors maintain a minimum level of 
cyber insurance coverage. To further increase cyber 
protections, DC Government will lead by example and 
adopt cybersecurity best practices that protect critical 
government systems from such attacks. Through this 
initiative we will:

have a significant impact on residents, businesses, 
and visitors. While the District Government does 
not have the authority or ability to monitor and 
secure these networks directly, we can strengthen 
cyber preparedness across all sectors by fostering 
collaboration and education. This will help foster a 
whole community approach to cyber resilience and 
market DC as a safe place to do business as well as 
a leader in cybersecurity innovation. Through this 
initiative we will:

•  Launch a voluntary partnership to educate DC 

businesses, nonprofits, and institutions, and promote

 Ensure that 100% of District agencies plan for cyberthreats by 2023

Successful cyberattacks could disrupt government 
services. District agencies must have plans in place 
to quickly restore services in such an event. Mayor’s 
Order 2012-61 requires each District Government 
agency to develop and maintain a Continuity of 
Operations Plan. These plans outline how the agency 
will continue to deliver services following an adverse 
event (e.g. flood). To date, these plans have focused on 
physical threats. We will integrate cyber resilience into 
every agency’s plan in acknowledgement of increasing 
cyberthreats. Through this initiative, we will:

•  Identify and collect existing language in all agency

Automation and artificial intelligence will change 
the workplace, requiring different skills from human 
workers. In DC, automation will disproportionately 
impact low-income residents and residents of color, 
threatening to displace their jobs and exacerbate 
existing economic inequality. To ensure that DC’s 
workforce is properly prepared or has all the resources 
it needs to prepare for a job transition due to 
automation, we will:

•  Identify job titles and sectors that are projected to be 

at high risk from automation.

•  Map the skills and experience of those at-risk jobs and 
compare them to stable jobs (growing professions with 
a low risk of automation), and identify gaps in skills. 

•  Align workforce programs and resources to fill the skills 

gaps identified in order to transition at-risk workers 
into stable work, expanding training and educational 
opportunities or launching new ones.

automation-resistant industries that show high 
potential for growth in DC — accessible to workers 
of varying skill levels—will help insulate the city from 
the effects of automation and ensure availability of 
high-quality jobs in the future for residents from all 
educational backgrounds. To strengthen the school-

Care work, including jobs in childcare, health 
care, and elder care, represents some of the most 
automation-resistant careers. These sectors are 
also underdeveloped relative to their potential in 
DC. Moreover, the growth of these sectors provides 
important co-benefits for DC families by increasing 
access to quality family care services. For all of 
these reasons, we will promote care economy jobs, 
providing the city’s workforce with increased access to 
affordable family care resources while meeting demand 
with a well-trained workforce. We will: 

•  Identify and reduce barriers to participation in the 

care economy by making it easier to open and operate 
care facilities. For example, we will simplify registration,

RESILIENT DCGOAL 3Goal 4: Safe and Healthy 
Washingtonians

We envision a DC where every neighborhood is safe, our 
residents are strong and healthy, and all Washingtonians can 
thrive. With the initiatives outlined below, DC will address 
disparities in health and reduce crime in all neighborhoods.  

Though the overall health of DC residents has improved over 
the last decade, persistent health disparities are pervasive 
and evident by race and ethnicity, income, and neighborhood. 
For example, while infant mortality in DC has declined 
overall, babies born to Black mothers are three times more 
likely to die before their first birthday than babies born to 
White mothers. In addition, life expectancy varies across 
neighborhoods by as much as 21 years.69 These disparate 
health outcomes correlate with environmental conditions 
— including the impact of community violence — illustrating 
the impact that social, economic, and physical conditions 
can have on an individual’s wellbeing. Addressing these 
factors, called the social determinants of health, is critical 
to closing the gap in health outcomes, preventing violence, 
and building resilience for all District residents. In addition to 
comprehensively working to improve health for all residents, 
the District has adopted a public health approach to violence 
prevention that emphasizes the holistic needs of individuals 
and their communities. Together, we will strengthen efforts to 
improve health and safety for all District residents. 

What we know

• Health is determined by social, 
environmental, and physical conditions.

• Life expectancy varies across DC  
neighborhoods by as much as 21 years.70

• While overall violent crime has 
decreased in recent years, homicides 
have spiked in the last year.

• There was a 178% increase in fatal 
overdoses due to opioid use from 2014 
to 2016.71

Our Vision

To reduce crime in all eight wards

Like in most cities, crime is concentrated in certain 
areas of DC. For example, in 2018, 21% of all violent 
crime occurred in Ward 8, while only 2% occurred 
in Ward 3. The District has recognized that a public 
health approach that emphasizes the holistic needs 
of individuals and their communities is necessary 
to prevent and reduce crime. Investments in public 
safety, housing, employment, transportation, and 
wellness programs lay the foundation for District 
residents to live in communities where they 
feel safe and supported. Healthy communities 
— those that have quality schools, economic 
opportunities, clean and well-designed physical 
environments, and structured activities that 
young people find meaningful — have prosocial 
benefits that create conditions which improve 
community safety and protect against violence. 
Precision policing, support to reduce recidivism, 
and access to opportunity will also help break the 
cycle of violence that still affects many of DC’s 
neighborhoods.  

To eliminate racial and 
geographic disparities in  
health outcomes 

Many of DC’s residents and neighborhoods enjoy 
exceptional health; however, significant racial and 
geographic disparities exist in health outcomes. 
Residents and neighborhoods experiencing poor 
health outcomes are also generally faring worse 
across other factors that determine health, 
including income, housing, transportation, food, 
medical care, environment, and safety. For 
example, low educational attainment correlates 
with risk for living in poverty as well as with higher 
rates of fair or poor health, including higher 
prevalence and poorer outcomes for a range of 
health conditions including stroke, heart disease, 
and diabetes. In addition, the increased health 
risks of unemployment are well known, showing 
that people who are unemployed are 54% more 
likely to have fair or poor health, and 83% more 
likely to develop stress-related conditions and 
other diseases. Holistic efforts that combine 
improvements in clinical care with efforts focused 
on social, environmental, and economic factors will 
help address disparities in health outcomes.

4.1.1   

 Reverse 2019’s spike in homicides with precision policing targeted at 
illegal guns and repeat violent offenders

Although overall violent crime in DC is down and near 
record lows, shootings and homicides have increased. 
The availability of guns and lack of meaningful 
consequences for carrying or using guns is partly to 
blame. Recently, the District has created an office that 
engages shooters in conflict resolution, job training, 
and mental health counseling. Through this office, the 
Pathways Program has engaged 50 people per year 
and has shown promising early results. To continue this 
work, through this initiative, we will:

•  Provide stronger supervision and prosecution of 

repeat gun offenders.

•  Advocate for stronger gun control law nationally.

The District is the only jurisdiction in the country 
where the supervision of adults and juveniles 
convicted of local crimes is undertaken by the federal 
government. For example, the housing of felony 
offenders is overseen by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 
meaning that offenders can be incarcerated thousands 
of miles from DC and their support networks. In 
addition, the supervision of individuals on probation 
is currently done by Court Services and Offender 
Supervision Agency, a federal agency. This can 
complicate coordination with local agencies, including

4.2.1   

 Address the opioid epidemic through a roadmap with prevention 
strategies 

As opioid-related deaths continue to rise across the 
nation, Washington, DC has also experienced an 
alarming increase in fatal opioid overdoses. There were 
83 opioid-related deaths in 2014, 114 in 2015, 231 in 
2016, and 279 in 2017. There was a 178% increase in fatal 
overdoses due to opioid use from 2014 to 2016. In 2018, 
the District released LIVE. LONG. DC. a strategy to 
reduce opioid use, misuse, and related deaths. Going 
forward, through this effort, we will: 

•  Reverse more than 700 overdoses through Naloxone 

kits, and train residents in Naloxone use.

•  Provide treatment to thousands of individuals with 

opioid use disorder, and ensure recovery support and 
care coordination for our residents.

•  Actively monitor trends in opioid use and tailor 

responses based on real-time data.

•  Create innovative public education campaigns 

targeting those who are most likely to overdose on 
heroin and educate young people on the dangers of 
misusing prescription opioids.

 Establish integrated neighborhood health and social services 
delivery systems

Despite progress and prosperity in recent years, 
families in certain neighborhoods continue to lag 
behind their fellow residents in health and economic 
mobility. This is due to many factors across health, 
education, safety, and social environment. Many 
existing programs address individual factors, but 
navigating and combining these programs can be 
difficult for families that are already struggling. 
Comprehensive, place-based programs can help 
combine government services to address social 
determinants of health in a holistic way. Therefore, 
through this initiative, we will launch Families First  
DC in 10 communities and:   

•  Support community-driven grant processes to

 Provide a complete continuum of care for residents with severe 
mental health illness or substance abuse disorders  

Like many cities across the nation, the District faces 
challenges in ensuring all residents have access to 
the array of mental health care services that can 
help reduce the epidemic of opioid use and support 
communities experiencing increased violence and 
trauma. Gaps in the Medicaid service array and a 
complex system of oversight have impacted the 
District’s capacity to manage behavioral health services 
in a holistic way. Many District agencies provide 
ancillary behavioral health services, including the 
school system, foster care and protective services, 
and the justice system, among others. This division of 
services has sometimes resulted in service gaps and 
confusion about points of entry, and a  disconnect 
between beneficiaries’ physical and behavioral health 
care.  Mayor Bowser has released several strategies 
and plans that call for increased coordination of 
health care services, including LIVE. LONG. DC. 
— the District’s strategy to end illegal opioid use. 
The District’s Department of Behavioral Health has 
secured additional resources that will, in part, support 
a comprehensive approach to behavioral health care, 
focusing on promotion, prevention, treatment, and 
recovery services. 

Through this initiative, we will: 

•  Review the authorities that govern behavioral health 
services (i.e., Mental Health Rehabilitation Services, 
MHRS, and Adult Substance Abuse Rehabilitation 
Services, ASARS) to identify gaps in DC’s current 
service array. 

•  Seek to increase the number and type of mental 

health services billable to Medicaid, enhancing 
coordination and supporting better data. 

•  Work with the Department of Healthcare Finance 

to establish new services and/or enhance those 
services currently available.

 By 2022, ensure all high-risk Medicaid members are in a health home 
and all of Medicaid is in managed care

Despite having the second highest health care 
coverage rate in the nation, District residents still 
struggle to achieve positive health outcomes and 
many are not accessing needed treatment.  Building 
off the tremendous coverage gains the District 
achieved under the ACA coverage expansion, DHCF’s 
strategic vision is to transform the health system into 
a more organized, accountable, and person-centered 
system that supports Medicaid beneficiaries across 
the continuum of their health journey. As the largest 
payer in the District, the District Medicaid program 
has the ability and the responsibility to align District-
wide efforts to optimize health system performance, 
improve beneficiary experience and quality, improve 
population health, and reduce per capita cost of health 
care.  The DC Medicaid program provides health 
insurance coverage to over 250,000 District residents. 
Most of the Medicaid beneficiaries participate in 
the managed care program where managed care 
companies coordinate beneficiary care. The remainder 
of beneficiaries, or nearly one quarter of the Medicaid 
population (approximately 51,000 residents), are in 
the Medicaid Fee for Service (FFS) program where 
care is often unmanaged and not coordinated. The 
average FFS beneficiary cost is nearly three times the 
managed care cost. As is often the case for individuals 
with complex health needs, the health care system can 
become fragmented for the very individuals who most 
need coordinated, person-centered care. This initiative 
supports the transformation of the health care 
delivery system for nearly half of the FFS Medicaid 
beneficiaries into a more organized, accountable, and 
person-centered system through the expansion of 
health homes and managed care (for this initiative, FFS 
beneficiaries are defined as non-dual aged, blind, and 
disabled adults).

Building on efforts to connect Medicaid beneficiaries 
with a health home and better coordinated care, we will:   

•  Transition nearly half of the FFS Medicaid 

beneficiaries into managed care by 2022.

•  Increase branding and awareness about current 

health homes — My Health GPS program, the primary 
care health home, and My DC Health Home targeting 
individuals with severe mental illness.

•  Enhance current health home programs to better 

address care coordination needs for high-risk 
beneficiaries.

•  Engage health care providers, District agencies, 
community partners, and other stakeholders to 
support practice transformation to value-based care 
models.
