MAURICIO RODAS 

MAYOR OF THE METROPOLITAN DISTRICT OF QUITO

Throughout their history, the people of Quito ahave shown 
their  ability  to  respond  to  the  numerous  challenges  that 
their city has faced. Nevertheless, as Quito’s urban area and 
the  challenges  it  faces  become  more  and  more  complex, 
the  city  requires  a  new,  more  solid  foundation  to  create 
plans and actions to be able to systematically respond to 
our  vulnerabilities.  The  Quito  Resilience  Strategy  provides 
a  framework  for  the  city  to  develop  the  planning  and 
preparedness necessary for us to achieve our 2040 vision, 
building on our strengths and addressing our challenges.

This  Strategy’s  overarching  principles  are  to  ensure 
a  high  quality  of  life  for  all  the  residents  of  the  Quito 
Metropolitan  District.  These  principles  are  based  on  five 
multidimensional pillars of action. Central to these actions 
are  citizen  participation,  environmental  management  to 
support the life of our residents, and the construction of the 
city’s first metro line. Together, these will lead to achieving  
an integrated and efficient city. Other key elements of the 
Strategy  include  developing  capacity  through  inclusion, 
strengthening  our  urban  fabric,  and  guaranteeing  safety 
and security from both natural and manmade threats. 

Our  partnership  with  The  Rockefeller  Foundation  through 
the  100  Resilient  Cities  initiative  has  made  it  possible  to 
create a rigorous strategy that integrates actions by various 
municipal departments as well as members of civil society 
and  academia.  The  partnerships  created  through  this 
initiative led to valuable exchanges of ideas, best practices 
and lessons learned from around the world. 

This strategy is much more than an important input for the 
city’s future. It represents a commitment to following and 
integrating its principles into a governing approach. At the 
one  year  anniversary  of  Quito’s  hosting  the  New  Urban 
Agenda  Habitat  III  conference,  we  reaffirm  this  important 
step toward achieving a resilient city in which all of Quito’s 
residents can live together safely and securely.

MICHAEL BERKOWITZ  

PRESIDENT OF 100 RESILIENT CITIES

On  behalf  of  the  entire  100  Resilient  Cities  team,  I  want  to 
congratulate  the  city  of  Quito,  Mayor  Mr.  Mauricio  Rodas, 
and  Chief  Resilience  Officer  David  Jacome,  on  the  release  of 
the Resilient Quito, a major milestone for the city and for our 
partnership. This document lays out an extraordinary vision of 
urban resilience that can serve as a model to all. We are excited 
to see this ambitious Strategy take shape and lead to a stronger 
and even more dynamic Quito.

Standing  2,800  meters  above  sea  level  at  the  center  of  the 
world on the equator, Quito is the political heart of Ecuador. 
The city not only boasts a rich history and cultural patrimony, 
represented  by  its  beautiful  historic  center  that  received 
recognition as the first UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978, but 
also an incredible wealth of biodiversity. With its central role as 
the host of the Habitat III Conference one year ago, Quito stands 
poised to become a model of urban resilience and signal to the 
rest of the world how the priorities of the New Urban Agenda 
can be realized.

Quito’s Resilience Strategy reflects this potential, the amazing 
progress the city has made in understanding its natural assets 
and  vulnerabilities,  and  how  they  present  opportunities  for 
developing strength and adaptability. To build Quito’s resilience, 
it’s necessary to have a deep understanding of the shocks and 
stresses the city endures, including severe natural hazards such 
as  earthquakes,  landslides,  wildfires,  and  active  volcanos;  a 
history  of  economic  instability;  and  unchecked  urban  sprawl 
and environmental degradation.

Quiteños themselves are key to the city’s Resilience Strategy. 
Known for their solidarity, energy and ingenuity, Quiteños are 
also disproportionately young: 1 out of 2 is under the age of 29. 
In order to harness the momentum this presents; the Strategy 
contains several initiatives that aim to match young talent with 
professional and technical programs that will contribute to the 
city’s economy and strengthen it overall.

Also fundamental to Quito’s resilience-building efforts is its new 
metro  line,  the  city’s  largest  infrastructure  project  in  history. 
Apart from its importance in linking a sprawling city, the new 
system presents an unprecedented opportunity for resilient 

urban development for the benefit of all Quiteños, by enabling 
a  better  quality  of  life  through  connectivity  to  job  centers 
and  to  one  another.  It  also  presents  a  major  environmental 
intervention  that  can  reduce  congestion,  pollution,  and  the 
erosion of the city’s rich biodiversity. 

Other  initiatives  that  will  provide  multiple  benefits  include 
a  program  for  safe  public  spaces;  green 
infrastructure 
interventions  to  protect  vulnerable  neighborhoods  and  the 
transportation  system;  actions  for  embedding  principles  of 
sustainability and resilience in the Innovation Agenda of the city 
and for strengthening the information system with a risk index 
that strategically allows planning for risk reduction.  

This  Strategy  is  only  the  beginning  of  the  exciting  work  to 
come in the months and years ahead. And 100 Resilient Cities’ 
partnership with the city of Quito is also just beginning. Now we 
can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives 
contained in the following pages, which will positively impact all 
Quiteños. We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased 
to be a partner in these efforts. Congratulations to the city of 
Quito!

DAVID JÁCOME POLIT

QUITO’S CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER

Today, when we must work on a global agenda that focuses 
on the well-being of all citizens, and with so many profound 
changes  under  way  in  our  city’s  positive  evolution,  the 
Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  is  in  a  unique  position  to 
take  advantage  of  its  human  and  biological  capital  while 
remaining faithful to its goal of becoming a more robust and 
inclusive city, and to identify our challenges and turn them 
into opportunities to create a prosperous future.

Through  the  Quito  2040  Vision,  the  city’s  residents  have 
decided  that  the  city  will  not  only  have  a  high  quality  of 
life but also be able to maintain that quality of life despite 
the many challenges that it faces and will continue to face 
in  social,  cultural,  economic,  and  environmental  terms. 
Building  resilience  for  the  city  will  ensure  sustainable 
development  for  its  inhabitants  and  set  a  clear  agenda 
for  the  Metropolitan  District’s  variety  of  management 
instruments.

The work reflected in this strategy reveals the Metropolitan 
District of Quito’s strengths an d opportunities as it addresses 
the  city’s  acute  shocks  and  chronic  stresses  and  prepares 
its  citizens  to  face  this  century’s  challenges.  While  the 
scope is quite broad, the Resilience Strategy is not exactly 
a plan in the traditional sense of the word; instead it is an 
invitation to participate in a comprehensive work agenda. 
Resilient Quito establishes the path that we need to follow 
to strengthen our city by integrating procedures, programs, 
and  policies  that  achieve  pointed,  multidimensional,  and 
effective results.

The  problems  we  are  facing  in  the  21st  century  cannot 
be  overcome  with  traditional  tools  and  solutions.  Urban 
resilience  means  taking  on  and  adapting  to  complex 
challenges without forgetting to look ahead to the future. 
It is about being able to change our point of view, critically 
reviewing contributions to and from the city continuously, 
and developing abilities that make us stronger. The Quito 
Resilience Strategy places importance on what is possible. 
It proposes that we take advantage of the existing potential 
of our workforce, and it applies technical resources and best 
practices to equip Quito´s residents for success.

| RESILIENT QUITO1. VISION OF QUITO’S  RESILIENCE STRATEGY 

1.1 WHAT DOES RESILIENT QUITO MEAN?

     The Metropolitan District of Quito builds 
resilience based on its human, biological, and 
geographic diversity. The city is prepared for 
the future thanks to its high adaptive capacity, 
which is in turn based on social and economic 
inclusion. By improving efficiency, the city 
guarantees a  high quality of life for its residents 
and ensures environmental sustainability. Quito 
looks forward, and grows ready to face the 
challenges of the 21st century, emerging as a 
stronger and more equitable city.

Perched high in the Andes, the Metropolitan District of Quito 
(DMQ) stands out for a number of factors formed by its dynamic 
diversity.  At  2,800  meters  above  sea  level,  the  city  sits  amid 
volcanoes and deep valleys. Quito was named a World Heritage 
Site in 1978 not only for its architecture but also because of this 
dramatic  landscape  and  its  biological  diversity.  At  the  same 
time, this cultural and natural wealth is threatened by a variety 
of environmental, economic, and social challenges.
 
The  Quito  Resilience  Strategy  is  based  on  an  analysis  of 
these  dynamics  and  the  weaknesses  and  opportunities 
they  represent.  It  sets  forth  an  integrated,  cross-disciplinary 
approach to the city’s main acute shocks and chronic stresses. 
The Strategy was developed through tools that establish a new 
way  of  planning  as  developed  through  a  resilience  lens.  It  is 
aligned  with  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  the 
New Urban Agenda (NUA), which was approved in Quito during 
Habitat  III,  and  the  Metropolitan  Plan  for  Development  and 
Land Management (PMDOT), which governs the municipality’s 
work. A key contribution of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative for 
the Metropolitan District of Quito is that its resilience-building 
process can be used throughout the city’s planning. It integrates 
the efforts of various levels of government, the private sector, 
civil  society,  and  the  scientific  community.  The  Strategy 

achieves this by through the parameters proposed in the city’s 
comprehensive long-term plan to 2040. These parameters define 
development as centered on achieving a high quality of life for 
all residents, and a city that is integrated, safe, inclusive, and 
prosperous. Fundamental to this vision of DMQ is the city’s first 
metro line, the largest infrastructure project in Quito’s history. 
This project can enable the kind of planning that leads to real 
transformation, of  space, of social structures, and of economic 
development,  and  that  is  a  key  element  in  building  urban 
resilience. The first metro line is also an important component 
in the city’s promotion of mitigation and adaptation to climate 
change. It plays a role in effective risk management and is an 
important opportunity to change the city’s patterns of growth 
and development.
 
With  most  of  the  world’s  population  living  in  urban  areas, 
establishing  urban  resilience  as  a  governing  principle  is 
fundamental to living in fairer and more sustainable societies. 
By  building  a  resilient  Quito,  the  city  will  be  better  able  to 
find  new  opportunities,  capitalize  on  existing  ones,  and  be 
prepared to meet the challenges and risks it will face. This long-
term  commitment  includes  not  only  the  Municipality  as  an 
institution, but all the people of Quito.

| RESILIENT QUITO2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Yaku Water Museum

Resilient Quito highlights the need to develop mechanisms 
that strategically respond to the acute shocks and chronic 
stresses that afflict the city. While the city’s complex location 
creates  structural  vulnerabilities,  other  characteristics, 
such as its human and biological diversity, are clear signs 
of its historic ability to adapt. Resilient Quito is developed 
at a time of transformation for the Metropolitan District of 
Quito,  both  in  terms  of  mobility  and  urban  development. 
Construction  of  the  first  metro  line  and  dedication  to  the 
New  Urban  Agenda,  which  was  approved  in  Quito  during  
Habitat III, define the new planning parameters. 

The DMQ was selected to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities 
(100RC) initiative, which supports cities around the world in 
their efforts to build urban resilience. This opportunity made 
it possible for Quito to analyze the city’s vulnerabilities and 
challenges,  evaluate  its  responsiveness  to  face  them,  and 
apply a planning approach focused on resilience as part of 
the local government’s guiding principles.

The  first  phase  of  this  strategy    consisted    of    preparing 
a  Preliminary  Resilience  Assessment  (PRA)  based  on 
stakeholder  engagement,  action  identification  and  risk 
assessment tools provided by 100RC. With the participation 
of  local  government,  academia,  and  the  private  and  civil 
sector,  The  Resilience  Office  of  Quito  held  a  series  of 
workshops to conduct surveys and interviews to determine 
the acute shocks and chronic stresses most relevant to the 
city. The PRA identified the challenges and helped the CRO 
establish priorities. 

The  second  phase  identified  the  five  key  areas  of  the  city 
with  the  highest  priority  for  support  in  order  to  build 
meaningful resilience. The prioritization process was driven 
by the Municipality’s ongoing actions and inspired by other 
cities’ best practices.  100RC offered technical support, and 
the local government supported the implementation of the 
work. This two-phase process established the pillars, goals, 
and  actions  that  helped  create  the  resilience  strategy,  as 
detailed below.

A. 

INCLUSIVE AND EMPOWERED CITIZENS  
 
Building urban resilience begins with strengthening social fabric. This pillar focuses on 
facilitating participatory processes as guidelines for democracy, validating the public 
administration’s work, and strengthening processes of co-responsibility between 
citizens and the municipality. It aims at strengthening institutional and community 
capacities to build participatory processes and provide clear and effective mechanisms 
for citizen engagement. 

B.  ROBUST AND SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT 

 
Management and conservation of the city’s natural areas make sustainable urban 
development possible. The environmental pillar proposes developing efficient, 
participatory administration mechanisms for these areas that foster environmental 
consciousness and citizen involvement. This pillar also aims to encourage the use of 
nature based solutions for urban problems. 
 

C. 

INTEGRATED AND COMPACT CITY 
 
Scattered and uncontrolled urban sprawl has made the Metropolitan District of Quito 
a segregated and inefficient city. This pillar focuses on controlling urban sprawl, 
maximizing the positive impact of Quito’s first metro line, and creating an integrated and 
efficient mobility system that favors active mobility. 
 

D.  RESOURCEFUL AND SOLID ECONOMY  

 
Building economic resilience requires strengthening productive sectors and diversifying 
lines of business, all with an environment-friendly focus. This pillar creates an economic 
environment conducive to strengthening job supply and demand, with a special focus 
on youth. It fosters a diverse, sustainable, and innovative economy, and promotes the 
food-related economy as a guideline for development.  
 

E.  REFLECTIVE AND SAFE TERRITORY 

 
This fifth pillar focuses on addressing the multiple threats and the high risk exposure 
due to the city’s physical and socioeconomic vulnerability. This fifth pillar seeks to avoid 
creating new risks, mitigate existing risks, and prepare the city to respond to potential 
natural and man-made disasters. 

The strategy also proposes mechanisms that facilitate cross-disciplinary planning and allow continuity over time. This 
includes the institutionalization of the resilience agenda and its monitoring mechanisms, alignment with international 
development plans, adherence to the Metropolitan Plan for Development and Land Management, and training of resilience 
practitioners.

3.2 QUITO: RESILIENCE CONTEXT

Due to its designation as Ecuador’s capital city, its geographic 
position, and its tangible and intangible heritage, the DMQ 
has  an  economic,  ecological,  and  cultural  role  to  play  on 
the world stage. Archaeological remains discovered at the 
foot of Mount Ilaló (at the El Inga site in the southeastern 
part  of  the  city)  show  the  existence  of  workshops  that 
attest  to  the  presence  of  human  settlements  in  the  area 
dating  back  at  least  10,000  years  (Lozano,  1991).  Since 
that  time  and  throughout  its  history,  the  city  has  been  a 
mosaic of cultural diversity expressed through its traditions, 
art,  and  architecture.  The  population  is  settled  along  a 
horizontal  strip  surrounded  by  mountain  ranges  and  high 
peaks,  including  Mount  Pichincha  and  Mount  Itchimbía. 
For  many  years,  these  high  elevations  contained  urban 
sprawl. Within this plateau, the city has many faces, among 
them the Quito Historic City Center (QHCC), whose streets, 
squares,  buildings,  churches,  convents,  and  monuments 
reflect a past that is connected to the present and needs to 
be  preserved.  Another  face  is  modern  Quito,  a  city  driven 
to  become  a  prosperous  urban  center  while  addressing 
structural inequalities. 

From  a  social  perspective, 
  Quito  is  a  young  city.  Its 
demographics  offers  potential  for  significant  economic 
development.  The  working  age  population  (economically 
active) in the city is of higher proportion than the dependent 
population  (children  and  senior  citizens).  If  appropriately 
taken  advantage  of,  the  city’s  current  age  distribution  is 
an  opportunity  to  boost  the  city’s  economic  engine  and 
contribute  to  its  socioeconomic  growth.  Additionally,  the 
city’s  social  capital  is  characterized  by  a  long  tradition  of 
collaborative practices and participation in decision-making 
process  required  for  planning  the  city’s  and  its  diverse 
communities’ development (MDMQ, 2015). The DMQ’s social 
fabric is highly dynamic, which is reflected in the city’s history, 
initiatives, and notable ability for creativity and innovation. 
However, this historic strength has been affected by the social 
fragmentation caused by political factors, social differences, 
and the dynamics of the market, technology and urbanization. 
All of these have had corrosive effects on social cohesion and 
mobility (MDMQ, 2015).

In  environmental  terms,  the  city’s  diverse  ecosystems 
are  part  of  the  planet’s  life  support  systems.  Its  territory 
contains immensely rich valleys and mountains as well as 
conservation corridors that are part of the Tumbes-Chocó-
Magdalena  bioregion,  one  of  the  planet’s  biodiversity 
hotspots.  As  a  result  of  their  biological,  cultural,  and 
social  assets,  these  areas  meet  the  conditions  needed 
for  sustainable  development  opportunities  in  the  DMQ. 
However,  these  areas  are  under  pressure  from  practices 
that  contribute  to  environmental  degradation,  such  as 
mining,  intensive  livestock  grazing,  and  overproduction 
of wood, which are affecting native forests and moorland. 
Urban expansion has also had a detrimental effect on the 
environmental  and  the  city’s  ecology.  All  of  these  actions 
exacerbate  the  stresses  on  the  different  ecosystems, 
contaminate water sources and networks, and put the city’s 
capacity  to  supply  ecosystemic  services  at  risk  (MDMQ, 
2015).

its 

Mobility  significantly  influences  the  quality  of  life  for  city 
residents; 
inefficient  operation  affects  day-to-day 
activities. In the DMQ, inadequate mobility is one of the main 
chronic stresses, reflected mainly in the quality of service, 
measured  by  its  accessibility,  quality,  and  use  of  public 
places;  transfer  time,  coverage,  environmental  impacts 
due to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and decline in air 
quality. The city’s disorganized growth hinder the efforts of 
the municipality to address its citizens’ demands for access 
to  services,  including  transportation.  The  construction  of 
the  city’s  first  metro  line  and  its  integration  with  existing 
mobility systems represent a historic opportunity to rethink 
urban  development  and  its  dynamics.  A  weak  approach 
to capitalizing on this opportunity would reverse the city’s 
potential  for  transformative  action  and  worsen  existing 
segregation and lack of coordination issues.

| RESILIENT QUITOFrom  an  economic  standpoint,  in  addition  to  being  an 
important  financial  center,  the  DMQ  achieves  high  marks  for 
education,  human  talent,  infrastructure,  and  access  to  credit 
(MDMQ,  2015),  all  of  which  are  significantly  better  than  the 
rest of the country. Nevertheless, the lack of job opportunities 
is  an  underlying  problem,  which  is  often  due  to  the  lack  of 
coordination between job-training efforts and the job market 
demands. The city has high concentrations of wealth and levels 
of  inequality  and  informality,  resulting  in  an  economy  that 
shows levels of employment and underemployment that are 
above the national average (INEC 2017). The economy is also 
vulnerable to factors such as the national dependence on oil 
prices and international markets for raw materials, especially in 
the case of the flower industry, the DMQ’s main export. The need 
to strengthen the economy and diversify productive industries 
is  closely  related  to  the  macroeconomics  environment;  in 
Ecuador’s case, this is specifically related to dollarization. The 
absence  of  monetary  management  policy  tools  significantly 
reduces the ability to respond to external economic shocks.

In  relation  to    land  management,  the  city’s  unregulated 
growth affects its functionality and increases its vulnerability 
to  natural  threats,  such  as  earthquakes,  landslides,  and 
wildfires.  The  risk  focal  points  in  the  territory  are  located 
in  places  vulnerable  to  both  natural  and  man-made 
threats.  The  level  of  exposure  is  augmented  by  physical 
and  socioeconomic  factors.  Given  the  city’s  topography, 
many informal settlements are located in areas with non-
mitigable  risk,  such  as  slopes  or  gorges.  Many  of  these 
areas do not have access to public utilities, infrastructure, 
and equipment, making them prone to violence and unsafe 
conditions.  Given  the  demographic  growth  forecasted  for 
these areas in the coming decades, the construction of safe 
habitat needs to be a priority.

4. URBAN RESILIENCE

“Urban resilience refers to the ability of people, communities, companies and 
systems that form part of a city to survive, adapt, and grow regardless of the 
types of acute shocks and chronic stresses they experience.”*

* • Acute shocks are sudden and intense events that threaten a city.
   • Chronic stresses weaken the fabric of a city on a daily or cyclical basis.

- 100 Resilient Cities

Planning  for  urban  resilience  requires  an  understanding  of 
the  systems  and  subsystems  that  make  up  the  city  and  its 
surroundings. “Socioecological systems” refer to environmental 
life  support  systems,  which  includes  moorlands,  mountains, 
forests  and  rivers;  while  “sociotechnological  systems”  are 
related  to  infrastructure,  mobility  systems,  and  water  or 
electrical  supply  (Meerow  et  al.,  2016).  The  interaction  and 
interdependence  between  such  systems  generates  synergies 
and  clashes.  The  constantly  changing  dynamics  of  these 
systems require prepared responses and resilience structures 
that both support and depend on each other (Kristinsson, 2012). 

In a changing world, cities and their populations need to adjust, 
recover quickly and come out stronger after acute shocks and 
stresses  in  their  habitat.  Building  urban  resilience  does  not 
mean returning to a previous or normal condition. IIt is about 
developing the capacity to prepare and adapt to change, and to 

be able to continue functioning in a more effective and efficient 
way. 

Cities  have  proven  to  be  historically  resilient.  However,  while 
the  increasing  size  of  the  world’s  urban  population  offers 
opportunities  to  increase  efficiency  in  access  to  services, 
economic opportunities, political participation and other areas, 
it also presents new challenges associated with scattered and 
informal  settlements,  environmental  degradation,  greater 
demand  for  resources,  and  increased  inequality.  This  makes 
resilience  a  fundamental  factor  in  guaranteeing  the  quality 
of  life  in  cities.  Given  its  importance,  resilience  principles  are 
aligned with global agendas, such as the SDGs, which propose 
to eradicate poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity 
for all as part of the 2030 agenda, the NUA, the Paris Climate 
Change Agreement, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction.

5. 100 RESILIENT CITIES 
     INITIATIVE

*Based on the challenges identified under the 100RC initiative

100 Resilient Cities (100RC) – Pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation,  is  dedicated  to  helping  cities  around  the 
world  become  more  resilient  to  the  physical,  social,  and 
economic challenges that are a growing part of life in the 
21st century. The 100RC initiative supports the cities in their 
efforts to adopt and incorporate resilience into their urban 
planning  processes  by  providing  access  to  forefront  tools 
and technical assistance, as well as by channeling resources 
for action implementation. The 100RC Network receives this 
support through four mechanisms: 

1.  Financial  and  logistical  guidance  for  establishing  an 
innovative  new  position 
in  city  government—a  Chief 

Resilience Officer (CRO), who will lead the city’s resilience 
efforts; 

2. Support for a CRO to lead stakeholders in the development 
of  a  resilience-building  strategy.  This  strategy,  developed 
over  the  course  of  6  to  9  months,  will  serve  as  the  city’s 
roadmap to resilience; 

3. Access to tools, service providers, and partners from the 
private, public, and non-profit sectors who can help cities 
develop and implement their resilience strategies. Current 
partners  include  data  analysis  companies,  reinsurance 
companies, architects, energy experts, among others;  

4. Membership of the 100RC Network, through which CROs 
can  share  best  practices,  solve  problems  collectively,  and 
learn from each other and from other resilience experts.

The  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  Municipality  (MDMQ) 
has  been  part  of  this  network  since  the  first  round,  after 
being chosen from among more than 400 cities around the 
world.  The  development  of  the  Resilient  Quito  Strategy 
underscores  its  commitment  to  building  Quito’s  resilience 
and implementing concrete actions aimed at improving the 
city’s  capacity  to  adapt  and  thrive  in  the  face  of  potential 
acute  shocks  and  chronic  stresses.  The  Quito  Resilience 
Strategy  followed  the  100RC  methodology  and  program 

guidelines,  and  was  developed  through  a  participatory 
process  that  included  meetings  and  consultations  with 
a  wide  variety  of  stakeholders  from  both  the  public  and 
private  sectors,  non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs) 
and academia. The process has been enriched by the various 
perspectives, opinions, and sources of information.

The  city’s  collaboration  in  this  global  program  is  an 
opportunity  to  share  knowledge,  techniques,  and  best 
practices  in  order  to  consolidate  an  urban  vision  that 
considers resilience in its development within the context of 
a global learning community.

The  100RC  program  provides  cities  with  an  established  set  of 
methodolgies and tools that can be adapted to each local context. 
The  City  Resilience  Framework  (CRF),  developed  by  Arup  with 
support from The Rockefeller Foundation, is a tool that helps cities 
explore the strengths and weaknesses of their systems in terms of 
four  dimensions:  Health  and  Well-being,  Economy  and  Society, 
Infrastructure  and  Environment,  and  Leadership  and  Strategy. 

Each  dimension  contains  three  “drivers”  that  subdivide  into  12 
components. The CRF aims to provide a uniform analysis framework 
for all cities that are part of the 100RC Network.  The 100RC program 
uses several diagnostic tools based on the CRF in its work with cities 
to  examine  interdependencies  and  identify  where  they  need  to 
build their capacities.

5.2 QUALITIES OF RESILIENT SYSTEMS

Urban resilience qualities were defined as part of the development of the CRF .  The following qualities determine how the 
systems proposed through the actions presented in this strategy address the possible acute impacts and chronic stresses, 
including the way in which they contribute to building resilience.

1. Reflective: learning from past experiences and incorporating the 
acquired knowledge to evaluate future decisions. 

2. Robust: implementing well-designed, built, and managed systems.

3. Inclusive: prioritizing citizen participation in decision making to establish 
mechanisms for arriving at appropriate public decisions. 

4. Integrated: coordinating a wide range of systems and institutions to 
reach a goal. 

5. Resourceful: considering alternative and innovative ways for using 
resources and find solutions. 

6. Redundant: purposely creating additional capacity to keep the city’s operating 
systems going in the event of a failure or collapse. 

7. Flexible: systems capable of adapting to unforeseen changes that may 
arise in moments of risk, in critical situations, when data is lacking, or when 
new stakeholders are being included.

6. PROBLEM STATEMENT 

               RESILIENCE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

GIven that cities are the sum of several interdependent systems, 
their problems require multidimensional solutions. This is why 
building urban resilience is fundamental to achieving robust, 
sustainable and inclusive cities.

environmental degradation, lack of an efficient transportation 
system,  and  lack  of  a  diversified  economy  that  provides  job 
opportunities. These issues mainly harm the most vulnerable 
sectors of the population. 

The 2.6 million inhabitants of the DMQ are exposed to a wide 
range of acute shocks and chronic stresses. According to the 
results  from  the  tools  used  in  the  first  phase  to  produce  the 
PRA, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and economic crises are 
dominant.  However,  there  are  other,  smaller-magnitude  and 
more frequent shocks like floods or forest fires. The vulnerable 
population is concentrated in critical areas, which exacerbates 
their exposure to threats and amplifies the impact an event may 
have. 

At the same time, the city’s  functioning continues to be affected 
by  chronic  stresses.  The  most  relevant  are  social  exclusion, 

However, there are a number of factors that contribute to building 
the city’s resilience. One of these is the age demographic, which 
offers  favorable  conditions  for  the  economy.    Natural  areas 
that  are  part  of  the  urban  and  peripheral  habitat  constitute 
life support systems with wide-ranging positive effects on the 
population’s quality of life. Infrastructure projects rethink the 
approach  to  sustainable  urban  development  and  contribute 
to efficient mobility, while the city’s social structures allow the 
consolidation of containment networks and disaster response 
and  preparation  actions.  This  last  factor  also  involves  citizen 
co-responsibility plans that enhance the ability to manage and 
validate public participation development agendas.

Social, economic, and environmental issues are present 
throughout  the  DMQ.  Therefore,  the  Quito  Resilience 
Strategy should be applied in such a way that its pillars 
and actions work hand in hand. For example, the issues 
of traffic and air pollution are best addressed by applying 
various actions from all pillars. A first step in the short term 
might be to encourage citizens to use low-emission public 
transportation  and  adopt  active  mobility  mechanisms 
(e.g., public bicycles). A complementary step is to improve 
public  space  with  nature-based  solutions  that  improve 
environmental  quality  and  promote  the  use  of  public 
spaces. These improvements could include components 
that  help  increase  citizen  safety  and  foster  a  culture  of 
mass transit system use. In the long term, planning and 
developing a compact city with a wide range of uses and 
services would help to reduce the number of trips, trip 
distances,  and  dependence  on  private  vehicles  while 
boosting  the  local  economy.  Replacing  cars  with  non-
emission vehicles is an important strategy, but it is not 
realistic to expect that citizens will switch to non-emission 
vehicles or stop using cars in favor of mass transit in the 
short or medium term. Therefore, problems may continue 
to  appear  in  different  ways,  causing  other  unintended 
shocks,  which  is  why    the  actions  taken  should  be 
reviewed periodically.

The  Chakana  is  an  important  polysemic  symbol  of  several  Andean 
cultures. This geometric figure was used as a guideline for mathematical, 
philosophical,  social,  and  religious  concepts.  The  Chakana  also 
symbolizes  the  relation  of  man  to  the  cosmos,  being  the  object  of  a 
millenary cult by offering the “order” and the “measure”. This symbol 
collects the concepts behind each of the pillars of the resilience strategy 
and unifies them under a single objective: “balance”.

The Quito Resilience Strategy has been developed in collaboration with 
AECOM, the strategy partner provided by 100 Resilient Cities.

7.1  STRATEGIC APPROACH TO BUILDING A RESILIENT                               
 

CITY 

People constitute the basis of this strategy to make the DMQ 
resilient. The starting point is to create the ability to plan the 
development  of  neighborhoods,  communities,  and  the  city 
in  general  in  a  participatory  manner.  This  mechanism  aims 
to  strengthen  social  cohesion  and  promote  self-organization 
(Peterson  et  al.,  2005),  which,  in  turn,  strengthens  the  city’s 
ability to cope with, recover from, and stand stronger against 
potential  acute  shocks  and  chronic  stresses.  This  strategy 
takes into account the willingness of Quito’s residents to share 
or participate in planning and decision making; based on this 
interest,  the  proposal  seeks  to  create  an  environment  that 
builds social institutions and, in turn, the capacities associated 
with human development (Stewart, 2013). 

of  maximizing  ecosystem  services  while  decreasing  their 
demand, which is reflected in GHGs, water consumption, and 
waste. The proposal also focuses on generating environmental 
consciousness among citizens to increase the effectiveness of 
such efforts. 

Urban,  periphery,  and  rural  areas  depend  on  the  economic 
and  social  dynamics  of  their  environment.  A  decisive  part  of 
this context is mobility, one of the greatest sources of pollution 
in  the  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito.  The  search  for  zero-  or 
low-carbon alternatives, such as the Quito Metro, is crucial to 
reducing demands on the environment, and these alternatives 
contribute to the city’s sustainable development. 

In this sense, citizen participation becomes a vehicle to engage 
the strategy’s various pillars. The actions identified will facilitate 
participatory processes that should be accompanied by other 
processes focused on strengthening the ability of communities 
to organize and empower themselves. At the same time, the 
Municipality  must  strengthen  its  receptiveness  to  demands 
coming from society while furthering its own participation in 
them.

Such  infrastructure  projects  also  have  a  positive  economic 
effect. They offer opportunities to take advantage of the benefits 
of the economies of agglomeration, related to the benefits that 
companies obtain by locating near each other, and to provide 
adequate and available housing in safe areas with the necessary 
infrastructure. This helps to decrease existing risk and avoid the 
generation of new risk. By these means a compact, integrated, 
and low-emission urban growth is proposed.

Effective  environmental  conservation  and  management 
mechanisms, based on participatory processes,  are fundamental 
to building urban resilience. Resourceful management requires 
that those who benefit directly and are related to local natural 
resources get involved in the planning and management of the 
use of such resources (Ingles et al., 1999). Given the importance 
of  the  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito’s  natural  heritage, 
conservation of such areas fostering the provision of ecosystem 
services  (such  as  air  quality  improvement,  water  supply, 
temperature  regulation,  or  recreational  experiences  such  as 
scenic walks) are not only urgently needed, but also provide an 
opportunity for economic development for people living in such 
areas.

Urban  areas  have 
replaced  many  previously  existing 
ecosystems, thereby changing natural dynamics (UN Habitat, 
2015). This trend should be redirected through solutions that 
prioritize  environmental  care.  This  strategy  sets  out  the  idea 

The  proposed  urban  development  has  the  potential  to 
generate  employment  for  the  DMQ’s  human  capital.  To  fulfill 
this  potential,  productive  agendas  should  be  fostered  to 
create  decent,  high-quality  job  opportunities  and  bridge  the 
knowledge  and  skill  gaps  between  human  capital  and  the 
productive sector. Promoting innovation and entrepreneurship 
from a sustainability perspective complements this potential. 
This approach highlights proposals that contemplate an added 
value, such as circular economy or urban agriculture, as part of a 
broader understanding of the food system. Such proposals not 
only focus on economic production, but also strengthen food 
security. The goal is to create resilient economies that have the 
ability to recover from possible acute shocks and an economic 
evironment that allows for an ongoing diversification of sectors. 

Quito’s  economy  is  characterized  by  deep  inequalities.  Thus, 
one  portion  of  the  city’s  residents  have  an  exaggerated 
exposure  to  the  risks  associated  with  their  socio-economic

condition.  Building  a  safer  city  requires  planning  and  taking 
actions to reduce physical vulnerability. Decreasing risk means 
that natural and man-made threats need to be identified and 
integrated  into  local  planning.  Thus,  strengthening  urban 
development  regulations  includes  mitigating  existing  risks, 
avoiding  the  creation  of  new  risks,  and  even  considering 
relocation processes when necessary. 

Building resilience needs to be an ongoing process; therefore, 
the principles need to be embedded in the city’s planning and 
administration. Its multidimensional aspects require sustained 
analysis and follow-up with the aim to re-evaluate approaches 
and renew commitments. This multidimensional characteristic 
is  defined  by  the  ability  to  build  networks  and  interaction 
between different stakeholders, making it possible to develop 
and  reconfigure  proposals  in  an  ongoing  search  for  effective 
results.

The provision of housing in safe and adequate places helps to deconcentrate 
the risk located in the outskirts of the city and provides adequate conditions 
and services to improve the quality of life.

A  sustainable  and  resilient  transportation  system  ensures  the  efficient 
functionality  of  the  city.  At  the  same  time  it  reduces  the  demand  for 
ecosystem services.

The DMQ’s natural heritage and natural resources provide conditions of life 
support and a development opportunity for the city.

The  strengthening  of  the  social  capital  by  taking  advantage  of  the  great 
human diversity located in the urban centralities ensures that Quito residents 
can effectively face any adverse situations, through collective action.

The location of the DMQ presents a great geographical variety that offers 
diverse landscapes. At the same time it presents challenges that must be 
faced when planning and managing urban development.

| RESILIENT QUITO   7.3 HOW TO READ THE STRATEGY

The  strategy  is  constituted  of  5  pillars,  16  goals,  and  64 
actions. They are defined throughout this strategy and are the 
result of the analysis of the discovery areas established in the 
Preliminary Resilience Assessment and the activities outlined 
Scope of Work during Phase 2. 

Each  pillar  includes  a  problem  statement  and  the  current 
framework  within  which  the  strategy  has  been  developed. 
Next,    goals  for  each  pillar  are  defined  and  from  there 
actions  are  proposed.  Here,  the  platform  partners  who 
have  collaborated  on  assessment  and  technical  advice  in 
developing  each  of  the  pillars  are  identified.  The  cities  in 
the 100RC Network that have inspired the proposal are also 
identified.

Each  pillar  details  actions  or  projects  that  are  local, 
international or within the 100RC Network that have served 
as inspiration. It also describes platform partners that have 
been  building  resilience  or  have  had  a  major  influence  on 
developing goals and actions in the strategy. The discussion 
of each pillar highlights the contribution, creativity, influence, 
or  similarity  of  these  actions  or  projects  and  compares 
them  with  the  actions  of  the  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito 
Resilience Strategy. 

The  following    details    are    provided  for  each  action:  a 
description,  the  type,  status  ,  implementation  timeline,  
owners, other implementation partners, and how it relates to 
other goals of the strategy. A set of performance indicators is 
presented that makes it possible to measure implementation. 
Impact indicators, PMDOT alignment, and contribution to the 
SDGs are discussed in the appendices at the end of document.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Photo:  Francisco Galárraga

The  city’s  accelerated  and  unplanned  growth  creates 
challenges, including lack of integration and social cohesion. 
The Metropolitan District of Quito has a fragmented and weak 
social fabric, with minimal public empowerment. This is partly 
due to the poor application of social participation tools, loss of 
community ties, and low citizen initiative and commitment. 

Effective land management requires integrated and participatory 
planning  and  administrative  processes.  Strengthening  the 
social fabric and encouraging citizen participation are crucial 
factors  for  these  processes.  In  turn,  these  processes  require 
promoting  actions  that  include  stakeholder  meetings  to 
facilitate work with neighborhoods or communities, identifying 
groups of people in vulnerable situations, creating places for 
citizens to meet up and promote cohesive communities, and 
applying  public  policies  that  focus  on  reducing  existing  gaps 
(MDGQ, 2015). 

neighborhoods, however only 189 have established assemblies. 
This indicates a still-developing participatory agenda, resulting 
in a large majority of the population, which includes vulnerable 
groups, with no representation.

Citizen participation is based on the ability of communities and 
citizens  to  self-manage,  coupled  with  the  receptive  attitude 
of the city’s institutions. The Municipality of the Metropolitan 
District of Quito has been making changes to its management 
model to adopt this definition of participatory policies. These 
changes, which include tools and social programs, along with 
a closer relationship and openness with its citizens, need to be 
further reinforced. A government that has a close relationship 
with  its  citizens  needs  to  make  connections  with  key  social 
players  when  making  decisions,  and  promote  consultations 
and  participatory  mechanisms  during  the  entire  lifecycle  of 
local public policies.

Participatory  policies  must  recognize  citizen  needs  and  the 
significant  social  diversity,  while  facilitating  collaborative 
processes  in  an  inclusive  manner.  The  city  has  sufficient 
social  capital  to  build  solid  institutions  while  the  municipal 
administration  has  developed  mechanisnms  to  facilitate  the 
process.  However,  the  dynamics  that  are  key  to  an  effective 
citizen  participation  have  not  always  come  together  as 
required. The Metropolitan District of Quito has more than 2000 

Participatory democracy not only validates the work of public 
administration,  but  also  strengthens  and  provides  feedback 
on  responsiveness  and  reaction  abilities  in  the  face  of  acute 
shocks  and  chronic  stresses.  The  goal  of  promoting  citizen 
representation in local administration contributes to form an 
environment that facilitates co-responsibility between citizens 
and  the  Municipality  by  democratizing  decision  making  for 
inclusive development.

DESCRIPTION
 
Comprehensive mapping of Metropolitan District 
of Quito stakeholders is a technical process that 
involves visiting neighborhoods, communes, and 
organizations  to  identify  key  stakeholders  that 
are representative leaders. This work in the field 
makes it possible to include other stakeholders 
in  the  citizen  participation  process,  including 
communities that are excluded otherwise.

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND
 
Effective  mapping  of  community  stakeholders 
makes  it  possible  to  have  more  efficient  and 
inclusive  citizen  participation.  Effective  mapping 
also allows the municipal administration to more 
easily  identify  the  needs  of  its  citizens.  A  well-
organized and well-represented neighborhood is 
likely to transmit its needs to the corresponding 
authorities, allowing that neighborhood to receive 
better  attention,  while  improving  community 
control  of  the  territory  (Sullivan  et  al.,  2006).

Citizen participation training programs for municipal employees

DESCRIPTION
 
This  program 
is  coordinated  with  training 
sessions for municipal employees in relation to 
citizen participation mechanisms as established 
in  the  ordinances  that  provide  the  rules  for 
participatory  processes 
in  the  Metropolitan 
District  of  Quito.  The  target  is  to  promote  and 
foster  these  methods 
in  the  Municipality’s 
activities that involve relationships with citizens, 
including:
- Curriculum design and delivery method
- Delivery of training courses 

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND
 
Training  municipal  employees  based  on 
existing  mechanisms  seeks  to  promote  citizen 
participation  processes  and  to  put  them  into 
practice  within  the  municipal  administration. 
Facilitation  and  proper 
implementation  of 
existing tools has a great effect on the results of 
participation  processes,  while  strengthening  the 
municipality’s image and ensuring the continuity 
of  policies,  programs  and  projects  over  time 
and  across  future  administrations  (Cousins  and 
Whitmore, 1998).

*  The  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito’s  citizen 
participation  platform  is  being  developed 
thanks  to  the  support  of  the  Madrid  City 
Council,  which  has  been  in  the  process  of 
implementation  since  the  middle  of  2017 
using  transfer  of  knowledge.  The  DMQ 
platform  is  based  on  the  CONSUL  platform, 
which is linked to its web domain: 
www.decidemadrid.es.

Digital citizen participation platform

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND
 
This  type  of  tool  not  only  helps  to  spark  the 
interest  of  people  who  are  not  usually  actively 
involved in public interest matters, but also gets 
them to take action, thus contributing to a better 
understanding  of  accessible  and  transparent 
information.  The  platform  works  to  diversify 
participants and public discussion. If democratic 
participation has been seen as the closest thing 
to direct democracy (Hague Loader. Eds. 1999), 
then digital participation is the way to achieve it.

DESCRIPTION 

Today’s  digital  age  dictates  public  institutions 
to  create  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  way  they 
develop  public  policies  and  requires  the  active 
participation of citizens.  A digital platform seeks 
to  facilitate  this  process  by  channeling  digital 
citizen participation to support traditional face-to-
face participation and focusing on implementing 
different  decision-making  mechanisms,  such 
as  participatory  budgets  or  “empty-chair”,  as  a 
place  at  the  city  council  to  discuss  policies,  or 
other  citizen  advocacy  strategies  like  advisory 
committees  or  public  hearings.  The  platform’s 
main  contributions  are:  (1)  Access  to  relevant 
information; (2) Free expression and exchange of 
opinions;  (3)  Fostering  training  of  social  capital; 
(4) Automation of citizen participation processes; 
and (5) Youth involvement in public decisions. *

agendas  are  designed 
through  workshops 
held  with  the  community  and  neighborhood

Put participatory budget processes into practice

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND
 
Participatory budgets are a useful mechanism for 
efficient investment in projects and services that 
address  the  community’s  needs.  There  is  also 
a  clear  system  for  involving  the  community  in 
planning for its own development, thus promoting 
citizen empowerment (Cabannes, 2004).

DESCRIPTION
 
The  participatory  budget  mechanism,  which  is 
used for citizens to contribute and be decide on 
a certain percentage of the municipal budget, is 
a key tool that the Metropolitan District of Quito 
Municipality  has  been  promoting.  It  will  be 
reinforced by adding dissemination mechanisms 
and others to facilitate  legal instruments required 
for  its  regulation.  Easily  accessible  digital  tools 
will  be  proposed  accordingly.  The  goal  behind 
these changes is for the participation method to 
become more inclusive, efficient, and effective so 
that it can reach a larger portion of the population. 
At  the  same  time,  the  idea  is  for  investment  to 
focus  on  projects  that  contribute  to  the  social, 
environmental,  and  economic  development 
agenda of neighborhoods and the whole city.

International Benchmark: Decide Madrid

The  “Decide  Madrid”  website,  launched  in  September  2015  by  the  Madrid  City 
Council, is a place where Madrid residents can decide on their city’s policies. The 
website works through four participatory phases:

Debates: In this phase, citizens can propose a topic or weigh in on a debate using 
agree or disagree buttons. 

Proposals: In this phase, citizens can create proposals to improve their quality of 
life. The proposals can be validated by other Madrid residents. Once they receive 
1% support from Madrid’s registered voters, the proposals are moved to the debate 
section. Finally, the proposal passes on to the voting section. If it receives more 
votes in favor than against, the City Council adopts it and begins implementation.

Participatory budgets: Registered Madrid voters also have the option of creating 
a spending bill. If the proposal is accepted, it is placed into the support phase to 
prioritize the most interesting options. The City Council evaluates the feasibility and 
cost of the proposals that received the most support. 

Voting: In the voting phase, citizens decide on how the available budget will be 
spent. Votes are taken on the different proposals that have gained support in the 
previous phases. 

In addition to simplifying and expanding the City Council’s participatory processes, 
this website provides information on projects that are already being implemented.

Lack of citizen knowledge about the existence and

focuses  on  areas  facing  social  safety  problems 
by  recovering  and/or  building  public  places 
through  a  participatory  planning  and  design 
process. By providing services and infrastructure 
that  are  agreed  upon  by  the  community, 
functional  and  useful  areas  are  created.  The 
program has had positive results around the city. 
Currently, four pilot projects have been planned 
in  Conocoto,  Calderón,  Nueva  Aurora,  and 
Tumbaco. The action strengthens this project by

About  60  percent  of  the  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  is 
covered by natural vegetation. These areas are characterized 
by  a  diverse  topography  and  a  variety  of  climates;  they 
consist of 120,000 hectares (ha) of rainforests in the western 
part, 47,000 ha of bushes and dry forests in the Guayllabamba 
basin; 45,000 ha of gorges and intervened areas, and 45,000 
ha of paramo (andean moor) which appear at 3,600 meters 
(m) above sea level (Environment Department, 2016). This 
natural heritage is the city’s backbone, and its future seems 
prosperous  given  that  close  to  40  percent  of  the  territory 
is protected by a variety of legal instruments to safeguard 
its high environmental value. There is urgency to properly 
manage  this  natural  heritage,  based  on  the  relation 
communities - natural areas, becomes a critical need since 
our quality of life depends on that.

The  city’s  agricultural  production  systems,  which  take  up 
119,366  ha  (28.2  percent  of  the  area  of  the  metropolitan 
district) produce a wide variety of products, including food, 
flowers, commercial forests, and aquaculture (Environment 
Department, 2016). While the Metropolitan District of Quito’s 

rich ecosystems significantly contribute to the city’s habitat 
and economic production, ecological management should 
focus  on  reducing  the  pressure  affecting  them.  However, 
above all, actions should be focused on avoiding the loss of 
these areas and their biodiversity, as they provide important 
services  such  as  water,  air,  and  carbon  sequestration 
capacity,  to  name  a  few.  Valuing  ecosystem  services 
allows  us  to  not  only  obtain  resources  but  also  propose 
participatory mechanisms for managing and administering 
such areas. 

At the urban level, environmental degradation and physical 
vulnerability  are  underlying  problems.  When  the  city’s 
planning and design take nature and its benefits into account, 
it is possible to find solutions with positive outcomes. One 
clear advantage of nature’s presence in cities is air pollution 
reduction; improved air quality also contributes to reducing 
urban  heat  island  effect  and  creates  micro-climates  that 
encourage prolonged use of public areas (TNC, 2016). If they 
are correctly implemented, nature-based solutions can also 
help improve conditions involving physical vulnerabilities,

Local Belnchmark: Atacazo - FONAG 

Water  conservation  and  supply  is  vital  to  a  resilient  city.  The  FONAG  trust 
was created in 2000 to guarantee sufficient quantity and quality of water for 
Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  residents  using  resources  from  Metropolitan 
Public Authority of Drinking Water and Sanitation (EPMAPS) and other public 
and private stakeholders. FONAG executes, finances, and co-finances processes 
that contribute to protecting, conserving, maintaining, and recovering the city’s 
water sources.

Important progress has been made in working with communities to conserve 
and  maintain  strategic  areas  inside  of  the  Metropolitan  District.  The  Atacazo 
initiative is coordinated with TNC, and fosters activities such as aiding members 

of the community with the gradual replacement of 400 sheep with alpacas.  This 
project is helping achieve lower environmental impact from economic activities 
in  the  area,  while  maintaining  or  even  increasing  the  revenue  for  families 
generated from selling sheep wool.

The project includes socialization, training, and ongoing collaboration so that 
changes to productive activities are successful and the community members 
can  become  protection  and  recovery  agents  of  the  area.  The  results  of  this 
process are already evident: topsoil and native plant growth are  recovering, 
thus protecting the city’s water sources.

and place them into categories as either supply (food, 
water,  wood,  fibers,  fuel),  climate  regulation  (flood 
control,  heat  reduction,  water  supply)  or  cultural 
(recreation, aesthetics, religion, education). Collecting 
new data and systematizing existing data on natural 
assets  facilitates  a  cost-benefit  analysis  to  evaluate 
the social suitability of environmental projects. Data 
collection and systematization also foster the ability 
to create policies and programs with environmental

Inspiration from the 100RC 
network:  Atlanta BeltLine

The  Atlanta  BeltLine  is  a  sustainable  re-urbanization  project  that  connects  45 
Atlanta  neighborhoods  using  a  circuit  of  pedestrian  trails,  trollies,  and  parks 
along old city railroad lines. This infrastructure belt has increased environmental 
awareness in a city known for its suburban expansion and points to several lessons 
learned on urban revival.

The Atlanta BeltLine not only provides a modern and sustainable transportation 
system,  but  also  supports  affordable  housing,  local  economic  development, 
job creation, public health, urban art, and environmental renewal, all related to 
sustainability.

Green infrastructure and local ecosystem recovery are keys to the system’s success. 
Insertion of native species has had a positive impact on the increase in biodiversity, 
and  nature-based  solutions  for  rainwater  collection  and  treatment  have  saved 
money to the city. Since the city faces chronic droughts, using this same strategy, 
an abandoned quarry next to one of the trails will be turned into a park-reservoir 
that will provide 30 days of water supply for the city, as opposed to Atlanta’s current 
three-day reserve.

The Atlanta BeltLine has changed the lifestyle and transportation habits of many 
Atlanta residents in areas that were completely abandoned and polluted nine years 
ago.

Photo: Miguel Páez, Drones Creativity EC

The  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  has  experienced 
scattered  and  unplanned  growth  since  the  1970s.  This 
phenomenon,  in  some  cases  resulting  from  unregulated 
land  use,  has  resulted  in  approximately  180,000  people 
(about 7 percent of the population) living in unregulated 
communities as of 2014 (MDGM, 2015). The pace at which 
these settlements are occurring exceeds the city’s ability to 
plan its urban development and has caused expansion of 
the urban footprint beyond the initial model of a “compact 
central  city”  into  an  expansive  and  uncoordinated  city. 
Today, the Metropolitan District of Quito has a low-density 
structure that is scattered, segregated, not very compact, 
and  dysfunctional  (MDMQ,  2015).  Thus,  homes  are  in 
places  that  are  increasingly  far  from  the  central  city,  but 
employment  and  services  are  still  mainly  concentrated 
(54 percent) in the main central area (8 out of the 65 DMQ 
parish centers) (City Institute, 2015).

This situation leads to serious problems involving mobility, 
accessibility,  and  the  provision  of  services,  all  of  which 
affect  the  city’s  efficient  functioning  and,  therefore,  the 
quality of life for Quito residents. Controlling this growth, 
and  planning  an  appropriate  type  of  development  is 
an 
important  alternative  available  to  reduce  social 
and  land  inequality.  A  well-planned  and  managed  land 

results  in  sustainable  and  efficient  urban,  social,  and 
productive growth leading to appropriate population and 
economic  distribution  (MDMQ,  2015).  Planning  for  this 
type  of  development  should  include  areas  with  greater 
density,  urban  quality,  and  safety.  The  plan  should  also 
provide for greater diversity in land use. The objective is 
to  leverage  the  vitality  generated  by  an  integrated  mass 
transportation  system  while  also  promoting  alternatives 
such as walking and bicycling (The World Bank, 2013), and 
providing an incentive to the real estate market around the 
transportation system to support the city’s progress.

According  to  the  city’s  Environmental  Department, 
transportation  generates  the  greatest  amount  of  CO2 
emissions  (56  percent)  in  the  city  (2,902,402  tons  of  CO2 
per  year)  (2016),  and  its  operation  affects  both  urban 
environmental conditions and the health of Quito residents.  
For this reason the city requires mobility alternatives that 
contribute to reducing the carbon footprint and improving 
environmental  quality,  while  coping  with  the  possible 
effects of climate change and other natural hazards. The 
first Quito Metro line, as the main spine of the city’s mobility 
system, enables the generation of environmentally friendly 
alternatives  that  contribute  to  sustainable  development 
and build resilience towards the year 2040.

Comprehensive Project Rehabitar la Montaña: 
Anticipating the informal growth on the slopes of 
Medellín

Rehabitar  la  Montaña  is  a  proposed  project  that  was  developed  by  the  EAFIT 
University  in  Medellín  and  Leibniz  University  of  Hannover,  together  with  the 
Mayor’s  Office of Medellín, to provide alternatives to urban problems derived from 
informal settlements on the slopes of Medellín. Settlements in thse areas are more 
vulnerable to natural disasters, like landslides and floods, and also deteriorate the 
environment due to unplanned and uncontrolled expansion of urban sprawl. The 
initiative focuses on two strategies: (1) anticipating settlements and (2) mitigating 
existing risk.

The  anticipation  strategy  consists  of  analyzing  the  land  to  identify  areas  that 
are inclined to be occupied by informal settlements. This effort is then followed 
by  settlement  discouragement  through  environmental  restoration,  sustainable 
forestry,  nature  trails,  parks,  or  urban  agriculture  in  the  identified  areas.  It  also 
redirects growth to areas that are more appropriate for human settlements. This 
redirection is done by providing facilities, public utilities, public parks, etc., to make 
the areas more attractive.

The mitigation strategy focuses on actions that reduce risk and improve the quality 
of  life  in  communities  that  are  already  occupying  hillside  slopes.  This  strategy 
involves  slope  stabilization  using  bio-engineering,  sustainable  water  and  solid 
waste management, and resettlement of high-risk dwellings.

The project uses a community model in which citizen participation is key for its 
success.  Social  involvement  includes  communication,  training,  and  awareness 
programs for the communities to become allies and co-manage the areas where 
they live.

International Benchmark: El Pedregal, TOD in Bogotá

The Transmilenio transportation system was implemented in Bogotá in the year 
2000, and today it is one of the world’s top bus rapid transit (BRT) systems. With 
110 kilometers (km) of exclusive lanes, 138 stops, nine terminals, and a fleet of 2,207 
buses, the system transports more than 2.4 million passengers per day, making it 
the most used BRT in the world. In Bogotá, public transportation accounts for 41 
percent of all daily trips made.

El Pedregal is a BRT station located where two major city roads cross: Seventh 
Avenue,  the  most  important  street  in  Bogotá,  with  stores,  institutions,  and 
universities,  and  100th  Street,  which  connects  the  city  business  center  to  the 
western part of the city and the airport. There are plans to expand the Transmilenio 
to include BRT lanes on both streets, thus increasing public transportation arrivals 
at the station. The Bogotá Land Use Plan identified El Pedregal as a possible site 
for urban revival because of its location next to the city’s financial center, its low 
population density, and its small number of landowners.

The planning agency has established that development will follow a SAP (Small 
Area Plan),  which is the legal concept used to design districts or neighborhoods 
as either new developments or renovation projects. The SAP can be promoted 
by  the  public  or  private  sector,  provided  that  a  successful  public  consultation 
process is carried out before the plan’s approval. By law, a SAP must meet certain 
requirements essential to urban design. For example, at least 17 percent of the plan 
area needs to be set aside for public use. To increase population density and take 
advantage of available space, the developer is required to either pay for or provide 
public assets like roads, schools, or, in this case, a public transit station.

The  El  Pedregal  Partial  Plan  was  adopted  in  2015.  Aldea  Proyectos,  a  private 
company with experience on similar projects in Bogotá, was chosen to manage 
the development project. Commercial towers and a transit hub are already under 
construction, and the estimated completion date for the project is 2020. The city 
anticipates that this initiative will consolidate the commercial aspect of the area 
and provide a solution to traffic problems existing in the northern part of the city.

Mobility not only affects social issues, but is also 
related to the city’s efficiency and productivity. To 
this effect, the model begins with an analysis and 
serves as a guide in creating a proposal for a well-

systems (Shiftan et al., 2003).  

DESCRIPTION 

This study proposes to prepare a city model with a 
development policy that focuses on resilience and 
sustainability.  It  proposes  a  system  to  evaluate 
and  integrate  different  means  of  transportation 
and a series of measures to make trips within the 
city more efficient and with fewer environmental 
impacts.  Specifically,  this  study  proposes  an 
analysis and recommendations based on energy 
efficiency  and  a  smaller  ecological  footprint.  It 
also incorporates the qualities of resilient systems 
and  involves  adaptation  to  and  mitigation  of 
climate  change.  These  variables  will  be  part  of 
an  evaluation  tool  that  will  be  used  in  making 
decisions  and  creating  contingency  plans  for 
identified  natural  and  human  induced  threats. 
Such  plans  need  to  be  coordinated  with  other

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND
 
A walkable city is increasingly valued for a variety 
of reasons: pedestrian mobility not only reduces 
congestion  and  has  low  environmental  impact, 
but also has social and recreational value. Recent 
studies  suggest  that  walking  promotes  mental 
and physical health. Urban environment quality is 
key to encouraging people to choose walking over 
driving (Southworth, 2005).

This  action  proposes  to  launch  a  contest  with 
proposals  to  improve  pedestrian  and  bicycle 
routes  with  better  conditions  in-terms  of  space 
and  safety  in  public  areas.  Such  strategies  are 
necessary  in  a  city  where  public  areas  have 
adapted  to  unplanned  growth  in  a  city  with 
a  challenging  topography.  This  contest  seeks 
solutions  to  complement  municipal  efforts  to

Program to encourage the use of public and private bicycles

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND

Promoting  a  change  of  the  transportation 
culture  in  the  city  requires  a  major  effort  that 
demands  support  from  private  stakeholders 
who  could  offer  incentives  for  bicycle  use. 
This  change  would  receive  the  support  of 
urban  cyclist  groups  and  organizations  that 
seek  to  encourage  bicycle  use  by  the  general 
public. This action reduces vehicle congestion, 
improves air quality, activates the use of public 
areas,  and  therefore,  has  a  significant  impact 
on the health of city residents (Litman, 2004).

DESCRIPTION
 
The  use  of  bicycles  will  be  promoted  through 
public-private  partnerships  in  which  users  of 
this means of transport receive various benefits 
from  sponsoring  companies  (e.g.,  access  to 
promotional  products)  or  their  employers.  The 
Municipality  provides  areas  for  advertisement, 
infrastructure, and bicycle parking lots; develops 
and  coordinates  the  program;  and  provides 
conditions  to  encourage  bicycle  use.  The 
maintenance  of  bicycle  lanes,  signage,  road 
education, and strengthening the public bicycle 
program that already operates in the city are all 
important tasks to encourage the use of private 
bicycles.

  STRATEGY| PILLAR D| RESILIENT QUITO PROBLEM STATEMENT

In  socioeconomic  terms,  demographic  distribution 
is 
one  of  Quito’s  most  important  characteristics:  half  of  the 
population  is  under  29  years  old.  When  analyzing  this  we 
found that one out of four inhabitants is between age 30 and 
49 (27 percent), and a similar number (28 percent) is between 
age  15  and  29,  making  these  two  the  most  prevalent  age 
cohorts, alongside that of children and adolescents under 
the  age  of  14  (27  percent)  (PMDOT  2015-2025  (I),  MDMQ). 
This situation is particularly important in the construction 
of long-term resilience, since the population’s age structure 
is expected to change in the coming decades (a reduction in 
the number of children and an increase in older adults). This 
change will mean a smaller working population contributing 
to production, with increased pressure on the social security 
system for the elderly.

Although the Metropolitan District of Quito is prosperous, it 
is at the same time sensitive to external economic factors 
such  as  the  price  of  oil.  The  DMQ  produces  23  percent  of 
the  national  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  the  highest 
of  any  city  in  Ecuador  (MDMQ,  2015).  However,  it  is  a  city 
where  wealth  is  concentrated.  In  the  Metropolitan  District 
of  Quito,  there  are  101,937  economic  establishments 
(according  to  the  2010  Economic  Census),  most  of  which 
are  microenterprises  (89  percent).  These  establishments 
account  for  2.3  percent  of  total  sales  and  36  percent  of 
employment. Though only 1 percent of businesses are large 
companies, they represent 88.2 percent of sales and employ 
32 percent of the workforce (MDMQ, 2015). Efforts to achieve 
greater inclusion of the population are affected by the gap 
between the available human capital and the needs of the 
productive  sector.  Knowledge  about  these  aspects  makes 

it possible to develop mechanisms to prepare the potential 
workforce.

Even though Quito is the city with the highest concentration 
of  technology  in  the  country,  its  investment  in  business 
innovation and research is incredibly low compared to other 
Latin  American  cities.  Of  the  total  number  of  companies, 
only 1.1 percent invest in research and development, and 
this  investment  is  concentrated  in  the  large  companies 
(PMDOT  2015-2025  (ii),  MDMQ).  From  this  perspective, 
programs  that  promote  sustainability  principles  should 
encourage investment in innovation to increase economic 
diversity  in  the  productive  sector.  These  programs  could 
also  take  advantage  of  the  entrepreneurial  vocation  of 
Quito,  evidenced  by  the  31,812  establishments  created 
in 2009 and 2010, 55 percent of which report sales of less 
than  $USD  9,999  per  year  (according  to  Economic  Census 
2010, quoted in MDMQ 2015). The goal is to foster and allow 
ongoing  commercial  diversification  with  an  inclusion  and 
environmental sustainability focus. 

Looking  through  the  lens  of  inclusion,  a  clear  example  of 
economic diversification is found in efforts that have been 
made  by  the  Municipality  to  develop  the  Urban  Farming 
Program. However, the city produces only 5 percent of its 
food requirement, and its food system is highly vulnerable to 
weather and seismic and volcanic events (RUAF, 2017). Thus, 
support for programs like the Urban Vegetable Gardens and 
the  development  of  the  food  economy  not  only  makes  it 
possible to give  boost  vulnerable socio-economic sectors, 
but also works toward achieving food security.

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND

The  action  begins  by  identifying  the  potential 
of the city’s diverse productive sectors using an 
inclusive  development  approach.  This  action 
creates  a  multifactor  evaluation  methodology 
that contributes to creating quality employment, 
sustainability,  and  attractiveness  for  investors. 
The  action  creates  a  tool  that  can  be  used 
on  a  continuous  basis  to  keep  improving  the 
method.  Identifying  productive  sectors  helps  to 
strategically strengthen the labor supply.

Economic resilience must necessarily be built on 
sustained  economic  growth  (Caldera  Sanchez, 
2017).  Allowing  sectors  to  become  stronger  is 
a  useful  mechanism  to  consolidate  economic 
development  processes.  This  process  makes 
it  possible  to  integrate  different  sectors  and 
stakeholders  in  the  city’s  agenda  to  raise  its 
competitiveness. Participants in the process might 
include  other  sectors  such  as  academia;  which 
would result in the inclusion of a diversity of actors 
that operate within the city’s informal economy.

This action, which performs a study on gaps in 
abilities  in  the  city’s  socio-economic  context, 
provides  the  information  needed  to  undertake 
dialogue  between  the  private  sector  and  the 
Municipality. Once the job market (the production 
sectors offering quality job opportunities) and the 
possible  workforce  (human  capital)  have  been 
characterized, new strategies can be proposed to 
build abilities, migrate laborers form one sector 
to another with better opportunities, or promote 
training  for  new  abilities  to  take  advantage  of 
both the supply and the demand of labor.

A  comprehensive  human  capital  plan  aids  in 
strategically  formulating  public  policies  (The 
World  Economic  Forum,  2016).  Calculating  the 
gap between human capital and the job market 
in the different parts of production sectors ends 
up strategically building up the former, turning 
it into the production factor needed to enhance 
the local economy (UN Habitat, 2015) and reduce 
socioeconomic vulnerability. This effort makes it 
possible to take informed and effective action to 
facilitate the involvement of other stakeholders,

Inspiration from the 100RC network: 
Promotion of circular economy in Rio de 
Janeiro

Today, consumption and production patterns follow a linear model of extraction, 
use, and elimination. On the one hand, we have greater demand for raw materials, 
leading to associated environmental impacts. On the other hand, more and more 
waste is being generated, and with that issues related to its transportation and 
disposal arise. To counter this issue, Rio de Janeiro, as part of its resilience strategy, 
has proposed “promoting an inclusive, diversified, low-carbon circular economy,” 
with two main initiatives: (1) create an agency to promote a circular economy in the 
city and (2) give value to solid and organic waste. These actions seek to empower 
citizens through job creation and support the city’s efforts to mitigate and adapt to 
the effects of climate change.
 
There are three main objectives behind creating a municipal agency for this project: 
(1) to reduce waste sent to landfills, (2) to create jobs by giving value to waste, and 

(3) to foster efficient use of resources to create a circular economic model. In a 
circular economy products are developed taking into consideration their useful life, 
reuse, recycling, and transformation of the materials so that “business ecosystems” 
can be developed. In this ecosystems the waste generated by one industry is used 
as raw materials by another.
 
By assigning value to solid waste, civil society becomes more involved in the circular 
economy, with the agency’s support. Mini-recycling and composting centers are 
created as gathering points, giving value to and exchanging solid and organic waste. 
These  centers  will  not  only  provide  materials,  but  they  will  also  make  possible 
organic waste composting, which can be used by residents and distributed to local 
urban gardens.

DESCRIPTION 

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND

Food  policy  will  be  of  great  importance  to 
economic  development  efforts  over  the  coming 
decades  (Timmer  and  Pearson,  1985).  Food 
challenges  must  be  adequately  analyzed  to  be 
solved.  This  type  of  analysis  is  a  complex  task 
that entails having a long-term vision on how the 
food system can evolve and become a social and 
economic asset for the city. To the extent that the 
food system becomes an asset, it not only helps 
to  strengthen  Quito’s  socio-economic  fabric,  but 
also contributes to the city’s development efforts 
by supporting a healthy population and making 
it less vulnerable to possible acute shocks (RUAF, 
2017).

resources 

The Quito food system is the set of stakeholders, 
processes,  and 
that  contributes 
to  providing  food  to  the  city.  Some  of  the 
characteristics  of  the  food  system  increase  its 
vulnerability;  among  these  are  its  dependency 
on the imported food (approximately 85 percent 
of food is imported), weak distribution systems, 
and  isolated  communities.  After  analysis  of  its 
different  components,  including  vulnerabilities, 
threats, strengths, and potential, an action plan 
is  proposed  to  influence  the  final  availability 
and  accessibility  of  varied  and  nutritious  food 
products.  This  action  also  seeks  to  influence 
consumers’  ability  to  choose  healthy  diets  by 
providing nutrition and health education through 
policies, incentives, and appropriate governance.

mechanism,  this  action  helps  to  improve  living 
conditions,  especially  in  terms  of  inclusion  and 
social  protection  of  the  vulnerable  population 
(RUAF,  2017).  This  project  also  contributes  to 
resilience  and  food  security  by  strengthening 
existing  production  systems

from a characteristic that is unique to the ancient 
Ecuadorian Andean population and its connection 
to  agriculture.  The  action  proposes  to  strengthen 
the  food  supply  grown  in  the  city,  implementing 
mechanisms to improve both the quantity and the 
quality  of  production  in  urban  gardens  as  well  as 
the demand for such products. This action involves 
providing  mechanisms  for  large  possible  markets, 
such  as  the  services  sector,  while  maintaining 
product availability at local markets.

Local benchmark: AGRUPAR

The Participative Urban Agriculture Project (AGRUPAR), which was developed by the 
Metropolitan District of Quito in 2002, fosters self-production of food by making use 
of empty public and private lots as a strategy to reduce food insecurity. This initiative 
facilitates improvement in the access, availability and quality of the food consumed, and 
makes food an important source of income and savings for its participants. It is currently 
applied  as  a  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  sustainability  indicator,  and  its  practice 
contributes to reducing food system vulnerability.

AGRUPAR promotes organic production based on agricultural ecology, small species 
breeding  ,  direct  sale  of  production  surpluses,  economic  and  social  inclusion  of 
vulnerable sectors, and promotion of responsible consumption, with emphasis on local, 
fresh, diversified, healthy, and nutritious food. 

The  project  provides  training  and  follow-up  assistance  for  agriculture  and  food 
processing for approximately 1,300 gardens (domestic gardens, community centers, and 
schools and with services for disabled people, children under 5 years old, senior citizens, 
refugees, immigrants, and other groups), where 84 percent of participants are women. 
AGRUPAR has 17 weekly bio-markets for direct sale of production surpluses, where over 
105 types of crops are sold, generating revenue of $USD 300,200 (in 2016, the bio-market 
represented 25 percent of the farm’s total sales). It has been estimated that 47 percent of 
production is sold and 53 percent is consumed by the cultivators. The project is found in 
97 percent of urban parishes and 91 percent of rural parishes, occupying more than 30 ha.

  STRATEGY| PILLAR E| RESILIENT QUITO PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Quito, tucked within the slopes of Mount Pichincha on top of 
several geological faults, is continually threatened by at least 
five types of acute shocks: landslides, intense rainfall, volcanic 
eruptions, seismic movements, and forest fires (by natural or 
man-made  causes)  (Atlas  of  Threats,  2015).  Quito’s  location, 
its  high  level  of  exposure  to  these  threats  and  physical  and 
socioeconomic vulnerabilities, create concentrated risk zones 
throughout the territory. A series of legal instruments  contained 
within a broad legal framework for risk management in Ecuador 
-at the national level-, or the Metropolitan Ordinance that creates 
the Metropolitan System of Comprehensive Risk Management 
for  the  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  -at  the  local  level-, 
establish preventative actions and regulations for the various 
levels of government in the event of a disaster, depending on its 
magnitude. However, these regulations must be accompanied 
by clear prevention and risk reduction mechanisms. With this 
aim, the Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito needs 
to incorporate the scope of risk in its planning and territorial 
management. Likewise, it is important for the city to motivate 
and prepare its citizens to become involved in efforts to prevent 
and reduce vulnerabilities.

No  study  accurately  shows  or  quantifies  the  number  of 
informal  structures.  However,  according  to  statements  by 
various  municipal  technicians,  approximately  60  percent  of 
construction  in  the  Metropolitan  District  is  informal  (MDMQ, 
2015). The sheer size of the territory and the limited ability to 
provide control make it difficult to stop this trend, as does the 
lack of enforcement of specific building regulations for the DMQ. 
The seismic threat and the particular types of soils found in the 
city makes this issue one of the city’s greatest weaknesses. The 
lack of a compliance culture worsens this problem. This situation 
results from a set of factors related to poverty, migration, and 
lack of accessible information and affordable technical advising 
services  for  low-income  families.  The  Municipality’s  efforts  to 
recognize large informal settlements (MDMQ, 2015) should be 
complemented by a detailed analysis of the physical status of 
the buildings and the land itself to modify, reinforce, or relocate 
settlements in protected and high-risk areas or places without 
proper infrastructure (MDMQ, 2015). 

Likewise, properly preparing for threats makes it possible for the 
population to recover faster after being affected by a disaster. 
To this end, it is important to ensure effective neighborhood 
organization and enhance the natural desire of Quito residents 
to help each other out. Efforts to avoid new risks and reduce 
existing ones make it possible to transfer risk through insurance 
on existing buildings at an affordable cost. This approach will 
make  financial  resources  available  to  achieve  effective  and 
inclusive recovery when needed.

| 96 |

¹   Informality in land occupation is a phenomenon triggered by several factors, 
such as lack of land ownership titles, lack of building permits, and occupation 
of areas not anticipated to be used for development.

a mechanism for visualization of the distribution of risk 
in  the  territory  was  developed  to  make  strategic  and 
informed decisions for disaster risk reduction.

Risk assessment through the application of appropriate 
methods of comparison is a complicated task, especially 
when analyzing a city with multiple threats of different 
intensities  and  periodicity,  and  with  a  heterogeneous 
distributed  vulnerable  population.  By  formulating  an

DESCRIPTION 

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND

In  a  city  where  risk  varies  and  is  not  evenly 
distributed,  information  must  be  available  to 
evaluate the most vulnerable and most exposed 
areas  so  that  actions  can  be  prioritized.  This 
action  creates  an  algorithm  to  visualize  the 
distribution  of  risk  throughout  the  territory, 
using  the  following  formula:  threat  x  exposure 
x  vulnerability  /  responsiveness.  This  program 
also  strengthens  the  SIM  and  makes  it  a  risk 
management resource for public administration. 
This open-access platform is also available to the 
general public, civil society, and the academia.

The components are:
-Complement the pool of metropolitan indicators
-Complement municipal geographic information
-Centralize strategic information

Urban development planning must prioritize and 
effectively manage actions in the land especially 
when the risk is distributed heterogeneously due 
to physical and socio-economic factors (Rygel et 
al., 2006). This action strengthens the coordination 
between different parts of the municipality; allows 
for  efficient  use  of  financial,  time,  and  human 
resources;  and  ensures  effective  management, 
especially  when  it  is  necessary  to  differentiate 
risks based on the type of event: (1) intensive risk 
(low  recurrence  but  very  high  magnitude  and 
intensity (e.g., earthquakes or volcanic eruptions) 
and  (2)  extensive  risk  (i.e.,  high  recurrence  but 
low  magnitude  and  intensity  (e.g.,  landslides  or 
floods). The two types of risk should be planned 
to  be  mitigated,  and  managed  accordingly, 
prioritizing attention on the vulnerable sectors of 
society.

DESCRIPTION
 
By  requiring  a  multisectoral  approach,  planning  to 
build resilience while taking into account risk requires 
coordination with the various stakeholders that make 
up the Municipality. The proposal aims to strengthen 
coordination for such efforts and the capacities of the 
various agencies and institutions during the planning, 
execution, and evaluation phases of risk policies. The 
Manual  of  the  Emergency  Operations  Committee 
and Metropolitan Ordinance 265 set out a program 
focused on the following topics:

• 

• 

Risk  training  for  municipal  technicians  from 
different       departments 
Strengthening

According  to  a  study,  development  of  abilities 
is  defined  as  being  the  process  of  developing 
skills,  instincts,  processes,  and  resources  that 
organizations  and  communities  need  to  adapt, 
manage, and reduce disaster-derived risks (World 
Bank, 2016). Failure to comply with construction 
standards in the city’s housing increases people’s 
vulnerability to acute shocks such as earthquakes, 
landslides, or volcanic eruptions and exacerbates 
existing  chronic  stresses.  This  action  generates 
a  culture  of  regulatory  compliance  in  the  city, 
encourages  a  close 
relationship  between 
residents  and  the  municipality,  and  encourages 
citizen participation as an agent of change.

Strengthening regulations on universal accessibility

DESCRIPTION
 
The  first  step  to  improving  accessibility  and 
inclusion  around  construction  projects  is  to 
strengthen  building  codes.  Their 
integration 
and compliance is then ensured throughout the 
regulatory process. The action proposes revising 
and  reinforcing  the  regulations  on  universal 
accessibility and spatial inclusion with no design 
barriers.

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND
 
Factors that negatively affect social inclusion, such 
as  buildings  without  universal  access  should  be 
reversed  (Emerson  et  al.,  2009).  Regulations  for 
buildings are important to developing an inclusive 
society. To this effect, this action seeks to facilitate 
accessibility  for  people  with  physical,  sensory, 
or cognitive disabilities. This action also ensures 
greater possibilities to deal with acute shocks from

the city makes it possible to direct efforts to reduce 
physical  vulnerability,  strengthen  structures, 
and assess the applicability of relocating certain 
families.  This  program  also  opens  the  door  to 
alternative markets in the construction sector in 
structural reinforcement.

The  survival  of  buildings  alone  does  not 
guarantee  a  functioning  city.  Urban  service 
systems, such as hospitals, schools, or water and 
electricity supply systems, are key to protecting 
the  population.  Achieving 
interdependence 
requires a unified approach (for example, analysis 
of the metro system’s impact on factors such as 
the water or communications systems) to ensure 
the adequacy and continuity of the DMQ’s public 
service  system.  The  action  includes  training 
technicians  and  practitioners  on  evaluation 
tools  developed  by  UNISDR  and  UN-Habitat, 
such  as  the  “Ten  Essentials”  and  the  “Disaster 
Resilience Decision Making Scorecard for Cities.”

Strengthening existing structures before a disaster 
affects human safety and aids in the rapid repair 
of existing unsafe buildings. This practice, in turn, 
makes it possible for displaced people to return to 
their homes after an extreme impact (Build Change 
and  Swisscontact,  2015).  Participative  structural 
reinforcement is a preventive action based on best 
practices. By involving different stakeholders in the 
real estate industry, more assistance is available, 
along with community collaboration.

100RC PLATFORM PARTNER: BUILD 
CHANGE LATIN AMERICA

Build Change, one of the 100RC Network platform partners, is an organization whose 
mission  focuses  on  saving  lives  in  developing  countries  during  earthquakes  and 
typhoons by reinforcing homes or schools that are in risk of collapse. Build Change 
designs disaster-resistant homes and schools and trains builders, owners, engineers, 
and government employees on proper construction. The program is carried out in 
close contact with its beneficiaries, making them part of both the decision-making 
and construction processes. The result is a lasting change in construction practices by 
developing abilities for the local population.

Some strategies that Build Change uses in its projects are adopting local solutions 
to  determine  the  most  profitable  construction  models,  empowering  homeowners 
who  design  their  houses,  participating  in  production  processes,  taking  advantage 

of  knowledge  and  technology  developed  around  the  world  (technical  excellence), 
purchasing available materials (economic growth for the community), creating jobs 
for local construction workers, and exchanging knowledge with other post-disaster 
construction agencies.

In Latin America, Build Change has worked in countries such as Guatemala, Peru, 
Ecuador,  and  Colombia.  In  Colombia,  both  the  Bogotá  and  the  Medellín  Mayor’s 
Offices  have  recognized  the  importance  of  involvement  as  key  to  improving 
home  construction.  As  a  result,  they  have  allocated  funds  to  subsidize  structural 
improvements in vulnerable neighborhoods. Build Change provides technical support 
to these municipalities to reinforce unsafe buildings and hopes to eventually expand 
the program in places where it currently has a presence as well as other countries.

DESCRIPTION
 
The  Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  must  be 
prepared  to  face  threats  of  all  kinds  and  must 
have the capacity to recover quickly. This action 
proposes insuring buildings as an urgent need to 
aid in the city’s economic recovery after a large 
disaster. This initiative, to be applied across the 
entire city, would substantially reduce insurance 
premium costs and should be affordable for the 
most vulnerable population.

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND
 
Insurance  is  an  effective  way  to  protect  assets 
and  livelihoods  at  risk.  An  insurance  program 
ultimately reduces reliance on humanitarian aid. It 
also helps people to rebuild their lives, especially 
in the most vulnerable sectors. Having access to ex 
ante disaster risk reduction measures and building 
on  realistic  and  viable  recovery  plans  builds 
confidence  and  encourages  greater  investment 
in city development (RMS, 2017). This action also 
encourages  community  awareness  about  risk, 
building code compliance, and the generation of 
an insurance culture.

DESCRIPTION 

RESILIENCE DIVIDEND

The creation of a Metropolitan Resilience Council 
enables the participation of various stakeholders, 
including  different 
levels  of  government, 
international  organizations,  the  private  sector, 
and  academia,  to  monitor 
implementation 
and  continue  the  city’s  Resilience  Strategy.  The 
Metropolitan  Resilience  Council  also  provides 
guidance  and  technical  and  organizational 
experience  to  support  the  development  and 
promotion of future actions that will strengthen 
the construction of resilience in the city.

The  city’s  preparedness  in  facing  possible  acute 
shocks and increasingly extreme chronic stresses 
is  strengthened  through  coordination  between 
representatives  of  different  parts  of  society.  The 
growing need not only to plan for these events, but 
also to reduce the acute shocks through conscious 
adaptation requires a coordinated effort. This type 
of inclusive planning leads to long-term benefits, 
such as the appropriation of actions by different 
stakeholders and the co-responsibility of several 
sectors under a common agenda.

INSPIRATION FROM THE 100RC NETWORK: 
SANTIAGO RESILIENCE COUNCIL

As  part  of  the  process  to  build  the  Santiago  City  Resilience  Strategy,  a  Public-
Private  Resilience  Council  was  created,  made  up  of  35  experts  from  academia, 
government, NGOs, private-sector representatives, and professional associations. 
Public-sector  participants  included  regional  departments  and  ministries,  local 
governments, and mayors. The private sector is represented by utility companies, 
the  Chilean  Chamber  of  Commerce,  and  the  Chilean  Construction  Chamber; 
there are also representatives from academia and other social organizations. The 
objective is to include diverse stakeholders from the city in making decisions on 
issues related to the impacts and stresses faced by Santiago.

The council holds monthly topical sessions with the city’s resilience team, following 
an approach especially created to generate ideas and share input on each topic. 
This method is key to analyze a representative case in each problem area and 
identify  lessons  learned,  recommendations,  and  specific  actions  that  can  be 
implemented at a regional level. The information is organized after each session 
and sent to the roundtable participants before presenting the proposals to the 
appropriate agencies.

After  publishing  the  Chile  Resilience  Strategy,  the  Public-Private  Resilience 
Council will continue to hold meetings as a control agency and to follow up on

9. THE ROAD FROM HERE

                             MOVING THE RESILIENCE AGENDA FORWARD

Beyond  the  management  indicators  proposed  to  monitor 
each  action,  the  effective  implementation  of  the  DMQ 
Resilience  Strategy  requires  a  permanent  process  of 
monitoring  and  follow-up  of  the  strategy’s  achievements 
and reach. To accomplish this, a system of indicators able to 
monito impact articulated with the pillars and goals of the 
strategy, the Metropolitan Plan for Development and Land 
Management  (PMDOT),  the  United  Nations  Sustainable 
Development  Goals  (SDG),  and  the  New  Urban  Agenda 
(NAU) is established.

The design of the indicators is based on a multidimensional 
approach  that  identified  cross-disciplinary  support  points 
to  ensure  a  comprehensive  strategy.  It  should  be  noted 
that  implementation  of  the  strategy  does  not  focus  on 
a  single  theme,  but  incorporates  a  systems  approach 
through synergies between actions. Within the strategy, the 
correlation between these actions through the goals is not 
only addressed within each pillar, but between the goals of 
all pillars—an exercise that enables contributions to other 
pillars simultaneously. As a second step, a contribution and 
correlation analysis was carried out with the objectives and 
goals of the PMDOT.

Subsequently,  the  contribution  of  the  Resilience  Strategy 
to  achieve  the  SDG  was  supported  by  the  memorandum 
of  understanding  signed  between  the  Municipality  of  the 
Metropolitan  District  of  Quito  and  the  United  Nations 
Development Program in Ecuador for the implementation 
of  the  SDG  and  NAU  in  the  city.  From  this  agreement,  a 
process has begun to align local planning and management 
goals  with  global  agendas.  Within  this  framework,  a 
specific  diagnosis  was  made  of  the  level  of  alignment  of 
the PMDOT with Agenda 2030 (SDG). The Rapid Integrated 
Assessment  (RIA)  methodology  developed  by  the  United 
Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP)  has  been  used  to 
help countries and cities assess their level of preparedness 
for  the  implementation  of  the  United  Nations  SDGs.  The 

result  of  this  assessment  has  made  it  possible  to  identify 
the  existing  relationships  between  PMDOT  policies  and 
objectives and SDG goals and targets. These will serve as a 
basis for a proposal to align the PMDOT with Agenda 2030 
and the SDG.

This  assessment  also  serves  as  a  basis  for  the  design 
of  an  array  of  impact  indicators  that  can  contribute  in 
a  multidimensional  way,  at  the  level  of  objectives  and 
policies,  to  the  PMDOT  and  to  the  SDG.  The  indicators 
outlined seek to be abstract, general, and replicable in the 
medium and long term. They consist of variables that are 
concrete and empirically measurable, and they record the 
recurrence of phenomena and their persistence over time or 
their variations.

All these elements allow a selective mechanism of indicators 
to function, which operates through filters of relevance and 
consistency. Relevance refers to logical construction based 
on the content of the strategy; consistency, however, refers 
to the existence of sources of information or to the feasibility 
of constructing and applying instruments that allow it to be 
produced. In the first case, the indicators and their variables 
will function based on the administrative information from 
the management processes (information gathered through 
administrative  data  from  local  and  national  government 
bodies). In the second case, it is a matter of designing and 
applying  instruments  deliberately  constructed  to  produce 
such information (quantitative and qualitative techniques).
Appendix  2  presents  the  matrix  of  indicators  for  Resilient 
Quito,  which  is  structured  according  to  the  five  pillars 
of  work  and  their  respective  goals  and  indicators.  The 
identification  of  these  indicators  has  taken  into  account 
the different planning and management instruments (such 
as  the  ICQ-MDQ  quality  of  life  index,  PMDOT  policies  and 
objectives, the United Nations SDGs, and the NUA indicators 
and targets) that correspond to these goals. Each indicator 
is accompanied by its description and assessment.

Resilient  Quito  is  the  result  of  the  priceless  contributions 
of many people with profound knowledge of the city. The 
intuition and inspiration generously provided by key actors 
during  countless  discussions,  brainstorming  sessions, 
structured workshops, and research fueled this work. This 
must continue.
 
After  its  publication,  an  implementation  plan  will  be 
constructed  with  the  different  municipal  agencies  of  the 
city  and  partners  working  together  to  identify  priority 
actions and design and develop programs and projects that 
create  a  time  frame  transcending  election  cycles,  identify 
resources,  and  establish  a  road  map  in  order  to  achieve 
effective results. Together with these stakeholders, we will 
forge the connections between Resilient Quito and the city, 
especially with and for the most vulnerable. In this sense, 
the  Resilience  Advisory  Council  and  its  members  will  act 
not only as partners in the implementation, but also in the 
follow- up process to Resilient Quito.
 
At  the  institutional  level,  the  process  carried  out  with 
the  different  municipal  agencies  clearly  established  the 
importance  of  multisector  contributions  and  the  need 
to  generate  internal  synergies.  For  this  reason,  special 
emphasis will be placed on delving deeper into the model 
of  collaborative  work  and  inviting  stakeholders  from  the 
private  sector,  the  academic  world,  other  municipalities, 

and NGOs to join in the effort. We start by recognizing that 
there  is  accumulated  knowledge  and  experience  as  well 
as  successful  practices  that  can  contribute  to  the  city’s 
development.
 
At  the  international  level,  through  the  100RC  initiative, 
we  have  found  that  there  is  a  wide  “library”  of  valuable 
experiences,  and  that  the  great  potential  of  collaboration 
with cities has much to contribute in terms of acute shocks 
and  common  chronic  stresses.  100RC  and  other  networks 
can help us build an international agenda that guides and 
catalizes efforts through relevant experiences. At the same 
time, continued collaboration with the initiative’s platform 
partners,  which  have  contributed  with  work,  initiatives 
and technical guidance, and with other new partners with 
different capacities and knowledge, will allow us to use all 
these  resources  strategically  to  implement  the  resilience 
agenda.

Finally, the road to building resilience is a continuous process 
of  constant  learning  in  order  to  face  multiple  and  ever-
changing  urban  challenges.  The  city’s  capacity  to  survive 
and thrive requires a monitoring system to ensure periodic 
evaluations  that  show  the  advances  in  implementing  the 
Resilience Strategy. This monitoring system will also make it 
possible to verify the impact of the different initiatives that 
contribute to building the city’s resilience.

| RESILIENT QUITO11. GLOSSARY

Anthropogenic threat: Threat that originates from human actions (uncontrolled burning of grassland, accidents, settlements in 
unsafe zones).

Biodiversity: Term used to refer to the variety of life on earth, including all organisms, species and populations; the genetic variation 
between them; and their complex communities and ecosystems (UNEP).

Biological diversity: Biodiversity is not equitably distributed, but varies widely across the world as well as within regions. Among 
other factors, the diversity of all living things (biota) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils, geography and the 
presence of other species.

Citizen participation: Individual and collective actions designed to identify and address issues of public interest. It is a collective 
commitment to work to make a difference in the civic life of communities and to develop the combination of knowledge, skills, 
values and motivation to make that difference. It means promoting quality of life, both through political and non-political processes 
(New York Times).

Climate change: A change in climate, directly or indirectly attributable to human activity, that alters the composition of the global 
atmosphere and adds to the natural climate variability observed over comparable periods of time (UNFCCC).

Climate change adaptation: Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected stimuli or climatic effects, 
mitigating harm or exploiting beneficial opportunities (UNFCCC).

Climate change mitigation: In the context of climate change, this refers to human interventions to reduce sources of greenhouse 
gases or increase sinks of greenhouse gases. The reduction includes using fossil fuels more efficiently or switching to solar or wind 
energy; “sinks” are forests or oceans in such a condition that they are able to remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere (UNFCCC).

Collective transport: Public transport or common transport of passengers.

Decent work: Sums up the aspirations of people in their working lives. It implies opportunities for productive work that provides a 
fair income, workplace safety, and social protection for families; better prospects for personal development and social integration; 
freedom to express concerns, organize, and participate in decisions that affect their lives; and equal opportunities and equal 
treatment for all women and men (ILO).

Demographic Bonus: The potential for economic growth that can be derived from changes in the age structure of a population, 
especially when the proportion of the working-age population (ages 15 to 64) is higher than that of the population below 14 years 
and over 65 years (UNFP).

Disaster: A serious disruption in the functioning of a community or society that causes a large number of deaths as well as material, 
economic, and environmental losses, and impacts that exceed the capacity of the affected community or society to deal with the 
situation through use of its own resources.

Early warning system: The set of capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely and meaningful alert information to enable 
individuals, communities, and organizations threatened by a disruptive event to prepare and act appropriately and with sufficient 
time in advance to reduce the likelihood of loss or damage (UNISDR).

Economy of agglomeration: In an urban economy, agglomeration economy refers to the benefits obtained from the agglomeration 
of economic activities. This concentration in a given area allows the growth and expansion of economic activities in other areas due 
to the location and cost minimization decisions that companies take to maintain high productivity and gain competitive advantages 
(Stephen, 2013).

Ecosystem: A community of living organisms in conjunction with non-living components of their environment (e.g., air, water, or 
mineral soil) that interact as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are considered to be linked together through nutrient 
cycles and energy flows (Odum, 1971).

Ecosystem diversity: Addresses ecosystem variations within a geographic location and their overall impact on human existence 
and the environment.

Ecosystem services: The benefits people and communities derive from ecosystems. Among the benefits that ecosystems can offer 
are so-called “regulatory services,” such as flood regulation, drought and soil degradation, as well as “provision services,” such 
as food and water; “support services,” such as soil formation and nutrient cycling; and “cultural services,” such as recreational, 
spiritual, religious, and other non-material benefits (UNISDR).

Environmental degradation: Reducing the capacity of the environment to respond to social and ecological needs and objectives 
(UNISDR).

Exposure: The population, properties, systems or other elements present in areas where there are threats, which are therefore 
likely to experience potential losses (UNISDR).

Geological fault: In geology, a discontinuity in a volume of rock through which a significant displacement occurs as a result of 
the movement of rock mass. The release of energy associated with rapid movement in active faults is the cause of most seismic 
movements (Allaby, 2015).

Greenhouse gases: The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climate change. The main GHGs are carbon 
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20). Less frequent but very potent greenhouse gases are hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) (UNFCCC).

Governance: Term designating the effectiveness, quality, and good orientation of state intervention, which provides a good part of 
its legitimacy on the basis of achieving lasting economic, social, and institutional development and promoting a healthy balance 
between the state, civil society, and economic markets (RAE).

Human development: Expanding people’s opportunities, paying heed to the richness of human lives and not just the wealth of 
economies (UNDP).

Human diversity: The various physical and social aspects of the human family, i.e., its genetic and cultural variety (Durham, 1991).

Natural threat: A natural process or phenomenon that can cause death, injury, or other health impacts, as well as property damage, 
loss of livelihood and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Participatory democracy: The effort to create opportunities for all members of a population to contribute meaningfully to decision 
making, and the effort to broaden the range of people who have access to such opportunities (Shirky, 2008).

Physical vulnerability: The risk assessment of an element exposed to a possible acute impact requires a consideration of the 
physical vulnerability of the element, which expresses its propensity to suffer damages (Douglas, 2007).

Resilience: The ability of a system, community, or society exposed to a threat to resist, absorb, adapt, and recover from its effects in 
a timely and effective manner, including preservation and restoration of its basic structures and functions (UNISDR).

| 118 |
| 118 | GLOSSARY |

| 119 |

| RESILIENT QUITOResilience qualities: Seven qualities that allow cities to withstand, respond, and adapt more easily to acute shocks and chronic 
stresses (100RC).

Response capacity: The ability of people, organizations, and systems to address and manage adverse conditions, emergencies, or 
disasters, using available resources and skills (UNFCCC).

Risk: The combination of probability of occurrence of an event and its negative consequences (UNISDR).

Social capital: Networks that, together with norms, values, and shared understanding, facilitate cooperation within or between 
groups. In this definition, networks are understood as real-world links between groups or individuals (e.g., networks of friends, 
family networks, networks of former colleagues). Social capital provides the means of facilitating cooperation, exchange, and 
innovation (OECD).

Social cohesion: A group’s tendency to be unified while working towards a goal or striving to meet the emotional needs of its 
members (Carron and Brawley, 2000).

Social vulnerability: A pre-existing condition that affects the ability of a society to prepare and recover from a disruptive event.

Sustainability: Derived from the words “sustained” and “ability,” refers to the capacity of biological systems to remain diverse 
and productive over time. In more general terms, it refers to the permanence of systems and processes. The guiding principle of 
sustainability  is  sustainable  development,  which  includes  the  four  interconnected  domains:  ecology,  economics,  politics,  and 
culture (James et al., 2015).

Sustainable development: Meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
own needs (Brundtland Commission). It cannot be achieved without ensuring that all women, men, boys, and girls enjoy human 
dignity and the right to expand their capacities, ensure their reproductive health and rights, find decent work, and contribute to 
economic growth (UNFPA).

Threat: A phenomenon, substance, human activity, or dangerous condition that can cause death, injury, or other health impacts, 
as well as damage to property, loss of livelihood and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage (UNISDR).

Urban compactness: an urbanism and urban design concept for a compact city, of short distances, that promotes a relatively 
high residential density with mixed uses within a city. It is based on an efficient public transport system and an urban design that 
encourages walking and cycling, low energy consumption, and pollution reduction. The concept favors a large resident population 
offering opportunities for social interaction as well as a sense of security due to the number of people with “eyes on the street” 
(Jacobs, 1961).

Vulnerability: The characteristics and circumstances of a community or system that make them susceptible to the harmful effects 
of a threat (UNISDR).

APPENDICES |

A3.1 Citizenship and the most emitting sectors have reduced their carbon footprint, and 
compensation projects are promoted.

A4.1 Environmental pollution has been reduced, through regulation and a prevention 
approach to productive sectors, activities and projects within the DMQ.
A4.4 Wastewater discharge into water streams and into the watershed is eliminated, 
and a process of recovery of streams is consolidated. 
A4.5 Air pollution caused by car transport has been reduced.
A5.1 Economic activities implement measures aimed at sustainable production 
(optimization of resource use, inputs and raw materials and reduction of pollutants).
A5.2 Behavioral changes in citizens are evidenced, they now apply measures aimed at 
sustainable consumption.
A5.3 Citizens improved behavior and habits as they understand its impact on the 
environmental management of the DMQ. They assume the responsibility for solving 
environmental problems and climate change actions. 

M1.1 Public Transport will be used as a preferred transportation mode. This will happen 
with the use of a mass transit integrated system with high levels of quality and 
efficiency, using Metro as the main city spine with enhanced travel times, connectivity 
and coverage.
M2.1 Gas emission levels and noise generated by motor vehicles will be reduced, 
improving their technology, especially the public transport fleet.

M3.1 Quality pedestrian networks will be implemented, they will meet design standards 
in order to facilitate pedestrian mobility, especially for the most vulnerable groups (chil-
dren, people with disabilities, students, seniors).
M3.2 With the provision of safe infrastructure, the use of bicycles will be encouraged as 
an alternative mode of short distance travel. This will include connections that favor the 
exchange with motorized transportation modes.
M6.1 The road system will be improved and increased, especially arterial and express 
ways in order to enhance the conditions of circulation, connectivity and accessibility to 
different work, housing, and recreation nodes.

M7.1 Connectivity between isolated sectors will be improved and increased. Areas are 
isolated due to inadequate road communication and poor public transport and the 
origin of this problem is the lack of road infrastructure.

PTEG2.A Consolidate a territorial model with well-defined boundaries between the 
urban, agricultural and protected territories.

PA3. Ensure local sustainability by focusing on the 
reduction and compensation of the carbon footprint and 
the resilience of the DMQ emphasized in climate change.
PA4. Guarantee the right of citizens to live in a healthy 
environment, by ensuring the quality of natural resources.

PA5. Promote the principles of a sustainable city, supported 
by joint commitments that can influence the production 
patterns, behaviors and consumption habits of all sectors 
of the DMQ. 

Quito, Smart City - Mobility, an articulation factor

tivity and integration of the services of the Metro¬politan 
Transportation System, allocating the financial resources in 
correspondence to the demands of trips served. 
PM2. Promote the use of clean technologies in public 
transport in order to allow optimal levels of automotive 
performance to improve the quality of the environment.

accordance with the strategic growth of the city and urban 
planning, prioritizing public transport to reduce depen-
dence on private transport, being keen on allocating 
facilities to motivate the development of pedestrian 
mobility and cycling.
PM7. Develop mobility planning jointly with land use plan-
ning, in order to create new central and peripheral urban 
spaces by providing them with mixed land uses, with equip-
ment that can handle the different labor, educational, 
administrative and recreational activities, in order to 
in¬duce short distance travel without the need to use a 
private vehicle. 
POLICY 1 - GLOBAL SCALE
PTEG1. Seek integration with decentralized autonomous 
governments in order to give continuity to productive 
processes, especially agricultural and agroindustrial, and to 
give coherence to the way of using and occupying the land 
with the surrounding territories. A demarcation of precise 
boundaries between the consolidated urban territory, 
the territory with ecological protection, and the territory 
that does not belong to either of these two conditions is 
in order, in favor of a coherent articulation between urban 
sys¬tems, productive systems and ecological systems 
needs that unfold in the territory.
