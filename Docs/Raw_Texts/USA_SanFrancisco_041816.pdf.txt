Patrick Otellini, Chief Resilience Officer

One hundred and ten years ago, San Francisco was devastated by the 
great earthquake and fire of 1906. In the wake of this tragedy, we began 
to define what it means to be a resilient city. Our ability to not only 
bounce back, but rather bounce forward, has been a theme and a spirit 
that has carried us through other challenges over the years. We stand 
together now to make San Francisco a city that everyone can have an 
opportunity to call home.

During my time as the City Administrator, I began to institutionalize 
resilience by launching several programs aimed at preparing our 
residents, buildings and infrastructure to be ready for the challenges 
of the next century. We are strengthening our buildings to be ready for 
future earthquakes; we have developed an action plan to address rising 
sea levels; and we are committed to housing production, protection 
of our residents, education, and sustainable jobs to help shore up our 
social fabric that makes our community thrive because of its diversity. 

Resilient San Francisco was developed over the course of 18 
months through a process that involved more than 186 individuals, 
31 government agencies, and 56 NGO and private sector organizations. 
It lays out the City’s resilience goals that we will continue to track 
and measure as we update this living document to ensure the City 
is working together with our communities, and continuing to work 
diligently toward these goals. San Francisco is a resilient city, but we 
must not forget what is at stake.

These challenges present opportunities to leverage our ideas, people, 
and culture to continue to build and protect our San Francisco for 
generations to come. 

Mayor Edwin M. Lee

San Francisco is filled 
with dedicated individuals 
working hard to make a 
difference. We are taking 
an integrated approach 
to resilience that will 

better prepare us for the uncertainties of 
tomorrow. That is at the core of resilience 
thinking. Understanding urban resilience 
is like recognizing the difference between 
learning and education. Building resilience 
is an ongoing process like learning, not 
a milestone like a graduation or another 
traditional educational goal. Every day we 
are actively learning from our experiences, 
and this is a process that never stops. 
Resilience is something that we must 
constantly strive toward, a process, and 
this strategy provides a road map to help 
our City and our communities continue on 
a path to a more resilient future. 

Patrick Otellini 
Chief Resilience Officer 

San Francisco’s resilience 
will ultimately be 
defined and measured 
by the ability of its 
residents, businesses and 
government to quickly 

respond to and effectively recover from 
an event. We must remember that, 
although earthquakes are San Francisco’s 
most immediate identifiable threat, 
there are and will continue to be other 
environmental stresses and challenges 
that impact our capacity and resilience 
as a city and region.

Improving the City’s individual systems 
and structures will increase the City’s 
resilience overall. That is why resilience 
must be a multi-pronged strategy focused 
on establishing a framework by which we 
can ensure that the decisions we make 
are based on an integrated approach 
that will yield multiple benefits today 
and tomorrow. 

Resilient San Francisco is about 
identifying our vulnerabilities, 
implementing strategies and programs 
that further the City’s resilience and 
capacity, and tracking our overall 
progress and performance in meeting our 
identified resilience goals to ensure our 
accountability.

City and County of San FranciscoResilient San FranciscoINTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

San Francisco has never been a sleepy town. We are no strangers to change, 
to reimagination, to bold vision. Since the 1906 earthquake and fire, the 110th 
anniversary of which this strategy commemorates, we have faced countless 
challenges. In the century since that disaster, San Francisco has remade itself 
time and time again. Our city is both a capital of innovation and a flashpoint 
for many of the country’s most daunting urban struggles. It is a city with a long 
history of advocacy and acceptance, and a city that struggles with its own 
contemporary identity. San Francisco has never shied away from hard questions, 
tough tasks or complicated reality, though. Today’s San Francisco is—and will 
be—no different. 

Cities around the world are grappling with the realities of climate change and 
rising seas, escalating urbanization and increasingly frequent disruptions of 
daily life. Here in San Francisco, we are struggling with how the hazards we 
face—and our response to them—expose several interdependencies that we 
must better understand. What is 21st century San Francisco? To whom will this 
city be available? How can we maintain our San Francisco values and, perhaps, 
make them even stronger?

RESILIENT-SF is a strategy that seeks to tap into our city’s trademark 
tenacity by laying out our most pressing challenges and demanding that City 
government partner with the community to make bold and lasting progress 
on these challenges. When we think about San Francisco, we think of a city of 
unwavering strength, a city that is prepared to not only respond but to recover, 
and a San Francisco of strong and unified neighborhoods, ready to continue 
reimagining, and striving for the strong and resilient San Francisco of tomorrow.

SF@1M The Association of Bay Area Governments projects 

that the population of San Francisco will grow to 
1 million, and the Bay Area will grow to 7.2 million 

residents by 2040. This requires our planning to consider this additional 
capacity. But San Francisco is growing at a rate that projects 1 million residents 
by 2040. This idea of San Francisco at 1 million residents (or SF@1M) appears 
throughout this strategy, and reminds us that we need to consider adding 
additional capacity when needed and to look for more opportunities to take 
an integrated approach. We cannot just plan for our needs of today but rather 
must work together to plan for the needs of a growing population: SF@1M.

Resilient San FranciscoCity and County of San FranciscoINTRODUCTION

We face several interconnected challenges:

OUR STRATEGY, OUR CHALLENGES AND OUR GOALS 

4
3

2

1

 EARTHQUAKES

There is a 76 percent chance 
the Bay Area will experience 
a 7.0 magnitude earthquake 

in the next 30 years. Even the relatively 
moderate and distant 1989 Loma Prieta 
Earthquake (6.9) caused substantial 
damage to our city. It is imperative to the 
survival of San Francisco that we continue 
working to prepare for and recover from 
the “big one.”

 CLIMATE CHANGE

The impacts of global climate 
change are already being 
felt in the form of drought 

and increasingly severe storm events. 
We must secure our city’s future through 
mitigation, while recognizing the likely 
impacts of climate change by beginning 
to adapt today rather than when it is 
too late.

 SEA LEVEL RISE

We expect a total of 66 
inches of sea level rise to 
impact our shores by 2100. 

As we plan for the growth of our city, 
we need to adapt to this challenge that 
threatens not only our waterfront but 
also our way of life in San Francisco 
and regionally.

 INFRASTRUCTURE

Infrastructure is central to 
our daily lives—from the 
roads and pipes we use 

every day, to the larger systems, like food, 
social networks and housing that we rely 
on as lifelines. Sometimes these systems 
continue to operate past their intended 
life span, and sometimes they are 
inadequate altogether to meet the needs 
of a growing and vibrant city. 

 SOCIAL INEQUITY

San Francisco embraces 
equality and equity 
in all policies, but this 

work is never done. Social equity and 
inclusiveness need to be at the core of 
what makes a city thrive.  
 
 

 UNAFFORDABILITY

Forty-five percent of renters 
in San Francisco pay more 
than 30 percent of their 

household income in rent. Median home 
prices are continuing to rise, making it 
a challenge for first-time homebuyers. 
San Francisco is becoming out of reach 
for many of the people who made the city 
what it is today.

With an eye toward both process and product, we take a long view of resilience. What 
will San Francisco be like with nearly 160,000 new residents? How will population 
growth impact the challenges we already face? What new challenges will we face, 
and what strengths will SF@1M add to our city by 2040? And, most importantly, how 
can we begin to accommodate this growth, while facing both the challenges of today 
and tomorrow?

We have determined four actionable goals to address those challenges. Each goal was 
formed from, and will be supported by, leveraging successful City department-level 
initiatives, as well as supporting efforts (e.g., department studies, existing projects) 
within each goal’s policy area:

1 Plan and Prepare for Tomorrow 

San Francisco’s challenges build slowly and quickly, steadily and suddenly. This 
goal looks toward building our city’s capacity to handle today’s challenges and 
tomorrow’s disasters. We address land use planning and recovery planning, as 
well as earthquake planning and preparedness.

2  Mitigate, Adapt and Retrofit 

We face a future with certain challenges. This goal looks to confront the 
pressing realities of an imminent large earthquake, a changing climate and rising 
seas, all while building a stronger city today. 

3 Ensure Housing for San Franciscans Today  

and After a Disaster 
Today’s challenges will only worsen with tomorrow’s disruptions. We must work 
now to ensure housing for all San Franciscans before and after a disaster. We 
will work to address our city’s housing and homeless crises through innovative 
policies, reimagining and bold action to build a stronger city for today 
and tomorrow.

4 Empower Neighbors and Neighborhoods 

through Improved Connections 
 San Francisco is a city of neighborhoods and neighbors. This goal seeks to 
build on the strength of our city’s character and vibrancy, by being effective 
governmental stewards of resilient, healthy and cohesive neighborhoods based 
in trust, equity and partnership.

RESILIENCE IS ABOUT LASTING ACTION

 

This strategy has the power to transform San Francisco. Ultimately, 
though, effective implementation is paramount. Clear, actionable 
steps are the foundation of urban resilience, building momentum and 
continual support for the work we do. These goals can only be achieved 
if the City partners with communities to take a stand and make the hard 
decisions necessary to secure a better future for all San Franciscans. 
Some of the hallmark actions this strategy will take include…

■■ A new Office of Resilience and Recovery

■■ Create capacity to house a population expected to grow to 

1 million residents by 2040.

■■ A disaster housing and governance plan for long-term recovery

■■ Launching a regional resilience design challenge 

■■ Constructing a disaster-resilient waterfront by 2040

■■ Seismic retrofit of vulnerable buildings and set a higher level of 

safety for new buildings

■■ Advance Citywide adaptation planning for sea level rise

This strategy cannot fix every problem or answer every question. But 
it prioritizes the challenges we face, tackling them with bold goals 
and decisive action. As we approach SF@1M, it takes a hard look at 
our transportation and land use planning, our disaster and recovery 
planning, our climate readiness and critical neighborhood programs. 
Foremost, this strategy is intended to foster dialogue between 
San Francisco government and the community, between departments 
within San Francisco government, between cities in the region, between 
neighbors. To advance progress on these challenges, we have created a 
strategy consisting of:

How to read this strategy

San Francisco is a world leader in 
innovation, in social justice advocacy, 
in livable and sustainable urbanism. 
As a city, we have a long history of 
coming together to fight for a better 
future, not only for our city but the 
world. Our city also sits at the precipice 
of great challenges. How can we face 
these challenges, while becoming more 
equitable and affordable, stronger and 
empowered, and also more prepared? 
How can we look toward San Francisco 
at 1 million residents, or SF@1M, as we are 
calling this important milestone, and not 
only maintain our San Francisco values, 
but build on them? 

Four goals seeking to address  

six key challenges that face San Francisco—

from stressors or long-term challenges 

to shocks or disaster events. 

 

 

Each goal contains a series  
of actions aimed at making 

progress on the goals. 

A series of metrics allows us 

 to evaluate progress on the goals; and 

A set of existing, supporting  

and new initiatives.

Between 2010 and 2040, the region is projected to grow from 
3.4 million jobs and 7.2 million people to 4.7 million jobs and a 
population of 9.5 million. We estimate this will result in almost 
3.6 million households and demand for more than 3.6 million 
housing units. The forecast projects: 

An increase of 
783,000 households. 
Only 13 percent of that 
increase occurred between 
2010 and 2015, but the 
pace of household growth 
will increase as the 
population ages. 

An additional 
823,000 housing units.  
Only 8 percent of this growth 
had occurred by 2015, 
highlighting the need for a 
focused effort to expand 
housing production to meet 
the needs of our broad range 
of household types. Of the

about 39,600 come from 
the increment of units added 
to the Regional Housing 
Control Total to meet the legal

City and County of San FranciscoResilient San FranciscoINTRODUCTION

RESILIENCE FOR SAN FRANCISCO

Resilience describes the capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt and 
grow, no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they 
experience. Approaching challenges through the lens of resilience 
helps cities better serve their residents today and plan for the longer 
term. Resilience demands moving beyond reaction through proactive 
planning. The approach calls for considering problems systematically, 
seeking out departmental and conceptual relationships from which 
solutions can be more completely developed, and bridging the practice 
gaps between social justice, sustainability, disaster recovery and 
other areas. 

Resilience is Process‑Oriented

For San Francisco, resilience is as much about process as about 
product. Our desire is to build a strong culture of resilience, a culture 
where varied challenges are approached strategically—both through 
bold goal-setting and in an integrated manner, where co-benefits and 
comprehensive solutions are identified and implemented through 
stakeholder collaboration. This strategy seeks to institutionalize and 
embed this culture within our City government and our neighborhoods. 
It will serve as the ongoing centerpiece of an interdepartmental 
dialogue and an extensive, yearlong community workshop process, all 
through a new Office of Resilience and Recovery under the Office of the 
City Administrator. 

Stronger Today, Stronger Tomorrow

For San Francisco, resilience begins with questions concerning recovery, 
but it certainly does not stop there. Today’s weaknesses will become 
tomorrow’s disasters. Disasters are not the disruptions that knock us 
down, but rather they are born from long-standing crises that keep us 
from getting back up again. This demands that we ask: Are we strong 
today? And, in the ways we are not, how can we begin to address these 
weaknesses today, before they become tomorrow’s disruptions? We 
know an earthquake is coming, and we know climate change will bring 
strong and lasting changes to our way of life here in San Francisco. We 
know that a robust economy still exists in a boom and bust cycle. These 
facts, these questions, and the knowledge that SF@1M is just around the 
corner, pose a challenge—a challenge to think more comprehensively, 
to consider integrating ideas, partners and departments more closely, 
and to plan for a stronger today and a stronger tomorrow. This is our 
San Francisco baseline for understanding and implementing resilience.

INTRODUCTION

AN INTEGRATED APPROACH

At all stages of the resilience-building process, our focus is on taking 
an integrated approach. An integrated approach looks at systems and 
linkages—specifically, it requires thinking about relationships between 
departments, between the government and residents, between the 
public sector and academia, between the public and private sectors, 
between problems. We are looking for co-benefits—moments 
when one solution, or a set of solutions, contributes to progress on 
multiple problems. We look past silos, trying to find connections and 
redundancies. We look outside the normal processes and ask: How can 
we do this better? 

CREATING OUR RESILIENCE STRATEGY

One Hundred Resilient Cities (100RC)—Pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation—kicked off in 2013, connecting cities around the world to 
the funding necessary to hire a Chief Resilience Officer, as well as the 
technical assistance necessary to advance resilience. San Francisco was 
one of the cities selected in the first round of the 100RC initiative, and 
over the course of the last 18 months, we have met and worked with 
more than 30 government agencies, and over 50 community-based 
organizations and private sector partners, to develop an actionable 
strategy aimed at understanding and then advancing urban resilience in 
San Francisco and regionally. 

These working groups leveraged expertise, while building relationships 
and beginning a new chapter in the dialogue around resilience in 
San Francisco. Workshops with our partners, community groups and 
City officials allowed experts within individual fields, departments and 
policy areas to add their understanding of resilience and the needs of 
the City to the process. These workshops were the beginning of an 
iterative process; stakeholders were engaged at the various steps of 
translating the content of the meetings into the strategy itself. 

The City has also collaborated with and learned from other 
participating cities around the world, from Rotterdam and Christchurch 
to cities closer to home, like Los Angeles, Oakland and Berkeley. These 
cities approach resilience-building in their own context, but all cities 
have common threads of doing what we can now to help us face an 
uncertain future. Working together helps us find new and more creative 
solutions to address the challenges each city faces.

City and County of San FranciscoResilient San FranciscoINTRODUCTION

A Call to Community‑Led Action

Now is the time to act! This strategy and its implementation have 
the power to transform San Francisco—not just in what we do but in 
how we do it. Ultimately, though, this strategy lives and dies on the 
work that can and will be done. Clear, actionable steps forward are 
the foundation of urban resilience, building momentum and continual 
support for the work we all share. Each of these goals can only be met 
if the City works hand in hand with our community to take a stand 
and make the hard decisions necessary to secure a better future for all 
San Franciscans as we approach SF@1M. These are the indicators of 
progress that will guide the implementation of this work. 

The Office of Resilience and Recovery

With the launch of this strategy comes the founding of a new office 
within the San Francisco City Administrator’s Office—the Office of 
Resilience and Recovery. This office will be charged with managing 
the city’s ongoing resilience challenge, and with championing our 
city’s earthquake preparedness and recovery work. This challenge 
involves working across departments and agencies to determine and 
continue clear action, to build the narrative around resilience internally, 
and to find connection points with ongoing strategic planning and 
comprehensive planning processes.

Accountability and Transparency—Annual Strategy Updates

With the launch of this strategy and the formation of the Office of 
Resilience and Recovery, we are partnering with Neighborland, a 
platform for collaboration, and Appallicious, a data collection company, 
to launch a citywide, neighborhood by neighborhood, community 
engagement process. We will present the strategy to community 
leaders, as well as members of the public, to workshop it, to improve 
upon it, to add to it and to tell us what we missed or should do 
differently. Additionally, the ORR will update the strategy annually, in 
order to measure the progress the City is making toward its bold goals. 
These processes will form an even stronger strategy, working with the 
community and our partners within government, to advance and build 
a strong culture of resilience in San Francisco.

Introduction

For San Francisco, challenges are opportunities. By planning and 
preparing for tomorrow, we build a stronger and more resilient city 
today—one ready for SF@1M, and ready for any crisis ahead. Each 
improvement we plan, and each one we make, from earthquakes 
to our housing stock and urban form, and to our infrastructure and 
transportation, transforms San Francisco into a more flexible and 
dynamic city for today and tomorrow.

San Francisco has always been a city living on the edge—on the 
edge of the next global innovation; on the edge of social change 
and reinvention; and on the edge of peril, from earthquakes. With 
an uncertain global future, marked by a changing climate, growing 
unaffordability and inequality, and the certainty of a powerful 
earthquake, San Francisco is ready to take decisive and bold actions 
to maintain our most important values, while building the stronger, 
more equitable and prepared San Francisco.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates we have a 72 percent 
chance of a 6.7 magnitude or greater earthquake in the next 29 years. 
The population of San Francisco is growing at a rate of 10,000 new 
residents a year. At the same time, median rent has doubled in the last 
five years. Like cities all over the world, San Francisco is struggling 
with both chronic, day-to-day challenges and the threat of large-scale 
disasters. The time to act is now, because today’s weaknesses are 
tomorrow’s disasters.

The Central Subway 
Project will construct a 
modern, efficient light-rail 
line that will improve 
public transportation in 
San Francisco. This new 
1.7-mile extension of Muni’s 
T Third Line will provide 
direct connections to 
major retail, sporting and 
cultural venues, while 
efficiently transporting 
people to jobs, educational 
opportunities and other 
amenities throughout 
the city. 

28

We must continue to improve services, 
while thoughtfully planning for the 
San Francisco of tomorrow. To become 
resilient, we must foster a culture 
within government that considers the 
interaction between long-range planning, 
recovery planning and the day-to-day 
work in neighborhoods. We must ready 
ourselves for earthquakes by planning for 
response, mitigation and recovery. And 
finally, we must build a more sustainable 
and livable city. This chapter seeks to 
leverage existing actions and continue the 
emerging strategic dialogue among city 
leaders, which the Office of Resilience and 
Recovery hopes to help build. Integration 
is vital to the work of resilience—
searching cooperatively for co-benefits 
whenever and wherever possible, thinking 
strategically about short- and long-term 
problem solving, and always considering 
multiple hazards.

KEY INDICATORS:

To measure progress, San Francisco will:

■■ Complete a long-term disaster 

recovery governance plan by 2018.

■■ Train 2,000 Neighborhood Emergency 

Response Team members by 2018.

■■ Create a post-earthquake building 

re-occupancy tool by 2017.

■■ Build and develop a more robust 
preparedness culture focused on 
training all levels of city management—
not just emergency managers—
on response protocols and actions.  

■■ Invest in infrastructure that increases 

mobility capacity and usage, while 
decreasing the distance to essential 
services.  

A multiagency 
post-earthquake 
inspection 
exercise took 
place at City Hall 
during an already 
scheduled 
building 
evacuation 
exercise where 
inspectors 
practiced 
response 
protocols. More 
of this kind of 
training will 
better prepare 
us for future 
disasters.

Prepare Today for 
San Francisco’s Recovery

The keys to an effective recovery from disaster are careful planning today, a quick and robust 
response after the disaster, and a prepared community—always. Tomorrow’s recovery will only 
be as strong as today’s San Francisco. This action seeks to achieve preparedness, while 
planning beyond disaster response, building a San Francisco prepared to recover from any 
disruption.

ASPIRATION: San Francisco’s recovery starts the moment disaster strikes.

INITIATIVE  1.1 

Build Community Readiness 
through Education and Technology

When disaster strikes, San Franciscans must join together to begin 
the recovery process. To facilitate this through preparedness, the 
San Francisco Department of Emergency Management (DEM) has 
developed a next-generation preparation and community-building 
platform called “SF72.” SF72 builds on other services DEM already 
offers, like AlertSF, which allows community members to receive alerts 
regarding emergencies disrupting vehicular/pedestrian traffic, watches 
and warnings for tsunamis, flooding and Citywide post-disaster 
information. These services and platforms have the capacity to build 
community, while fostering a culture of preparedness. 

SF72 helps residents become more prepared, connects 
them and can serve as a post-disaster information 
hub. With tools like these, as well as DEM’s regular exercises and 
communication with the public—regarding everything from a winter 
storm to a gas leak downtown to a Giant’s game—San Francisco can 
begin to build a deep-seated culture of preparedness.

AlertSF is a text-based notification 
system for San Francisco’s residents 
and visitors. AlertSF will send alerts 
regarding emergencies disrupting 
vehicular/pedestrian traffic, watches 
and warnings for tsunamis, flooding 

and Citywide post-disaster information to your registered 
wireless devices and email accounts.

INITIATIVE  1.2

Ensure Effective City Operations 
during Response and Recovery 

The ability to continue with financial operations is a critical component 
to ensuring an effective post-disaster response. Under the Office of the 
Controller, SF-Prepared is helping San Francisco and other Bay Area 
cities to plan for an effective Citywide recovery through the financial 
and administrative tools needed for emergency response and recovery. 
San Francisco government agencies will leverage SF-Prepared to 
continue financial operations during a disaster or other disruption. We 
need to continue to implement SF-Prepared within the city’s day-to-day 
operations, including the training of all city departmental CFOs in post-
disaster cost-recovery processes.

The value of being prepared

Being financially prepared for a disaster will help you restore 
your short- and long-term financial position when a disaster 
occurs. Disasters can have a substantial, adverse impact on local 
governments. Below are some statistics on financial impacts of 
the Rim Fire and Loma Prieta Earthquake.

RIM FIRE 

In 2013, the Rim Fire 
burned over 250,000 
acres—the third-largest 
wildfire in California history. 
Infrastructure and other 
property of the San Francisco 
Public Utilities Commission, 

which operates the Hetch Hetchy 
Regional Water System, were 
severely damaged. The fire caused 
over $70 million in damages and 
other losses to local governments.

INTEGRATION 

Increase Training for Neighborhood 
Emergency Response Teams 

 “  Beginning with ourselves, we will be 

prepared and work as an individual or 
together as emergency response teams  
to assist our families and neighbors in  
time of disaster, and to be prepared to 
make decisions that do the Most Good 
for the Most People.”

—NERT Mission statement

In the coming year, Neighborhood 
Emergency Response Teams (NERT) aim 
to have 2,000 additional residents sign 
up for training or renew their existing 
certifications. By 2025, NERT plans to 
grow the number of trained residents 
overall by 30 percent. The new Office 
of Resilience and Recovery will provide 
additional support to the SFFD-NERT 
by partnering in a Citywide outreach 
campaign to help inform more residents 
about this free training opportunity. NERT 
will also further leverage the Office of 
Civic Innovation’s Startup in Residence 
Program (STIR) to help develop a 
streamlined, web-based registration 
process, freeing up staff to spend more 
time on program development and 
community outreach.  

NERT is a free training program for 
individuals, neighborhood groups and 
community-based organizations run by 
the San Francisco Fire Department. The 
program teaches community members 
the basics of personal preparedness, 
as well as the hands-on disaster skills 
necessary to assist the Fire Department 
in responding to all levels of emergencies. 
The program was born of proven 
necessity. During the magnitude-6.9 
1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, which 
shook a significant portion of the Marina 
District to the ground, San Franciscans 
immediately took to the streets to help 
their neighbors. This program, with its 
27,000 residents trained since 1990, 
builds on that tradition of neighbors 
helping neighbors.

Build a More Complete First Response After a Disaster

The Department of Public Health (DPH) 
will continue to work with NERT to train 
volunteers on psychological first aid, 
building a more comprehensive response 
after a disaster. After a disaster, many 
members of our community will be in 
crisis. To build back quickly, and stronger, 
our neighbors will need a helping hand 
to get back on their feet. With this in 
mind, in 2015 DPH worked with the 

nonprofit San Francisco Community Agencies Responding to Disasters 
(SFCARD) to develop a Psychological First Aid Training curriculum that 
was piloted as a Train the Trainers Psychological First Aid Training for 
NERT volunteers. This training will roll out to new neighborhoods in the 
coming months as part of a comprehensive outreach program.

“As an immigrant, San Francisco represents  
a safe harbor—a place where diversity and 
differences are not seen as challenges, but rather 
assets that strengthen the community.”

INITIATIVE  1.4

Expand Access to Health Facilities and 
Services for Our Most in Need

The City will invest $350 million to expand 
access to mental health services for 
San Franciscans, including the homeless, 
and seismically upgrade and strengthen 
the City’s public health care facilities 
and emergency medical response 
infrastructure to ensure their viability after 
a major earthquake. Specifically, the funds 
will be spent on additional earthquake 
safety upgrades to the San Francisco 
General Hospital, on neighborhood 
health clinics, on expanding services at 
homeless shelters, and on retrofitting Fire 
Department and ambulance facilities.   

This work builds on existing efforts to 
repair and strengthen our City’s health 
care and emergency medical services 
infrastructure, as outlined in the City’s 
10-Year Capital Plan. Protecting public 
health, expanding mental health and 

homeless services, and improving 
community safety in the event of an 
emergency are major focal points 
for aiding in our City’s recovery. By 
upgrading these health and safety 
facilities, San Francisco can help protect 
our residents, neighborhoods and small 
businesses. 

INITIATIVE  1.5

Develop a Long-Term Recovery 
Governance Plan 

Most major urban areas have established 
emergency response protocols. After 
a disaster, however, cities often have 
problems bridging the gap between 
response and long-term recovery. By 
2018, San Francisco will create a long-
term plan that lays out both a vision and 
goals aimed at effective and inclusive 
governance, cost recovery, strategic 
partnerships, data collection and overall 
planning for the City. 

This governance and cost-recovery 
strategic plan will assess the City’s 
current policies, procedures, authorities 
and tools, identifying what works, what’s 
missing and what needs to be modified. 
The aim is to best position the City to 
fully and quickly recover its eligible post-
disaster expenses. Post-disaster cost 
recovery is complex and spans far beyond 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency’s Public Assistance Program, 
including interaction with over 50 
different funding sources. City operations 
are also a complex matter day to day. This 
plan aims to ensure San Franciscans have 
the services they need as they get back 
on their feet.

INITIATIVE  1.6

Actively Coordinate for Recovery 
with Our Private and Public Utilities

The Office of Resilience and Recovery will partner with the 
San Francisco Lifelines Council to continue to study the geographic 
“choke point” areas, where infrastructure restoration is more 
challenging because of heavy concentration and interdependency. 
The Lifelines Council will also continue to enhance the coordination of 
disaster planning and preparedness efforts among lifeline providers—
those that supply the City with its most critical services (e.g., water, 
electricity and internet). At the same time, the Lifelines Council will 
continue to advance mitigation efforts that could collectively improve 
lifeline system performance in the City after future disasters. When the 
City Administrator’s Office initiated The Lifelines Council in 2009, it 
started an important dialogue. 

The Lifelines Council is made up of both private and public utility 
providers, first responders and senior public sector officials, who 
together work to ensure that our City and the region can recover 
quickly from unexpected disruptions. The Office of Resilience and 
Recovery will help the Council as it looks to complete implementation 
of its Five-Year Plan, including the efforts listed above, by 2019. 

“  Lifelines are the systems and facilities that 
provide services vital to the function of an 
industrialized society, and are important to the 
emergency response and recovery after a natural 
disaster. These systems and facilities include 
communication, electric power, liquid fuel, 
natural gas, transportation (airports, highways, 
ports, rail and transit), water and wastewater.”

City response and recovery with our private 
sector utility providers.

Advance Innovations in 
Earthquake Preparedness

The Bay Area is the intersection of some of the world’s top minds and talent, yet we face the risk 
of an earthquake every day. The natural result is a city that is constantly seeking new ways to 
think about, and protect us from, the risks that earthquakes pose to our homes, businesses 
and our communities. San Francisco will continue to embrace our proud tradition of 
inviting that innovation to flourish here to help protect us from these uncertainties as we 
approach SF@1M.

ASPIRATION: Advance earthquake preparedness through robust seismic 
mitigation, as well as community-based, intentional planning.

CAPSS Background

In the aftermath of 
the 1989 Loma Prieta 
Earthquake, the City 
launched the Community 
Action Plan for Seismic 
Safety (CAPSS) initiative. 
CAPSS provided City 

agencies and policymakers with a 
community-driven plan to reduce future 
earthquake risks in existing, privately 
owned buildings, and to develop repair 
and rebuilding guidelines to expedite 
recovery. Over the course of 10 years, 
the CAPSS project team—along with an 
advisory panel of over 60 stakeholders, 
community leaders, professional 

experts and City staff—met regularly to 
review and discuss the best methods 
to mitigate the potential for loss of life 
and property damage resulting from 
four potential earthquake scenarios. 
CAPSS built consensus around timelines 
for retrofitting, taking into account 
community feedback and feasibility. 
And it worked with the engineering 
community to reach a consensus on what 
types of damage would result from an 
expected earthquake to help level set the 
policy that is required to prepare the City 
for the next major earthquake.

ESIP and the Applied Technology Council

Strong and well-
established partnerships 
with the engineering and 
design communities are 
essential in advancing 
earthquake innovation. 
The City has partnered 
with the nonprofit Applied Technology 
Council (ATC) for more than a decade on 
building codes and earthquake-related 
policies, including the CAPSS study. 
ATC works with ESIP to take a broad, 
community-focused approach, bringing 
together a diverse group of stakeholders 
to form community advisory panels, 
which help ensure that the City’s seismic 
policies are representative of local 
concerns and needs. ESIP and ATC will 
examine seismic performance standards 
and policy recommendations focused 
on non-ductile concrete buildings, 
the earthquake readiness of our City’s 
commercial cores, among other areas of 
research.

The Applied Technology 
Council (ATC) is a nonprofit, 
tax-exempt corporation 
established in 1973 through 
the efforts of the Structural 
Engineers Association of 
California. ATC’s mission 
is to develop and promote 
state-of-the-art, user-friendly 
engineering resources 
and applications for use 
in mitigating the effects 
of natural disasters and 
other hazards on the built 
environment. ATC also 
identifies and encourages 
needed research, and 
develops consensus opinions 
on structural engineering 
issues in a nonproprietary 
format. ATC thereby fulfills 
a unique role in funded 
information transfer.

Mitigate Earthquake Risk 
through the Building Code

Damage to privately owned buildings is one of the 
greatest hazards resulting from a major earthquake. To 
build new buildings better and to prepare our existing 
homes, offices, shops and other structures for an 
earthquake, we need to reform our building code to 
require higher standards for building safety and post-
earthquake reoccupancy. ESIP will work with a coalition 
of City officials, design professionals and community 
members to amend the San Francisco Building Code 
by 2018 to require higher standards for new buildings, 
considering not only basic safety, but also post-disaster 
usage and occupancy. 

Building codes exist to set the minimum standard for 
buildings in a city. San Francisco, like many cities in 
California, has a long history of progressively amending 
the code to respond to local needs and pressing 
challenges. 

Developing sound policies that address both earthquake 
risk and the building code’s real-life impact on 
San Franciscans requires a combination of expert-led 
technical development and community input. Tenant 
displacement, parking issues and financing options, in 
addition to earthquake damage risk reduction, were all 
considered when previous code changes were adopted. 
New code advancements will follow this tradition.

The 181 Fremont Tower was 
designed to significantly exceed 
code standards and is expected 
to be reoccupiable directly after a 
large earthquake.

Streamline the 
Process to Quickly 
Re-occupy Our 
Buildings 

The Office of Resilience and Recovery, 
The Department of Building Inspection 
(DBI), Public Works (PW) and Emergency 
Management will collaborate with the 
Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation to build 
a post-earthquake building inspection 
tool, speeding up the building inspection 
and permitting process following an 
earthquake. Developed as part of the 
Startup in Residence Program (STIR), 
this tool will enable buildings to be 
quickly assessed, and then repaired and 
reoccupied, getting residents back in their 
homes easier and sooner. It builds off an 
existing and long-used paper process, 
called ATC-20, a rapid, in-field inspection 
tool that categorizes buildings with the 
familiar red, yellow and green tags. The 
tool, which will be ready for testing next 
year, will help San Francisco get back on 
its feet quickly—allowing for fast data 
collection, as well as tracking of citywide 
damage. 

In 2015, these departments held a joint 
exercise with the Office of the City 
Administrator and the Office of the 
Controller. This exercise simulated a 
massive earthquake striking San Francisco 
City Hall, with a full evacuation of the 
building and a mock-damage building 
inspection. This exercise built on the 
training of DBI and DPW staff. These 
experiences are critical to improving 
processes and procedures and to not 
only building an institutional culture 
of preparedness but also testing and 
improving processes and procedures. 
The Office of Resilience and Recovery will 
work with the relevant departments to 
hold additional exercises.  

“ The ATC-20-1 field manual, published by the Applied Technology 
Council (ATC), is a concise, easy-to-use field reference document that 
professionals trained in the methodology set forth in ATC-20, Procedures 
for Postearthquake Safety Evaluation of Buildings, can take into damaged 
areas for safety evaluation of buildings.”

Statewide Early Earthquake 
Warning System

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)—along with the University of 
California-Berkeley, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the 
Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and others—is developing a 
groundbreaking earthquake early-warning system called ShakeAlert for 
the West Coast of the United States. This technology detects the first 
wave sent out by an earthquake, which causes no ground motion but 
can nonetheless be detected and reported back to users, warning them 
vital seconds ahead of an earthquake. The technology is already being 
tested with San Francisco and other cities throughout California. It is 
critical that we advance this technology further here in San Francisco, 
and build on the statewide and regional network to create a more 
earthquake prepared California.

Implement San Francisco 2050 

The San Francisco Planning Department released its five-year work 
plan in 2015. The plan put forward strategies for short-term actions and 
long-term results, honing in on four key challenges and aspirations for 
San Francisco: remaining an equitable and inclusive city; access and 
mobility; resiliency and long-term sustainability; and placemaking. The 
plan approaches these key challenges and aspirations through five 
strategic place-based initiatives: 

■■ The Heart of San Francisco—seeking to inspire design for our city’s 

public realm; 

■■ A Resilient Waterfront—considering access to and growth along the 

waterfront, and the threat of sea level rise;  

■■ Next Generation SF—seeking to shape and connect the growth in 

Southeast San Francisco;

■■ A City of Neighborhoods—looking at the diverse and distinct 

character of our City’s neighborhoods; and

■■ Bridging the Bay—collaborating across the Bay to develop a shared 

vision. 

The five-year work program closely aligns with the goals of this 
strategy, building a strategic vision for San Francisco’s future, 
considering the threats we face and the reality of growth as we look to 
SF@1M. The Office of Resilience and Recovery will support the Planning

more connected, that we address new and growing neighborhoods 
and job centers, and that we carefully consider and work to address 
the impacts that displacement and lack of affordability will continue to 
have on quality of life. Specifically, this process considers investment 
choices the City will be making, such as regional connections via BART, 
Caltrain, future High Speed Rail, improvements in local transportation, 
state of good repair and capacity expansion, and others.

The Transportation Vision will inform some of San Francisco’s biggest 
policy questions. It will advance transportation improvements aimed 
at addressing congestion, getting ahead of fast growth and its impact 
on our city, and recognize the need to improve transit capacity.

The Hub—Linking Transit and 
Affordable Housing

From the 1880s through the 1950s, the area of San Francisco near 
the intersections of Market Street with Valencia, Haight and Gough 
streets was a distinct, well-known neighborhood called the “Market 
Street Hub,” or simply “The Hub.” The name was likely derived from 
the convergence of streetcar lines carrying people from outlying 
neighborhoods to downtown San Francisco. As we look to SF@1M, 
areas of the city like The Hub, where a deliberate choice has been made 
Performing Arts 
Parking Garage
to ensure that the area’s growth supports the City’s goals for housing, 
transportation, the public realm and the arts, will be critical.

Continue Building and Rebuilding 
Infrastructure 

San Francisco is committed to continually improving 
its infrastructure, knowing that it is essential to both 
the pressures of a growing city and the disruptions 
of emergencies large and small. The $32 billion FY 
2016-2025 Capital Plan continues San Francisco’s 
commitment to protecting its regional and Citywide 
infrastructural assets with large-scale improvements 
to the water delivery and wastewater systems, and the San Francisco 
International Airport. These efforts are critical to prepare our City for a 
strong earthquake and to increase our ability to handle the day-to-day 
challenges of a growing city. 

In 2006, after decades of underfunding infrastructure, the City 
created its first Citywide, comprehensive, 10-year Capital Plan. The 
City has since received over $3 billion in voter-approved bonds for 
(1) earthquake safety and emergency response facilities, including a 
new Level 1 Trauma Center Hospital at the SFGH campus, a new Public 
Safety Building, and new Medical Examiner and Crime Lab facilities; 
(2) transportation, road and street structure enhancements to improve 
public transit, pedestrian, bike, and vehicle mobility and safety; (3) park 
and open space improvements to address failing infrastructure, trees, 
restrooms and related facilities; and (4) bonds to fund additional low- 
and moderate-income housing.

SUPPORTING INITIATIVE  1.13

Continue to Push for 
Livable Streets

As the city grows and continues to serve as a job hub for the region, 
we must push for more livable and safer streets, with the goal of 
zero traffic fatalities by 2024. Vision Zero SF is the City’s road safety 
policy that will build safety and livability into our streets, protecting 
our city’s 1 million residents. Every year in San Francisco, about 30 
people lose their lives while traveling on city streets, and over 200 
more are seriously injured. These deaths and injuries are unacceptable 
and preventable. In 2014, the City committed to build better and safer 
streets, to educate the public on traffic safety, to enforce traffic laws 
and to adopt policy changes that save lives. Vision Zero SF will become 
increasingly critical as the City moves closer to SF@1M. That’s why we 
must continue the work to create a culture that prioritizes traffic safety 
and ensures that mistakes on our roads don’t end in serious injuries 
or death.

Introduction

To build the San Francisco of the future, we must address our City’s 
vulnerabilities today. From retrofitting seismically weak buildings to 
mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases, to adapting to the reality 
of rising seas and a changing climate, there is much we must do to 
achieve the goal of a sustainable future.

Our City has a proud history of tackling major challenges head-on. And 
our response to climate change and the ever-present threat of a large 
earthquake is no exception. But as we look forward to SF@1M, how can 
we build a better and more prepared San Francisco? How can we help 
our City handle the challenges of today and, at the same time, prepare 
for the challenges of tomorrow? 

KEY INDICATORS

To measure progress, San Francisco will:

■■ Retrofit the homes of 180,000 San Franciscans by 2025.

■■ Reach our greenhouse gas reduction goals by 2025, through 

zero waste, 50 percent of all trips on sustainable transportation and 
100 percent renewable sources of energy.

■■ Complete a disaster-resilient waterfront by 2040.

 

“ Among all of its greatness, San Francisco leads the world in 
seismic safety policy; always has. Earthquake science and 
engineering were born here, and the Bay Area community has 
never stopped delivering pace-setting advances. Many of the 
key ideas about community resilience coalesced here, and the 
programs that resulted are setting the standard for communities 
worldwide. For an earthquake engineer like me, there is no better 
place to practice, learn, invent, and create solutions and policies 
that improve the safety and well-being of the people everywhere.”

Retrofit Our Remaining 
Seismically Dangerous 
Buildings

San Francisco has long understood the need to strengthen seismically vulnerable buildings. In the 
face of critical day-to-day challenges, we must build on this legacy and continue to upgrade 
buildings to become more resistant to earthquakes. Not all earthquake-prone buildings 
are the same. Some are vulnerable based on characteristics indicative of a particular 
construction type, while others are vulnerable because they house particularly sensitive 
or mission-critical occupancies. Some are owned publicly, some privately, which 
means there is no one-size-fits-all approach to retrofitting dangerous buildings. 
It requires a dynamic and thoughtful approach. San Francisco will continue to 
lead the country with our seismic mitigation programs.

ASPIRATION: Reduce or fully mitigate earthquakes’ damage to our 
City’s public and privately held buildings.

Mandatory Retrofit Program

What Is It?

The  Mandatory  Soft  Story  Ordinance  requires 
the retrofit of wood-framed, soft story multi-unit, 
residential  buildings  with  two  or  more  stories 
over a soft story or under floor area and contain 
five  or  more  dwelling  units  permitted 
for 
construction prior to January 1, 1978. 
Soft  story  buildings  are  buildings  where  the 
bottom story is weaker than the stories above, 
leaving the building at a high risk for collapse in 
an earthquake. These buildings were identified 
as a great risk to public safety and the resilience 
of San Francisco by the CAPSS Study.
The CAPSS study or Community Action Plan for 
Seismic  Safety,  was  a  ten-year  analysis  to 
understand,  describe,  and  mitigate    the  risks 
San Francisco faces  to earthquakes. The study 
also included a community and expert created 
plan to address this risk. That plan became the 
Earthquake  Safety  Implementation  Program 
(ESIP). This ordinance is one of the tasks of the 
ESIP 30 year plan.
This ordinance is designed to both make San 
Franciscans  safer  and  make  San  Francisco 
more resilient in the next earthquake. 

The  program  began  by  issuing  notices  with  a 
screening form to all buildings that are found in 
City records to be within the scope (seen right) 
of the ordinance. The owner must then retain a 
design professional to complete the screening 
form,  which  will  determine  if  the  building  is 
actually within the program and, if so, which tier 
the building is within. 
At that point the owner must obtain a building 
permit  and  retrofit  their  building,  meeting  the 
engineering  standards  within  the  ordinance  in 
the amount of time their tier allows (below). 
Buildings with previous retrofit work that meets 
the level of the ordinance standards will not be 
required to retrofit. And, the ordinance exempts 
a building for 15 years once the work has been 
completed.
The cost of this work is permitted by the Rent 
Ordinance to be passed through to tenants. For 
residents 
financial 
hardship,  please  contact  the  Rent  Board  at 
415-252-4600.

ment of Building Inspection at 415-581-6699

FEATURED PROJECT

The Mandatory Soft Story 
Retrofit Program

In 2013, the Mayor and the Board of 
Supervisors unanimously approved 
legislation requiring the retrofit 
of 5,000 of San Francisco’s most 
seismically vulnerable buildings. These 
buildings—two-plus-story, wood-
framed structures built before 1978 
that contain five or more residential units—are all “soft story” buildings. 
Soft story buildings contain large openings on the ground level, either 
from garage openings or from large windows for neighborhood-serving 
businesses. These large openings leave soft story buildings susceptible 
to severe damage, or even collapse, in the event of an earthquake. 

Soft story buildings, which house roughly 180,000 San Franciscans, 
make up a significant portion of our City’s rent-controlled housing 
stock, and contain many beloved, neighborhood-serving businesses. 
The Mandatory Soft Story Retrofit Program, administered between 
the ESIP and the Department of Building Inspection, hosted a 
comprehensive and culturally competent outreach program, with 
customer service-based technical and financial assistance. These efforts 
included an Earthquake Retrofit Fair, trailing legislation aimed at easing 
renter and landlord compliance, and a series of informational mailers. 
The program currently boasts a near 100 percent compliance rate.

Older non-ductile concrete 
buildings were constructed 
using more brittle material, 
making them hazardous in an 
earthquake. 

INITIATIVE  2.2 

Evaluate and Retrofit Our 
Non‑Ductile Concrete Buildings

ESIP will call for the evaluation of all non-ductile concrete buildings 
starting in 2020. And it will call for retrofitting these buildings by 2030. 
Non-ductile concrete buildings were built before modern building 
codes, leaving them susceptible to extreme damage or even collapse 
in the event of an earthquake. Many non-ductile concrete buildings 
have high occupancies; in a modeled repeat of the 1906 earthquake, a 
large proportion of the deaths and serious injuries were attributed to 
the collapse of non-ductile concrete buildings. The Concrete Coalition 
at the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute estimates there are 
3,200 of these buildings in San Francisco. ESIP is currently working with 
the Applied Technologies Council (ATC), as seen in Chapter 1 of this 
Strategy, to determine collapse prevention retrofit criteria.

INTEGRATION

The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles have been working together 
to address the unique needs of urban areas facing earthquake risk. The 
San Francisco Earthquake Safety Implementation Program consulted with 
LA Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office in the 12 months leading up to their release 
of Resilience By Design—LA’s roadmap for earthquake resilience.

Retrofit Our Most Hazardous 
Publicly Owned Buildings 

Under the City Administrator, the Capital Planning Program reviews 
and prioritizes 10-Year Capital Plan projects and coordinates funding. 
The City and County of San Francisco have completed over 200 
earthquake-related improvements, including total replacements of 
public facilities in the nearly 27 years since the Loma Prieta Earthquake 
struck on October 17, 1989. We must continue this work in the coming 
years as we prepare our City for the next major earthquake. The 
program upgrades range from small but critical pump stations and 
transmission mains to large-scale, essential facilities like police and 
fire stations, and the 911 Emergency Operations Center. The 10-year 
Capital Plan also prioritizes retrofits for signature properties, such as 
the San Francisco General Hospital Level 1 Trauma Center Hospital, 
Public Safety Building, City Hall; the Ferry Building; the Main Library; 
the Veteran’s War Memorial and Opera buildings, Academy of Sciences, 
Asian Art and DeYoung Museums; and the International Terminal, 
Terminal 2 and the Main Control Tower at SFO.

Originally completed in 1932, the 
War Memorial Veterans Building 
was where President Harry S. 
Truman and other heads of state 
signed the United Nations Charter 
in 1945. Through OneSF, this historic 
resource underwent a seismic 
retrofit, systems were upgraded to 
be more energy-efficient, and safety 
features like sprinkler and fire alarm 
systems were added.

FEATURED PROJECT
San Francisco General Hospital 
Level 1 Trauma Center

San Francisco General Hospital’s Level 1 Trauma Center was constructed 
using a seismic base-isolated foundation, making it one of the most 
earthquake-resistant buildings in the nation. During an earthquake, the 
base isolators under the building can slide 30 inches in any direction, 
greatly reducing movement of the building. This technology is the best 
way to ensure the hospital can remain operational after a significant 
seismic event. Reducing 3,000 tons of steel from the structure, 
combined with the material and energy conserved in not having to 
perform extensive repairs or replace the building after an earthquake, 
earned the trauma center an Innovation in Design credit toward its 
LEED certification. It is estimated that our isolated building design 
represents a savings of about $10 million, compared to a fixed-base 
structural frame.

The Retrofund: Expand Financing 
Programs That Build Resilience 

The City recently expanded its 
Property Assessed Clean Energy 
(PACE) Program to create a 
new financing initiative to help 
property owners make seismic and environmentally conscious building 
improvements. One property at a time, this program will make our city 
a greener and safer community. Program benefits include:

■■ 100 percent financing of hard and soft costs

■■ Financing for seismic retrofits and seismic strengthening

■■ Energy-efficiency, water conservation and renewable energy projects 

may be financed

■■ Expansions of the program are being made to include disabled 

access improvements for commercial storefronts

■■ Competitive fixed rates and repayment terms of up to 30 years

■■ Approval based on the property’s equity, not the applicant’s 

credit score

■■ Financing is tied to the property and can be transferred to a new 

owner upon sale 

■■ Property owner keeps any applicable federal/state rebates and/or 

tax credits

■■ Payments are made through the property’s tax bill as a 

special assessment

After an extensive selection process, the City partnered with 
AllianceNRG to provide fixed rate loans. Borrowers are required to 
comply with the Mandatory Soft Story Retrofit program.

Improvement 
Program

The San Francisco Public Utilities 
Commission’s (SFPUC) Sewer System 
Improvement Project (SSIP) is a 20-year, 
multibillion-dollar Citywide investment in 
upgrading our aging sewer infrastructure. 
Costly emergency and routine repairs 
are not sufficient to keep pace with our 
100-year-old, seismically vulnerable 
system, and the longer upgrades are 
delayed, the more expensive they 
become. For example, we should update 
our sewer system to withstand intense 
rainstorms, which occur with greater 
frequency as a result of climate change. 
Sewer system upgrades like this are 
essential to the overall vitality of our City’s 
public health, the environment and our 
ability to recovery after a disaster. 

With the completion of the Sutro 
Reservoir Retrofit Program in 2015, 
San Francisco finalized its $4.8 billion 
Water System Improvement Program 
(WSIP). WSIP was a multi-year capital 
program to upgrade the San Francisco 
Public Utilities Commission’s regional 
and local water systems, enhancing 
the agency’s ability to provide reliable, 
affordable, high-quality drinking water in 
an environmentally sustainable manner 
to 2.6 million people in the Bay Area. 
The program, which has increased 
safety and daily service, consisted of 
83 projects—35 local projects within 
San Francisco and 48 regional projects 
spread over seven counties.

deliver water at much higher pressures and use unlimited water 
from the Bay. The auxiliary system is our last line of defense 
in a fire after an earthquake. The system is also used by the 
San Francisco Fire Department to increase service capacity in 
response  m, providing critical firefighting water to areas in need.

Waterfront Seawall, or Great Seawall, stabilizes over three miles of 
historic waterfront and hundreds of acres of filled land stretching from 
Fisherman’s Wharf to Mission Creek. This area includes significant 
Port and City assets, such as the Historic Piers, Ferry Building, 
Embarcadero Promenade and roadway, Ferry & Cruise Terminals, BART 
Transbay Tube, MUNI light rail and utility infrastructure. The high-level 
study, which is nearly complete, will assess earthquake vulnerability, 
predict damage and economic impacts from a range of earthquake 
events, develop conceptual mitigation alternatives, and make 
recommendations for further action and study. This information will 
inform the Port’s Strategic Plan, as well as its efforts to improve lifeline 
resiliency, and respond to climate change and sea level rise.

Lead the World in  
Greenhouse Gas Mitigation

San Francisco has dramatically reduced its greenhouse gas emissions. The City’s carbon 
footprint is now 14.5 percent below 1990 levels, even though our economy and population 
have grown considerably. 

And yet, we are committed to doing even better. San Francisco’s Climate Action 
Strategy shows how the City can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 
25 percent below 1990 levels by 2017 and 40 percent below by 2025. In 
San Francisco, we know that climate change is real, and we are focused on 
not only preparing for its effects, but mitigating our City’s impacts on 
the global environment. The initiatives below will help San Francisco 
achieve its ambitious climate goals.

ASPIRATION: To meet our climate mitigation goals in new and 
innovative ways.

Actively Plan  
for Climate Change 
at Every City 
Department

If you don’t measure it, you can’t mitigate 
it. That’s why San Francisco requires 
every City department to track and 
report greenhouse gas emissions in 
annual Departmental Climate Action 
Plans. Departments look at vehicle 
fuel and building energy usage, water 
usage and employee practices related 
to waste, transportation and purchasing. 
This process helps departments identify 
how to improve operations, reduce their 
carbon footprints and address climate 
change.

The San Francisco Environment engages 
City departments in the climate action 
planning process by providing data 
and best practices on environmental 
policies to departmental climate liaisons. 
These climate liaisons then conduct 
outreach and education to spearhead 
organizational change.

Fund Innovative 
Emission Reduction 

Through the San Francisco Carbon Fund, 
the City offsets municipal travel-related 
greenhouse gas emissions by investing 
in projects that reduce emissions within 
the City and County of San Francisco. 
Conferences and conventions in 
San Francisco may also contribute to the 
fund to offset event-related emissions. 
For example, the City currently invests 
approximately 13 percent of employee 
airfare related to City business in 
greenhouse gas-reducing projects, such 
as the creation of new urban parks and 
community gardens, the planting of 
trees and drought-resistant vegetation, 
and the restoration of native habitats 
and corridors. The Fund has already 
made a huge difference across our city, 
financing projects that have improved 
neighborhood walkability, created new 
community gathering spaces, reduced 
stormwater runoff and erosion, and 
sequestered carbon. 

FEATURED PROJECT
The Civic Center 
Sustainable Utilities 
District Plan

San Francisco’s historic Beaux Arts Civic Center is the seat of San Francisco’s City 
government and home to its major cultural institutions. Visited daily by thousands, 
it serves both as a busy neighborhood park and as a staging ground for major City 
events, such as parades, demonstrations and festivals. The Civic Center Sustainable 
Utilities District Plan presents a long-term vision for promoting sustainability within 
this high-visibility area, while also bolstering its resilience to climate change, drought 
and catastrophic events. 

The District Plan aims to: 

■■ Reduce potable water consumption, 

and treat and reuse water on-site; 

■■ Generate electricity on-site using green 

technology; 

■■ Support an appealing public realm; 

■■ Incorporate emergency readiness into 

site planning activities; and 

■■ Provide education and outreach on 

sustainability concepts.

The core of the District Plan is the 
development of district-scale sustainable 
utilities systems that would collect, treat, 
and reuse wastewater and nuisance 
groundwater. Energy generated from solar 
panels and waste materials would feed an 
energy loop that would allow for water 
and energy savings, and a dramatically 
reduced impact on the environment. 
On-site stormwater management 
strategies would reduce the burden on 
the City’s sewer system, while improving 
the appearance and function of public 
streets, sidewalks and other outdoor 
spaces.

Support Urban Watershed  
Planning

The Urban Watershed Assessment (UWA) looks at our City’s eight 
urban watersheds through the evaluation-based lens used by the 
SFPUC to plan the City’s Sewer System Improvement Program 
(SSIP), the City’s 20-year, multibillion-dollar effort to improve the 
collections portion of our combined sewer system. Weighing the unique 
characteristics of each of the City’s eight urban watersheds, such as soil 
type, underlying geology, age of infrastructure and urban development 
patterns, the watershed assessment promotes progressive solutions. 
UWA recommendations will include a blend of innovative green (rain 
gardens, permeable pavement, bioswales) and traditional grey (tunnels, 
pump stations, upstream conveyance pipes) infrastructure projects, 
incentive programs and policies to meet our sewer system challenges. 
The recommendations will shape the next generation of sewer 
improvements to provide a compliant, reliable, resilient and flexible 
system that can respond to catastrophic events, manage stormwater 
and flooding, adapt to climate change, and provide community benefits 
and environmental sustainability.

Energy Assurance—San Francisco 
Solar + Storage for Resiliency

With support from the U.S. Department of Energy Sunshot Initiative 
and the Solar Market Pathways Program, San Francisco is planning for 
emergency backup power systems that will contribute to the City’s 
Climate Action goals by using on-site solar energy. The systems will also 
provide an emergency source of energy during a disaster by having 
on-site energy storage. This project evaluates both the technical and 
financial feasibility of identifying priority sites, determining critical 
power needs, sizing the system for maximum benefit, and exploring 
cost and financing models. This process will be implemented through 
the creation of “disaster preparedness zones,” including critical power 
linkages in key disaster response facilities such as city buildings, 
recreations centers, libraries and others buildings.

Adapt Our Transportation System

Our transportation system is a critical lifeline for our City’s families 
and workers. But potential future impacts from climate change pose 
a significant risk to San Francisco’s public transit system, its critical 
assets and facilities, and the broader transportation system. In recent 
years, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) has 
been focused on making San Francisco’s multimodal transportation 
system stronger in the face of both current and future climate impacts, 
such as sea level rise and coastal storms. This work builds on SFMTA’s 
long history as a national leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
SFMTA’s Sustainability Program is working with colleagues throughout 
the agency, and partner departments in the city and region, to increase 
the resiliency of the transportation system and to advance an array of 
climate adaptation projects. 

SFMTA is working to update its Climate Action Strategy, which 
will include:

■■ a new climate adaptation section; 

■■ a sea level rise vulnerability assessment to identify systemwide 

vulnerabilities;

■■ a capital planning and resiliency/sustainability pilot project that 

aims to ensure transportation investments take into account climate 
change; and

■■ an El Niño/Winter Weather Plan to guide SFMTA operations in the 

event of coastal flooding and storm impacts. 

These four pioneering projects will ultimately help increase the 
resiliency of the transportation system against future climate impacts. 

 “  I love San Francisco because it embraces 

sustainability, creativity and people from all over 
the world—and all walks of life. It has always been 
the home to those dreaming of a better world, 
and inventing the path to get there. Its whimsical 
topography, fresh salty air and water all around are 
a joy to experience on foot, bike or surfboard. And 
our tolerant, diverse, curious and environmentally

GOAL 3: Ensure Housing for San Franciscans Today and After a Disaster

Introduction

Eighty-five thousand residential units could be permanently lost in 
an earthquake. After a disaster, we will need to scale up the existing 
processes we use to house our residents in need. This impact can be 
reduced if we position the resources we need to improve these systems 
today. The 1906 earthquake and fire destroyed more than 28,000 
buildings and left 225,000 people homeless. Disasters complicate existing 
challenges in a way that can hinder long-term recovery. As we plan for 
SF@1M, we need to think about access to housing that is both affordable 
and can withstand a major disaster. That’s why the City is focused on 
protecting housing for all San Franciscans now—to help us be stronger 
and more prepared for the uncertainties of the future. 

KEY INDICATORS:

To measure progress, San Francisco will:

■■ Create the capacity to house 95 percent of our residents in the City 

after a disaster.

■■ Improve new and existing systems to house 8,000 homeless 

San Franciscans by 2020.

■■ Produce 30,000 housing units by 2020, of which 30 percent will 
be permanently affordable and 50 percent will be middle-income 
housing.  

■■ Create capacity to house a population expected to grow to 1 million 

residents by 2040. 

 

The tools and systems we 
use to feed, care for and 
house our residents today 
will need to scale up after 
a disaster.

Potential damage to residential 
units in a 7.2 earthquake on the 
San Andreas Fault 

A robust and inclusive housing recovery after a major 
disaster starts with keeping residents in their homes 
or getting them back home as quickly as possible.

INITIATIVE  3.1

Establish a Post-Disaster Interim  
Housing Strategy 

Keep San Franciscans in San Francisco after a Disaster

The Office of Resilience and Recovery, in partnership with the Department 
of Emergency Management, will expand the City’s All-Hazards Response 
and Restoration Plan, detailing the coordination, roles and responsibilities 
of responding agencies, and how the City will work with state and federal 
partners during an emergency. After an interdepartmental community 
engagement process, the strategy will be released in 2018.

It is critical to recovery that we keep our residents in the City after a major 
disaster. We must therefore create a thorough and dynamic plan to provide 
temporary shelters, keeping residents in the City, while quickly enabling 
building owners to make repairs. Speedy repairs will allow residents to return 
to their homes as quickly as possible. We have developed a three-point 
strategy to ensure a quick, effective and inclusive housing recovery:

Shelter in Home

Shelter in Village

Shelter in City

If residents remaining in their 
homes or on the site of their 
homes is not possible, the next 
best option is to shelter in 
village, where the residents live 
temporarily in a new location 
within the neighborhood. This 
causes minimal disruption 
to the residents’ lives as 
their unit is repaired, while 
maintaining work, school, local 
amenities and neighborhood 
relationships—facilitating a 
speedy recovery.

Our top priority is keeping 
San Franciscans in their city. If 
it is not possible for residents 
to remain in their home or 
their neighborhood, this 
strategy would keep them in 
the city at shelter and housing 
sites. This will minimize 
economic damage, facilitate 
rebuilding and help prevent 
one of the most destructive 
ills of post-disaster cities—
population loss.

The best outcome for residents 
after a disaster is the ability 
to remain in their homes. 
Residential units will likely be 
damaged, so this may take the 
form of mobile housing units 
on or close to the site of the 
homes or living in a relatively 
safe, though damaged, unit. 
Through a Shelter First Repair 
Program, repairs can be 
made quickly with the goal 
of reoccupying the homes 
as soon as possible. Special 
attention should be paid to 
the multifamily structures 
that house approximately 
70 percent of San Franciscans.

Create a Disaster Recovery 
Case Management Program 
and Database

The Office of Resilience and Recovery, in partnership with the 
Department of Public Health and the Human Services Agency, will 
form a Disaster Recovery Case Management Program. The program 
will develop a comprehensive and user-friendly database to help 
case managers provide assistance through close cooperation with 
organizations currently serving vulnerable populations. This program 
will also maintain a Citizens Advisory Recovery Committee to establish 
an appropriate database platform, oversee the program, and serve as 
an advisory and oversight body during San Francisco’s recovery. After 
a disaster, typically only 80 percent of those needing assistance will be 
able to navigate the process easily, 15 percent will require more case 
management and 5 percent will require detailed assistance. Because of 
unique challenges and issues faced by many of San Francisco’s most 
vulnerable residents, this program, which launches in 2017, becomes all 
the more critical to our recovery.

Learning from Network Cities: 
New Orleans

To help facilitate the rebuilding of the Broadmoor neighborhood 
in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor 
Development Corporation created its own database. Under 
the leadership of Howard Roark, interns and students built a 
Salesforce platform for cataloging the needs of the community’s 
7,000 residents. With the database, Roark could detail for 

donors where their money was going and get them in touch with the residents they 
were helping. It also allowed Roark to track outstanding repairs so, for example, when 
a plumber stopped by, that person could be directed to jobs that needed attention.

assessment helps the Office of Resilience 
and Recovery work with its partners to 
establish recovery planning for the City, 
and to better understand the health 
impacts of living in a damaged unit as 
repairs are conducted following a disaster. 

San Francisco will establish a Citizens 
Advisory Recovery Committee 
(Recover-SF) to provide a much-
needed connection between the city 
government and vulnerable populations 
served by assistance programs 
during recovery. This committee will 
be composed of representatives 
from service provider organizations, 
leadership from vulnerable population 
communities and City representatives. 
San Francisco will push to establish 
Recover-SF in 2016, as it will be 
instrumental in the development of the 
Disaster Recovery Case Management 
Program and database, in the planning 
of interim and transitional housing for 
vulnerable populations, in ensuring that

Quickly Repair and  
Reoccupy Our Housing Stock  
After a Disaster

In 2017, the Office of Resilience and Recovery will launch a program 
modeled after New York City’s Rapid Repairs Initiative under the FEMA 
STEP pilot program. New York’s Rapid Repairs Initiative facilitated basic 
and temporary repairs to homes, therefore allowed residents to quickly 
return to their homes after Hurricane Sandy. San Francisco’s ability to 
quickly reoccupy our housing will help the City accelerate its recovery 
by sourcing appropriate funding that can be reimbursed by the federal 
government. This can be accomplished by prenegotiating with qualified 
contractors and by easing or waiving habitability standards as needed. 

The Office of Resilience and Recovery, in partnership with community 
groups and organizations, such as the Voluntary Organizations Active in 
Disasters (VOADs), will initiate a culturally competent and multilingual 
outreach campaign. This communications campaign will utilize multiple 
channels and networks to explain programs and encourage enrollment,

Interim/Transitional Disaster Housing Framework:  
A Harvard Kennedy School and City of San Francisco 
Partnership

The Interim/Transitional Disaster Housing Framework 
is a theoretical and analytical plan created in 
consultation with the City by students, faculty 
and fellows of the Harvard Kennedy School. The 
Framework was written to assist the Office of Resilience and Recovery, 
and its partners, in planning for transitional housing needs in a post-
disaster setting. 

As the team carried out its research and analysis, it was tasked 
with maintaining the integrity of the City’s top priorities around 
repopulation and rebuilding after a large-scale disaster. They prioritized 
interim housing units’ proximity to the original residence, then to the 
neighborhood, and then, if neither option is available, somewhere 
within the City. The team also focused on rethinking and defining 
vulnerable populations, with a particular emphasis on identifying and 
addressing unmet needs. Finally, the team created scalable, flexible 
options that allow the City and individual neighborhoods to choose the 
right solutions for themselves and to feel included in the process.

Building the capacity 
now to quickly repair our 
housing will significantly 
accelerate recovery after 
a disaster. 

“Increased mitigation and planning for our 
long-term recovery is critical in preserving 
our beautiful, vibrant and diverse city.”

Thousands of our residents could be homeless after a major earthquake. The systems we use now 
give us a blueprint for scaling up the systems we use today to house homeless San Franciscans. 
Additionally, homeless residents will be disproportionately impacted by a disruption or 
disaster. In December 2015, Mayor Edwin M. Lee announced a plan to create a new 
Department to End Homelessness (not yet formally named). Bringing social services 
and housing resources under a single department provides focus and the ability to

and are considered among the hardest to rehouse. These populations 
include families with incomes less than 30 percent of the Area Median 
Income (AMI), victims of domestic violence and children with special 
needs and other complex cases that require additional care. RRH has 
proven to be successful, with 90 to 95 percent of the families remaining 
stably housed after the subsidy concludes. Innovative systems like this 
can be scaled up after a disaster to help house San Franciscans.

Strengthen Housing  
Now to Better Prepare Us  
for Tomorrow 

Housing remains one of the greatest challenges our City faces. We are a rapidly growing city—
approaching SF@1M—with new residents pressuring our existing housing stock, while demanding 
new housing units. The initiatives that support this action build on the ongoing efforts within 
the Mayor’s Office of Housing and the City to address our City’s housing crisis. The Office 
of Resilience and Recovery will support these actions through community education 
and the incorporation of these programs, and the issues they address, in recovery 
and disaster mitigation planning. 

ASPIRATION: San Francisco will increase our supply of housing, while 
helping our most vulnerable residents stay in their homes.

Fund the Construction of 
Affordable Housing

The City will launch a Housing Affordability Fund to leverage limited 
public dollars for housing, bringing financial, employer and other 
sources of capital to support efficient and timely site acquisition for 
affordable-housing construction, or the preservation of exiting at-risk 
affordable rental buildings. Given the steady decline in federal and state 
funding for affordable housing, the loss of redevelopment agencies and 
the increasing cost of producing affordable housing in San Francisco, it 
is clear that our existing funding streams are still not enough. This fund 
builds on the work of the Housing Trust Fund, the most aggressive local 
funding stream for affordable housing in California. 

INITIATIVE  3.10

INITIATIVE  3.11

Expand Access to 
Affordable Housing

The City will allow developers to 
“dial up” their current inclusionary 
requirements by providing a greater 
percentage or number of below-
market-rate units at a higher AMI target, 
with ownership units priced up to 120 
percent of AMI and rental units priced 
up to 90 percent. This allows for more 
middle-income residents—such as 
teachers, police officers and firefighters—
to access affordable housing. This 
diverse approach may also carry with it 
the benefit of maximizing the number of 
affordable units on the site.

Make New 
Developments 
More Affordable

The City will continue to develop an 
Affordable Housing Bonus Program, 
paving the way for construction of more 
affordable-housing units in San Francisco 
neighborhoods. In close coordination 
with members of the community, projects 
considered under this program will not 
demolish any existing residential units, 
will consider open space and other 
community amenities, and will receive 
a high level of review and authorization. 
This program provides incentives for 
developers to include more affordable 
housing for very low-, low-, moderate- 
and middle-income households, 
building diverse affordability into our 
neighborhoods and strengthening our 
housing stock.

Continue the Rental Assistance 
Demonstration Program

The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) 
program, supported by the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, seeks to preserve 
public housing by providing local housing authorities 
with access to a more stable funding source, so they 
can make needed repairs to their properties. The 
RAD program will allow San Francisco’s Housing 

Authority to access, for the first time, resources such as debt financing 
and low-income housing tax credits. These resources will help the 
housing authority complete its significant rehabilitation program and 
preserve the long-term viability of units. In addition to improvements, 
all buildings will have tenant engagement services and access to 
neighborhood resources. The plan will also provide for rigorous tenant 
protections and a right of return for residents who may need to move 
temporarily while their units are rehabilitated. 

The U.S. Congress—which funds public housing—has not provided 
local housing agencies with enough money for capital repairs. In 
San Francisco, public housing has more than $270 million in deferred 
capital repairs. This initiative green-lights over $500 million of repairs 
over the next three years for more than 4,500 distressed San Francisco 
Housing Authority units. Thirty-five hundred of the apartments will 
be rehabilitated as a portfolio, and converted to new ownership and 
property management by community-based, nonprofit affordable-
housing developers. The City is providing over $50 million toward the 
effort, which is in addition to the City funds dedicated to the HOPE SF 
work. On its own, it would take the San Francisco Housing Authority 
over 50 years to provide the kind of capital improvements that will now 
occur within three years.
 

INITIATIVE  3.12

Revive San Francisco’s 
Public Housing 

The HOPE SF Initiative seeks to transform 
four of San Francisco’s most distressed 
public housing sites into vibrant, thriving 
communities through holistic revitalization. 
In 2006, the City convened a taskforce, 
representing diverse perspectives, to 
develop a set of principles that would 

become the HOPE SF Initiative. This initiative has eight guiding visions, 
helping ensure a positive outcome for all residents:  

■■ Ensure No Loss of Public Housing

■■ Create an Economically Integrated Community

■■ Maximize the Creation of New Affordable Housing

■■ Involve Residents in the Highest Levels of Participation in the 

Entire Project

■■ Provide Economic Opportunities through the Rebuilding Process

Resilient San FranciscoGOAL 4: Empower Neighborhoods through Improved ConnectionsCity and County of San FranciscoIntroduction

San Francisco is a city of neighborhoods—each with its own distinct 
character, culture and challenges. This is key to the City’s identity 
and strength; protecting and empowering our neighborhoods is 
key to ensuring the City’s resilience. San Francisco will empower 
neighborhoods by connecting them to new resources, improving 
their access to and trust in City services, and creating meaningful 
connections with each other. 

Actions in this chapter harness what it means for residents and 
businesses to better connect to their City government and to each 
other. We need to replace inefficient systems with innovative solutions 
that empower San Franciscans. Better connectivity between the 
community and San Francisco government will allow us to strengthen 
existing bonds and forge new ones. These trusted relationships are 
essential to building strong neighborhoods. The Office of Resilience 
and Recovery will lead a Citywide effort to help strengthen our 
neighborhoods, prepare them for future disruptions, and enable them 
to connect better to each other and the services they need today.

KEY INDICATORS:

To measure progress, San Francisco will:

■■ Establish the Office of Resilience and Recovery under the City 

Administrator.

■■ Implement a modern user interface for all government services, with 

the goal of 90 percent of permitting done online by 2025.

■■ Launch community-level asset mapping in 29 San Francisco 

neighborhoods within 12 months.

■■ Reach 40,000 San Franciscans through a coordinated outreach 

process within 12 months.

The Office of Resilience and Recovery will partner with the 
San Francisco Public Libraries (SFPL) to conduct community 
outreach meetings at the City’s 29 libraries, building on the work 
already being done in the libraries to reimagine these neighborhood 
spaces as gathering sites. In 2014, with the completion of the North 
Beach branch rebuild project, the SFPL, in partnership with Friends 
of the San Francisco Public Library, completed its Branch Library 
Improvement Program, a multiyear, voter-approved upgrade of 
all library branches. Improvements included increased Internet 
connectivity, added community spaces and seismic retrofitting. The 
libraries moved from being places to sit in silence to places to gather, 
to learn and to grow as a neighborhood. ORR will work with the SFPL 
to continue developing this pilot program to build empowered and

Enhance Trust in Our Public 
Safety Officials 

Trust in public safety 
officials is essential 
during times of stress 
and uncertainty. 
When disaster strikes, 
effective response and 
recovery requires a 
strong trust and bond 

with our City’s first responders. Police officers, fire 
fighters and EMS, building inspectors, health inspectors 
and others will be on the front lines of San Francisco’s 
response. This approach encompasses actions aimed 
at helping the departments cope with the needs of a 
growing and changing City that is approaching SF@1M.

Forge Partnerships to Empower 
Neighborhoods 

The Office of Resilience and Recovery will work closely with the 
Invest in Neighborhoods program, run by the Office of Economic 
and Workforce Development, to identify and build partnerships that 
advance the goals of this strategy. Invest in Neighborhoods works to 
strengthen and revitalize neighborhood commercial districts around the 
City by marshaling and deploying resources from City departments and 
nonprofit partners. This includes services such as loan programs, façade 
improvement grants and technical assistance for small businesses, 
leveraging City services to help small businesses thrive, increase 
neighborhood quality of life, improve overall physical conditions and, in 
turn, build community capacity. 

Every neighborhood commercial district has its own unique needs, 
opportunities and challenges. Invest in Neighborhoods aims to deploy 
the specific services and resources that are most needed in each 
district, building stronger neighborhoods through strategic investment 
in each community’s core commercial corridor. By helping the City think 
holistically about a neighborhood’s needs, Invest in Neighborhoods 
makes important connections to support strong and resilient 
neighborhood corridors.

Empower Neighborhoods through 
Increased Capacity

The City will continue to partner with neighborhood and community 
leaders to empower individuals and their communities to build stronger, 
more connected and more resilient neighborhoods. The Neighborhood 
Empowerment Network (NEN) is a City partnership program with a 
coalition of residents, neighborhood organizations, nonprofits and 
faith-based institutions. Its mission is to empower residents through 
partnership and outreach, leveraging community assets to strengthen 
residents and their neighborhoods. NEN gives voice to communities 
and increases their capacity through events, resources and its annual 
NEN Awards, which honor valued community leaders.  

FEATURED PROJECT

Bayview Neighborhood 
Support Center

In times of crisis, communities lean on trusted institutions, service 
providers and faith-based organizations in their neighborhood or 
community. Community trust is critical, as those in need may not be as 
willing to engage with an outside institution that is unfamiliar with the 
community. Building empowered and resilient neighborhoods means 
leveraging existing community support channels, rather than creating 
competing or redundant organizations. 

Established in 2006 with a grant from the San Francisco Foundation, 
Providence Baptist Church and Foundation is an example of this kind 
of neighborhood-embedded organization. The Church partners with 
the San Francisco Community Agencies Responding to Disasters (SF 
CARD) to train staff and prepare the Church to become an anchor in 
its community for those in need. The Providence Foundation leveraged 
this training to build on the services offered at its 125-bed shelter to 
help homeless men in the community. This effort has expanded into 
additional facilities, such as a family shelter, a women’s shelter and a 
storage facility to keep belongings secure. Now the shelter guests can 
go to job interviews or get the services they need without worrying 
about the safety of their belongings. As an institution partnering with 
the City, the Bayview Neighborhood Support Center is also in a position 
to help provide support to neighborhood residents after a disaster.

culture of preparedness in our 
neighborhood to help support us

Bayview residents worked closely with City staff and Appallicious to 
develop San Francisco’s first daily-use Digital Community Resilience 
Platform. Through an extensive research and discovery process, 
the neighborhood identified its assets, vulnerabilities and critical 
stakeholders. The residents continue to use this tool to build a stronger 
community one day at a time, one task at a time, one crisis at a time. 
ORR and Appallicious will pilot a new community-level dashboard in 29 
neighborhoods as part of ORR’s strategic outreach partnership with the 
San Francisco Public Libraries.

Develop a Public Digital 
Service Strategy

The Digital Service Strategy is a commitment to create 
a better service experience for residents, visitors and 
businesses. Through strategic redesign, the City can build 
digital services that are accessible and easy to use. The 
City should build products that improve the consumer 
experience by emphasizing iterative design principles 
and user feedback. Key to realizing this shared vision will 
be assembling a digital services team of modern web 
technology experts and developing a culture that seeks to 
constantly improve services. In the coming years, the City 
will strategically transform service delivery by changing 
the ways we build and manage digital products. The 
City hopes to redefine its relationship with residents and 
visitors by becoming more responsive, and by providing 
accessible, easy-to-use services.

Improve Access to  
San Francisco Government

In good times and bad, residents and businesses must be able to rely on City services for support. 
Both residents and businesses feel the impacts of impeded access to City services. Improving 
this access will provide higher compliance, greater transparency and improved efficiency. 
San Francisco will continue to streamline and improve the ways in which residents and 
businesses interact with the City, making what is confusing, unclear or arduous quicker, 
more usable and more accessible to San Franciscans.

Receive and Issue Permits 
Electronically

To use public resources efficiently, to get housing built faster and to 
ready San Francisco for a quick and effective recovery, the City will 
put together an electronic permitting plan by 2018 and implement 
the program by 2020. Outdated permit processes result in inefficient 
and lengthy wait times, coupled with redundant review procedures, 
often confusing the applicant as to which step is next in the process. 
Residents and businesses need to have a clear picture of what is 
required from start to finish in any permit process. San Francisco has 
always been a hub of innovation. There is a powerful opportunity to 
embrace technology, and to provide transparency and efficiency with 
the implementation of an online electronic permitting system. 

INTEGRATION

City processes are becoming more digitally streamlined, allowing 
for better service now and a speedy recovery after a major disaster, 
because the systems can be supported from remote locations. After 
a disaster, in light of our interim housing goals of retaining 95 percent 
of our population and housing those residents largely in their homes 
or neighborhoods, we will need a fast, flexible and effective permitting 
system that meets user needs. This system provides benefits now and 
builds a stronger tomorrow.

Breaking down data by 
neighborhood empowers 
communities at a scale 
that can better meet their 
planning needs. 

FEATURED PROJECT 

Use Data to Empower Residents 

The SF Indicator Project is a neighborhood-level data system 
that measures how San Francisco performs in eight indicia of a 
healthy, equitable community. The goal of this project is to support 
collaboration, planning, decision making and advocacy for social and 
physical environments that meet the needs of all residents. This tool 
builds the capacity of individuals to understand the performance of 
their neighborhood in the face of multiple challenges and various 
strengths, including air quality, access to transit and active housing 
permit violations. The Indicator Project builds the level of service that 
government can and should provide to residents as they work in their 
neighborhoods, conduct their lives and make daily decisions.

Business Portal: Build Capacity 
through Efficiency

The day-to-day success of our City, as well as its recovery after a 
disaster, depends on the success of small businesses. Streamlining 
outdated and duplicative systems, the San Francisco Business Portal 
consolidates information on more than 400 permits and licenses 
available to small businesses. Some examples of forms that are 
accessible in the Business Portal include the Business Registration 
form from the Treasurer and Tax Collector required of every business, 
the Permit to Operate from the Department of Public Health for 
all restaurants, and the Dog Walking permit from Animal Care and 
Control for any dog walker with four or more dogs. Small businesses 
in San Francisco face challenges that, in the event of an unexpected 
disruption, make them vulnerable. By easing the uncertainty in the 
process of starting a new business, the City can help build a more 
resilient economy. This Portal serves as an in-operation model for the 
work that is to come. A joint project of the Department of Technology, 
Office of Economic and Workforce Development and Office of Small 
Business, in partnership with the design firm Tomorrow Partners, the 
San Francisco Business Portal advances Mayor Lee’s goal of using 
technology to make government more responsive and effective to the

forward-thinking leadership and decisive action, as well as protecting its neighborhoods. 
This office, by executing the work of this strategy, will be another voice looking 
toward San Francisco’s future. The new ORR will directly oversee the City’s 30-

Launch a Collaborative 
Community Process

The ORR’s other principal task is an extensive community process. 
Rather than bring the strategy to the community as an end product, 
our approach will be to engage in a yearlong dialogue with 
San Francisco’s neighborhoods. During the strategy’s formation, dozens 
of conversations were held with community groups and neighborhood 
leaders; we will continue to build on that dialogue, aimed at achieving a 
community action strategy as part of the broader resilience strategy. 

In many ways, this process has already begun. Our community 
engagement efforts arise from continuing partnerships with City 
departments, programs and efforts underway in the community, 
building on long-standing conversations and seeking to advance our 
City’s current and new resilience goals. 

The Office of Resilience and Recovery will work with the following

Build Partnerships to 
Advance Resilience

Many partner organizations assisted with the creation 
of this resilience strategy, including Risk Management 
Solutions (RMS), a 100 Resilient Cities Platform Partner. 
Based in the Bay Area, RMS completed an economic 
impact assessment of sea level rise. City government 
cannot do this alone. We need the ability to tap into the 
expertise of the private sector, while still acting in the 
best interests of and on behalf of the communities we 
serve. We will build on this collaboration with RMS by 
securing strategic partnerships that allow us to empower 
our communities and advance resilience. 

Neighborland is a communications 
platform that empowers city agencies to 
collaborate with neighborhood residents 
to identify real-world problems and find 
solutions. Their technology will help 
build an inclusive, accessible, integrated 
and participatory tool for communication 
and coordination between San Francisco 
government departments and residents. 
Leveraging their experience working 
with civic organizations throughout 
the U.S., including city agencies, 
universities, foundations and local 
nonprofits, Neighborland’s participatory 
planning design tools will help us 
reach as many residents as possible. 
This tool will go live and begin use in 
San Francisco neighborhoods in mid- to 
late 2016 as part of our collaborative 
community process.

  Appallicious is an open 

data visualization 
company that helps 
government better 

serve its citizens. Its data visualization 
and analysis products will allow 
neighborhoods to identify assets, 
resources and vulnerabilities so that 
government agencies, businesses and 
community-based organizations can 
collaborate on identifying opportunities, 
building capacity and addressing 
weaknesses to create more empowered 
neighborhoods. This tool will go live 
beginning in mid- to late 2016 as part of 
our collaborative community process.

 RMS is a risk-modeling 

company with the mission 
to create a more resilient 
and sustainable global 

society through a better understanding 
of catastrophic events. A partner with 
San Francisco for more than a decade, 
RMS provided modeling expertise 
regarding San Francisco’s exposure 
to sea level rise for both public and 
private assets as part of the strategy 
development process in conjunction with 
100 Resilient Cities.

Regional and Statewide Partnerships 

Achieving resilience in San Francisco 
will require state and regional action. 
The Office of Resilience and Recovery 
will work with the resilience offices in 
our neighboring cities of Oakland and 
Berkeley, our regional partners in ABAG 
and our statewide partners’ resilience 
office in Los Angeles to strengthen 
existing relationships and form new ones. 
San Francisco is not alone in forming a 
resilience strategy—three other California 
cities, Los Angeles, Oakland and Berkeley, 
have resilience programs. In addition, the 
Association of Bay Area Governments, our 
region’s planning agency, has a resilience 
program. A critical piece of this work 
will be building on those relationships 
to create a more resilient San Francisco, 
a more resilient Bay Area and a more 
resilient California.
