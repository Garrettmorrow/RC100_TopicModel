Yiannis Boutaris

Mayor of Thessaloniki

Letter from Mayor
Yiannis Boutaris

2030 is not far away - it is 13 years in the horizon. Looking back 13 years, we 
were celebrating the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece, only few years from 
the economic and political crisis. Significant changes can happen in 13 years 
and our city has survived many of those over the centuries. 

Thessaloniki used to be an important crossroad of cultures and populations, 
a melting pot of various religions and ethnicities that managed to coexist 
smoothly and positively. This embedded complexity is reflected in the present 
cultural richness of the city, the pride and unique identity of the people. 

Our administration was the first, after many years of introversion, to open up 
the city again to the world. Since 2011, we doubled the number of international 
visitors in Thessaloniki, we created a safety net for the most vulnerable, 
we provided communities with spaces for expression and action, whilst 
implementing robust internal administration and financial reform. 

Now is time to maximize our efforts further, to ensure a legacy for future 
generations and together, create a new roadmap for the ongoing development 
of the city. Our participation in the “100 Resilient Cities” network is an 
opportunity to be part of a global community of cities and people, and to 
develop a holistic strategy for the future of Thessaloniki. 

How do we want Thessaloniki to be in 2030? What are the challenges today 
and tomorrow? What should the focus of our work be over the next years? 

•  Designing and providing mobility that serves our citizens 

•  Developing an urban economy agenda that invests in the human talent 

of the city and supports local economic clusters such as tourism, creative 
economy, and historic central markets

•  Making the city welcoming to new residents, especially those coming from 

countries affected by war

•  Co-creating and activating public spaces and re-discovering the city’s 

relationship with the sea

•  Developing partnerships and enhancing collaboration among the 

municipalities of metropolitan Thessaloniki

The strategy comprises around 30 ideas that will define our actions and 
policies. Thessaloniki was, is and will remain great, it is open to change and 
progress, it is a place for people to act and interact. 

We strive to achieve our vision for a resilient Thessaloniki, and we are confident 
we will achieve it. For Thessaloniki, for the pride of its citizens, for future 
generations.

Letter from President of 100 
Resilient Cities
Michael Berkowitz

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate the 
city of Thessaloniki, Mayor Boutaris, and Chief Resilience Officer and Deputy 
Mayor in Urban Resilience and Development Planning, Lina Liakou on the 
release of “Thessaloniki 2030” the city’s Resilience Strategy, a major milestone 
for the city and 100RC’s partnership with it. An ancient city with a rich history, 
Thessaloniki builds on its past as it lays the foundations for a resilient future. 
Thessaloniki 2030 sets forth an extraordinary vision of urban resilience for all 
the residents who call this city home. 

From its perch on Thermaikos Bay, Thessaloniki has, for thousands of years, 
served as an important cultural crossroads, with an uncommonly long history 
of diversity, tolerance, and vibrant culture. As the city transforms, it uses 
this past as a guide for many of the modern challenges it now faces, such as 
shifting demographics that include an aging population and wave of refugees 
from Syria. This Strategy is a testament to Thessaloniki’s reorientation 
towards its future, and a commitment to implementing actions that ensure 
the city survives and thrives in the face of its various challenges. From the 
outset, Mayor Boutaris has shown his commitment to the realization of this 
vision by appointing the world’s first Deputy Mayor for Urban Resilience and 
Development Planning, ensuring the city has the resources and support for this 
far-reaching strategy to succeed. 

This document addresses not only potential shocks such as the sudden influx 
of thousands of refugees, earthquakes, heat waves, and floods, but also the 
city’s multiple stresses, such as air pollution caused by an overreliance on 
cars, high unemployment, and the continuing effects of the national austerity 
measures instituted in 2008. It is not a theoretical blueprint, but rather a 
concrete strategy anchored in the city’s operational procedures, and in its 
budget. It is a complete commitment to the city’s, and the region’s future. 
Through her energetic leadership in Thessaloniki, and the 100RC network, Lina 
Liakou has guided the city to this major moment. She and her team have been 
active participants and contributors in Europe and the Middle East, and learned 
important lessons from member cities as far away as San Francisco. Last year, 
the city’s resilience team was a key partner in the development of the 100RC 
Global Migration Network Exchange in Athens, in which the city shared its own 
experience with recent migration, absorbed lessons from other cities facing 
similar situations, and collaborated to develop new approaches to addressing 
urban migration by elevating the city as a key social policy facilitator. The 
Strategy reflects this kind of coordination and innovative thinking that true 
resilience requires.

Through this hard work, and collaboration with key partners, some of the 
strategy’s major initiatives are, impressively, already underway. They include 
Government Continuity Plan and Risk Information System, Thessaloniki 
Youth Resilience Challenge, Action Plan on Refugees Integration, adopting 
a public space co-creation policy, Open Schools to the neighborhoods, and 
the Investment Framework for Thermaikos Bay. Work on cross-municipal 
collaboration has also begun, aiming to build resilience at the metropolitan 
level as a vehicle for development. The support of the World Bank and the 
Ministry of the Economy, Development and Tourism also help illustrate that this 
is a living document that has already begun to strengthen the city. 

This strategy represents the beginning of the exciting work to come in the 
months and years ahead. And 100 Resilient Cities’ partnership with the city is 
also just beginning. Now we can collectively begin implementing the actions 
and initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively impact 
the lives of all who call Thessaloniki home. From its early work and active 
engagement with the network, Thessaloniki is well positioned to help us in 
leading the global urban resilience revolution. We at 100 Resilient Cities could 
not be more pleased to be a partner in these efforts.

Letter from Chief Resilience Officer
Lina Liakou

Resilience is built on hope, which gives us confidence and strength to act. This 
Resilience Strategy builds on what we have already achieved and who we are 
whilst addressing our present and future challenges. It does so by creating 
structures and processes that will ensure our progress and development. The 
Resilience Strategy of Thessaloniki is a roadmap which will help the city to co-
create a more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable city. 

Thessaloniki’s emerging reputation for international civic innovation positions 
it alongside other great cities like Rotterdam, New Orleans, and San Francisco. 
Membership of the 100 Resilient Cities network represents a major step 
towards creating a strategic, multi-disciplinary approach that is rooted in the 
city’s values and strengths while connecting with national and international 
goals and initiatives. 

The basis of our approach is the robust participation and collaboration of more 
than 40 organizations and 2,000 citizens from across the city. There is also a 
special focus on the youth of the city. Over the last year, we have formed new 
partnerships, developed new solutions and ideas, and highlighted existing and 
ongoing innovation in the city. Rigorous academic research has been aligned 
with grass-roots initiatives. City policies have been combined and supported 
by best practices from other cities to develop new objectives, programs and 
actions.

In a city that is constantly changing, this strategy represents the start 
of a process of co-creation. A way to collectively work together, sharing 
responsibility, resources, opportunities and results.

About this Strategy

Thessaloniki is a city in transformation. We are a 
port city with a long history, and a population that 
deeply values our history and culture. The city has 
experienced significant shocks and stresses during 
the recent past, but despite population shifts, a 
devastating fire and a major earthquake, we have 
responded with resilience. Today, Thessaloniki 
is a lively, multicultural city that attracts young 
people, tourists, and international business. We 
are also still focused on recovering from the 
global economic depression as well as ongoing 
environmental changes. 

Thessaloniki was selected in 2014 as part of the 
second cohort of cities to join the 100 Resilient 
Cities (100RC) network. We consider this a 
unique opportunity to implement a robust, 
participatory approach and create a long-term 
strategy to address current and future challenges, 
and in doing so to connect with other cities and 
organizations across the world via the 100RC 
network.

The 100RC methodology provided an innovative 
model for the local authority to develop a holistic 
city strategy in collaboration with adjacent 
municipalities, local academic institutions, the 
nonprofit sector, private stakeholders, citizens, 
and communities of the city. 

More than 40 organizations and 2000 citizens 
participated in our resilience dialogue, ensuring 
the strategy aligns with and complements other 
strategic initiatives in the local, regional, national 
and international domain, including the city’s 
5 year Operational Plan 2020 and European 
Strategy for 2020. 

We envision a city that guarantees the well-being 
of its people, and nurtures its human talent, while 
strengthening its urban economy and respecting 
its natural resources.

We will work towards this vision by strengthening 
Thessaloniki’s urban resilience in relation to 
population shifts, urban economy, open spaces 
and local governance.

The Resilience Strategy is based on eight city 
values (Social Cohesion, Local Identity & Heritage, 
Environmental Management, Health & Well-
being, Youth Empowerment, Multi-stakeholder 
Engagement, Technology Adaptation, Economic 
Prosperity), which represent our city’s identity and 
guide how we will plan for the future. The values 
cut across four main goals that together form the 
basis of the strategy:

•  Shape a thriving and sustainable city: Design 

and deliver urban and mobility systems that 
serve people with efficiency, environmental 
integrity, and strategic use of resources. 
This includes an integrated mobility system, 
smart urban logistics plan, clean power, air 
quality management, and upgraded waste 
management system.

•  Co-create an inclusive city: Invest in 

human talent, including skills, leadership, 
and entrepreneurship; align education and 
training to career paths; expand the role of 
boroughs as social labs; empower citizens 
and community-led projects; make the city 
welcoming to new residents; and enable co-
creation in open and public spaces.

The Resilience Strategy reflects our ambitions as a 
city. We want to be inclusive; locally oriented but 
with international partnerships and exchanges; 
and forward looking to address interrelated 
challenges, goals, targets and actions. 

•  Build a dynamic urban economy and 

responsive city: Develop an urban economy 
policy agenda which recognizes and supports 
existing and prospective local economic 
cluster activities and zones. Initiate new cross-

sector partnerships and update governance 
approaches to allow the city to respond more 
effectively to the needs of its citizens and a 
changing world through financial resilience, 
metropolitan collaboration, capital investment, 
and risk reduction management plans. 

•  Re-discover the city’s relationship with 

the sea: Integrate the economic and urban 
development of Thermaikos Bay by investing 
in the cultural and natural capital of the Bay 
for improved city life, restoring the ecosystem, 
monitoring environmental resilience, and 
designing a new governance system for 
managing these activities.

These goals are broken down into 30 objectives 
and more than 100 actions, each with multiple 
benefits for the resilience of our city and 
population. Actions include policies, projects, and 
initiatives (existing and new) that connect goals 
and city values, from youth participation to clean 
power for mobility; from waste management to 
co-ownership of public space and risk reduction.

The City of Thessaloniki joined forces with the 
Metropolitan Development Agency of Thessaloniki 
to create a strategy that delivers both local and 
metropolitan scale solutions.

To guide and promote the implementation of 
the Resilience Strategy, the city and its partners 
will monitor progress through local and global 
indicators and data sets. The Resilience Strategy 
also includes a set of Actions to improve the way 
data are aggregated, managed and shared. This 
will further facilitate the monitoring of the strategy 
by all relevant stakeholders. 

Becoming a truly resilient city requires significant 
investment in terms of both time and resources. 
It requires hard work from everyone who lives 
and works in the city. This document reflects 
the values of the city and provides a roadmap to 
guide the evolution of activities that will help us 
to work together to build resilience for decades to 
come.

About 100 
Resilient Cities

100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation (100RC) is dedicated to helping cities 
around the world become more resilient to the 
physical, social and economic challenges that 
are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC 
supports the adoption and incorporation of a 
view of resilience that includes not just the shocks 
– earthquakes, fires, floods, etc. – but also the 
stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day 
to day or cyclical basis. 

“

By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, 
a city becomes more able to respond to adverse 
events, and is overall better able to deliver basic 
functions in both good times and bad, to all 
populations.

City Resilience describes the 
capacity of cities to function, so 
that people living and working in 
cities - particularly the poor and 
vulnerable – survive and thrive no 
matter what stresses or shocks 
they encounter 

”

About The 
City Resilience 
Framework

The City Resilience Framework (CRF) provides a 
lens through which the complexity of cities and 
the numerous factors that contribute to a city’s 
resilience can be understood. It comprises 4 
dimensions and 12 key drivers.

A City in 
Transformation

Thessaloniki: 
A City in 
Transformation

Thessaloniki is a midsize city situated in northern 
Greece, on Thermaikos Bay, part of the Aegean 
Sea. It is Greece’s second largest city, home to 
the country’s second largest export and transit 
port, and the nearest European Union port to the 
Balkans and Black Sea zone. 

Thessaloniki is also considered to have direct 
influence over the whole region of Central 
Macedonia, an area of 1.9 million inhabitants (2011 
census).

Historically, Thessaloniki has strong cultural and 
economic ties with its neighboring countries in 
Southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean. 
Inhabited continuously since 315 BC, it has 
been part of the Hellenic, Roman, Byzantine 
and Ottoman empires. It also has a strong 
Jewish history, which gives the modern city a 
multicultural character. The city center features 
a diverse mix of architectural styles including 
Byzantine, neoclassical, Art Nouveau and Art 
Deco. 

Today, Thessaloniki is a lively, multicultural 
city that attracts young people, tourists, and 
international companies. Culture and history 
are highly valued by our citizens, and creative, 
cultural, and tourist projects and initiatives 
proliferate.

100 Resilient Cities | Thessaloniki Resilience Strategy

People

Thessaloniki has the largest youth population 
of any city in Greece, thanks to its wealth of 
learning and academic institutions and vibrant 
nightlife. The city hosts approximately 150,000 
students each year through four public academic 
institutions, several private colleges, and 
numerous vocational training colleges. Youth 
empowerment is already a key topic on the city’s 
agenda, evidenced by the awarding of the title 
European Youth Capital in 2014. 

Despite its large youth population, the city’s 
greatest demographic challenge is ageing. Over 
the last decade (2005-2014), the number of 
residents aged over 65 years has increased from 
15.2% to 18.4%.

Thessaloniki experienced significant population 
shifts over the last century. In 1922, the city 
doubled in size due to the arrival of 130,000 
refugees fleeing conflict in Asia Minor. This had 
knock-on effects for residential development. 

During the Second World War, the city lost 
nearly its entire Jewish population, around 20% 
of the total population in 1940, as 50,000 Greek 
Jews were sent to concentration camps. The city 
now plays host to a new wave of refugees from 
Syria and the Middle East. An estimated 15% of 
Greece’s total refugee and immigrant population 
resides in metropolitan Thessaloniki, and while 
many are in transit to other destinations in 
Europe, a significant number are expected to 
remain in the city.

Compounding these challenges, Greece’s 
recent economic and social difficulties have 
led to an increase in the population at risk of 
poverty across all ages and social groups. On 
the positive side, these circumstances have also 
inspired an increase in citizen-led initiatives, 
solidarity networks, new skills and resource 
sharing systems, and demand for more active 
participation in the everyday life and decision-
making processes of the city.

Economy

Austerity measures put in place since 2009 to 
tackle Greece’s economic recession have resulted 
in a 29% drop in per capita domestic product 
(from € 19,500 in 2008 to € 13,900 in 2013, 
Eurostat) and an increase in the unemployment 
rate to over 30%, of which more than half are 
young people. Since 2008, 400,000 people have 
left the country to study and/or work abroad, 
and many businesses have closed or moved 
to other countries, particularly to neighboring 
Bulgaria, mainly due to high domestic taxation 
and a lack of investment incentives. 

In this context, tourism became the areas’s fastest 
growing economic activity. Thessaloniki has 
increased the number of international tourists by 
30%, overnight stays by 110%, and international 
flights by 15% since 2009. International events 
also help to draw in foreign visitors to the city. 
Events like the Thessaloniki International Film 
Festival, Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, 
Thessaloniki Food Festival and Thessaloniki 
Pride Festival are held annually, and the city 
increasingly hosts international events like the 
World Music Expo (WOMEX, 2012) and the 12th 
World MaxiBasketball Championship (2013).

The city is now looking to activate and support 
local talent, employing the lessons learned from 
the development of the tourism sector to grow 
other local industries, regenerate the urban 
economy, and attract investments that promote 
sustainable growth. Entrepreneurs, businesses, 
local authorities, professional networks, young 
people and many others are all looking to 
use the city’s assets to create new economic 
opportunities and value. We have many existing 
strengths to build on, including our geographical 
position, Mediterranean climate, culture and 
heritage resources, and the friendliness of our 
citizens.

To date there has been limited analysis of the 
linkages between employment, productivity, 
and urban finance in the metropolitan area. We 
need to understand the economic structure of 
the city, including productivity and its impact 
on employment and quality of life, in order to 
develop effective and long-term strategies to 
support priority sectors and economic clusters. 
This will help the city diversify its economy, and 
prepare it for any future global economic shocks.

Urban Environment and Natural 
Resources

The city has a dense urban structure with limited 
open or green spaces. There is currently 2.6m2 
of green space per resident, compared to the 
European average of 8-10m2. The absence or 
fragmentation of green and open space creates 
a shortage of suitable leisure environments and 
intensifies the impact of natural phenomena such 
as high temperatures during the summer and 
intense rainfalls during the winter. This is further 
exacerbated by the high density of old, poorly 
maintained and energy inefficient buildings, 
particularly in poorer neighborhoods.

Mobility is a major stress affecting the everyday 
lives of Thessaloniki’s residents, particularly as it 
contributes to air pollution, which is one of the 
city’s key current priorities. There are limited 
public transportation options available at present, 
causing people to rely heavily on cars. The city’s 
mobility infrastructure is not prepared for major 
incidents or adequate for future needs. There is 
currently no integrated plan for mobility systems, 
and only disjointed plans for new transport 
options. Inefficient mobility services, high 
population density, and lack of public information 
and awareness about hazards and emergency 
escape routes compound the potential threat this 
stress poses to the city and its people.

Thessaloniki is also exposed to some major 
natural hazards and shocks such as earthquakes, 
urban floods and forest fires, as well as seasonal 
and weather-related events that interrupt city 
services and business continuity, like snow, sub-
zero temperatures, floods and heat waves.

Thessaloniki’s most important natural resource 
is Thermaikos Bay. Thermaikos is a landmark 
offering unique opportunities for sustainable 
urban development. The recent redevelopment of 
the New Waterfront gave Thermaikos a renewed 
and important role in the everyday life of its 
citizens. It is now the most popular public space 
in the city and the number one tourist attraction. 
Nevertheless, the full potential of the waterfront 
and the Bay remains underutilized in economic, 
environmental and leisure terms.

Natural Hazards

Surface flooding: 
Extensive flooding in 2009 and 2014 
demonstrated that, despite Thessaloniki’s 
favorable topography, flood mitigation 
infrastructure needs to improve. Seven streams in 
the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki have been 
classified as prone to flooding. 
Due to poor historic urban development 
regulation, the combined sewer system currently 
cannot handle peak flows during flood events. 
The dense urban environment also prevents 
significant retention and storage of stormwater. 
This has contributed to infrastructure failures and 
localized flooding.
Fire at peri-urban forest: 
In 1997 the peri-urban forest of Chortiatis was 
partially destroyed by a wildfire. Since then, the 
city has sprawled towards the forest area. 
Part of the city bypass road is now on the limits 
of the forest, and some of the city’s infrastructure 
is located within the forest area. Consequently, 
the threat from wildfire to the city has increased. 
Climate change is also creating additional 
challenges for the protection of the peri-urban 
forest.
Earthquakes: 
This is a major threat to the city and surrounding 
areas. In 1978, an earthquake measuring 6.5 on 
the Richter scale struck the city leading to 49 
deaths, severe damage to infrastructure and 
property, and an economic cost of USD 250 
million. Projections indicate that an earthquake 
of the same magnitude today would cause 4% of 
the city’s building stock to be damaged beyond 
repair.

100 Resilient Cities | Thessaloniki Resilience Strategy21

The Municipality of Thessaloniki manages a 
budget of 380million euros for 2017. 50% of the 
city’s budget comes from central government 
funding, and the remaining 50% comes from 
taxes, rental revenues and other local sources. 
The city’s ability to attract and manage urban 
investments is limited because of the current 
legislative framework and the human capacity of 
the City administration. 

Currently the city is heavily dependent on 
European funding for new urban projects. To 
enhance its resilience, the city must diversify its 
funding sources and leverage new partnerships 
to access private investments that produce a 
return on investment.

Governance and Urban Finance

Local authority governance in Greece consists 
of two main levels: municipalities and regions. 
The City of Thessaloniki and the municipalities 
that make up the metropolitan area are part 
of the Region of Central Macedonia. There is 
no Metropolitan Governance System operating 
between the municipality and the regional level.

This approach to governance results in the 
following challenges: 

1) Lack of economic independence of 
municipalities

2) Complicated, disjointed and conflicting 
jurisdictional boundaries across municipalities, 
regional authorities and central government on 
issues like mobility, flood prevention, and risk 
management

3) The management of European funds stops at 
the regional level. 

To tackle these challenges, Thessaloniki and its 
neighboring municipalities need to implement an 
effective, coordinated plan that incorporates all 
institutions that are relevant at the metropolitan 
level.

Thessaloniki's 
resilience journey

Thessaloniki was selected in 2014 as part of the 
second cohort of cities to join the 100 Resilient 
Cities (100RC) network. The City of Thessaloniki 
considers this a unique opportunity to implement 
a robust, participatory approach to create a long-
term strategy tha addresses current and future 
challenges.

The 100RC methodology provided an innovative 
model to help the local authority develop a 
holistic city strategy in collaboration with adjacent 
municipalities, local academic institutions, the 
nonprofit sector, private stakeholders, citizens, 
and communities of the city. The strategy also 
connects Thessaloniki with other cities and 
organizations across the world via the 100RC 
network.

More than 40 organizations and 2,000 citizens 
have participated in the resilience dialogue 
between March 2016 and March 2017, via 
committees, working groups, workshops, round 
tables, and public events.

Thessaloniki’s Resilience Strategy also 
complements other strategic documents in 
the local, regional, national and international 
domain, including the city’s 5 year Operational 
Plan 2020 and European Strategy for 2020. 
This helps to bridge the gap between the 
everyday management of the city and long-term 
development goals and commitments.

Organizational structure

100RC strategy development 
process

Thessaloniki has a dense urban structure 
consisting of 10 municipalities. Despite the 
lack of an integrated metropolitan governance 
structure, the City of Thessaloniki joined forces 
with the Metropolitan Development Agency of 
Thessaloniki to create a strategy that addresses 
both local and metropolitan issues and solutions.

To prepare the strategy, the Department of 
Urban Resilience followed a two-phase process. 
In Phase I, an initial resilience assessment was 
conducted and discovery areas were identified. In 
Phase II, these were explored further, alongside 
diagnostic and analytical activities that led to the 
final development of the resilience strategy.

The organizational structure of the strategy 
development is presented in the following

How citizens shaped the strategy

Collaboration and citizen engagement in the 
development of the strategy were key priorities 
for the city’s administration and the Mayor. The 
city aims to foster active citizen participation, 
empower self-organizing groups, and support 
new forms of collective action to address issues 
of public concern. Continuous participation 
from diverse stakeholders is essential to the 
development of every phase of the city’s 
Resilience Strategy. 

The strategy development process consisted of 
the following stakeholder activities:

1.  Building trust amongst stakeholders by 

assessing perceptions of resilience across 

the city. This process was conducted via 
one-to-one interviews, group meetings 
and workshops, online and in-person 
questionnaires, and open public events.

2.  Initiating dialogue, broad engagement 

and participation through various thematic 
working group meetings, workshops and 
mini-labs focusing on developing new ideas.

3.  Activating the network and beginning 

resilience-in-action through mini-labs 
focusing on the implementation of solutions.

Over a period of 12 months, more than 2,000 
people and 40 organizations contributed to 
Thessaloniki’s Resilience Strategy.

People's perceptions of 
Thessaloniki

Analysis carried out in Phase I revealed that the 
majority of people in Thessaloniki believe the 
city to be youthful, somewhat conservative, and 
lacking in environmental consciousness, but also 
outward facing and hospitable. 

People consider the city’s greatest strengths to 
be its geographic location, its local history, and 
its culture. Overall, 38% of citizens believe that 
the municipality should focus on developing the 
local economy, 25% on improving mobility, and 
15% on improving public spaces.

Thessaloniki 
Values

Becoming a truly resilient city requires significant 
investment in terms of both time and resources. 
It requires hard work from all stakeholders across 
the city. This document reflects the values of 
the city. It is an evolving approach that will help 
us to focus our activities and build resilience for 
decades to come.

By strengthening Thessaloniki’s resilience towards 
its population shifts, urban economy, open spaces 
and local governance:

We envision an inspiring city that ensures the 
well-being of its people, and nurtures its human 
talent, while strengthening its urban economy 
and respecting its natural resources. 

We will work towards this vision by strengthening 
Thessaloniki’s urban resilience towards its 
population shifts, urban economy, open spaces 
and local governance.

The following sections outline our strategic 
approaches and in this context, we define:

City values represent our city’s identity and guide 
how we plan for the future.

Goals are longer term statements which address 
the vision statement and illustrate overall impact.

Objectives Objectives are mid- and long-term 
outcomes that the city agrees are the most 
important to fulfilling the vision and goals. 
Objectives have multiple resilience benefits and 
connect different goals and city values.

Actions are the specific project level, including 
tactical activities to help accomplish the 
objectives. Actions can be policies, projects, 
and initiatives. They can be very simple or 
complex tasks, at the local or metropolitan scale. 
Actions require collaboration between different 
stakeholders and level of governance in their 
implementation, ownership, data monitoring and 
impact evaluation.

Objective A: 
Build an integrated resilient 
mobility system

The mobility system in Thessaloniki is facing a number of significant 
challenges including limited public transport options, over reliance 
on private car use, and ageing infrastructure. 

The city has experienced a number of emergency situations in 
recent years, many due to the insufficient and reduced capacity of 
the public transport system, and in particular, the bus system. 

This has led to severe traffic congestion and obstruction of the city 
road network. The completion of the main metro line by 2020 will 
be a major step to improve public transportation, but the city needs 
to do more. 

Despite an abundance of transport plans and studies for new modes 
and hubs, Thessaloniki lacks an integrated plan for its mobility 
system. We will develop a plan that integrates buses and new modes 
of transport, helping to shift usage away from the private car. Issues 
of institutionalization (creating a new Public Transport Authority), 
project planning and prioritization for urban mobility investments, 
and setting specific targets and policies must be addressed to 
maximize the capacity and redundancy of the mobility system. 

This will ensure everyone in the city has access to public transport. It 
will improve passenger safety by reducing the numbers of accidents 
and congestion events and it will help to reduce air and noise 
pollution. The plan will improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness 
of transporting people and goods around the city. It will contribute 
to enhancing the design, attractiveness and quality of the urban 
environment. And it will help us to plan for and develop non-
motorized vehicle and intermodal transport networks.

Approach/Framework

Stakeholder collaboration

To facilitate institutional coordination on mobility 
projects, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has 
been signed between MDATh, ThePTA, EGNATIA SA, 
and HIT/CERTH under the title “Thessaloniki Resilient 
Mobility System: Integrated System for Urban Mobility 
and Traffic for the greater area of Thessaloniki”. 

The scope of the MoU is to build consensus between 
stakeholders by involving organizations from the public 
sector, technological institutes, and local authorities. 

The MoU will help all parties to reach an agreement on 
prioritizing mobility projects and construction of new 
transportation modes, establishing a business plan for 
mobility, and sourcing technical assistance and funding 
from national or global sources. 

We will implement a holistic plan for a Resilient Mobility 
System that serves our sustainable development 
goals and enhances the well-being of everyone in 
Thessaloniki.

Action 01: 
Institutional reform of the 
Public Transport Authority

The bus system is supervised by the Thessaloniki 
Public Transport Authority (PTA), a decentralized 
public agency under the Ministry of Infrastructure 
established in 2001. 

ThePTA is responsible for the supervision of the bus 
system (OASTh) but has little authority over the 
overall mobility planning and monitoring of the city. 
The urgent need to improve the Public Transport 
System led to the construction of new transportation 
modes including the Metro (under construction), and 
Urban Sea Transportation system (under assessment). 

We will establish a reformed Public Transport 
Authority with key functions such as: (1) designing, 
tendering and awarding service contracts, (2) planning 
and monitoring service performance, (3) allocating 
resources between public transport operators, (4) 
appraising and prioritizing potential investments to 
promote a multimodal and integrated public transport 
system, and (5) managing contingency plans and 
emergency procedures between operators. Inter-
municipal and multi-level governance of ThePTA 
participation with local authorities will be crucial to its 
success.

Action 02: 
Re-structure the Metropolitan 
SUMP and align local SUMPs

In-depth 

The development of a Sustainable Urban Mobility 
Plans (SUMP) is not mandatory for local authorities 
in Thessaloniki and currently there are no national 
or regional guidelines on developing a SUMP. 
However, since 2011, the European Union has strongly 
recommended that cities with a population over 
100,000 develop a SUMP to facilitate the funding 
of mobility projects. Local authorities within the 
metropolitan area of Thessaloniki have started 
developing their local SUMPs which are applicable 
within their administrative borders. 

A metropolitan scale SUMP was created by ThePTA 
in 2014 under the EU project framework ATTAC. 
However it lacked clear objectives, methods, resources 
and criteria linked to policies, initiatives or projects to 
meet the overall vision for the City. We will facilitate 
the development of a comprehensive SUMP to align 
and embed the local SUMPs under one strategic 
vision. Improving ThePTA will lead to the restructuring 
of the metropolitan SUMP and will align the local 
SUMPs.

The risks of sudden snowfall

At 10am on 10 January 2017, snow began to fall after 
4 days of subzero temperatures. The snow became 
heavier and by noon had accumulated on city streets, 
impeding traffic even in the urban center. 

Public bus services started to fail due to the freezing 
temperatures, and people tried to leave the city center 
for residential areas in their cars. 

According to the traffic police, there were an estimated 
400,000 vehicles that afternoon operating in a road 
network built for 70,000. 

Inevitably, huge traffic jams followed. Key road arteries 
were blocked for more than five hours and emergency 
services were unable to move freely, causing major risks 
across the city. 

This snowfall should not have caused such a notable 
disruption in the life of the city and citizens, but 
the infrastructure and coordination among relevant 
authorities and stakeholders was inadequate. 

The event demonstrated the fragility of our mobility 
network and its potential to impact the wider city in the 
event of a sudden shock. Strengthening this system is 
essential to protecting and enhancing the resilience of 
the whole city. 

Basic mobility perceptions, from the 
Resilience Questionnaire

1 in 2 people believe more frequent bus services are 
needed to improve the city’s mobility. 
7 out of 10 deem current mobility in the city 
center inadequate. 

6 in 10 spend 15-60 minutes commuting on a daily 
basis.

1 in 4 believe that improving mobility should be the 
city’s top priority, despite the fact that financial crisis is 
the major concern of citizens

Action 03: 
Plan new mobility projects

In-depth 

Despite the lack of an integrated transport authority 
and a robust metropolitan SUMP, a number of public 
transport studies are either under assessment 
or construction across the city. We will facilitate 
coordination between the stakeholders to reform 
the complicated legal framework and operation 
of the Metro in 2020 to ensure that the proposals 
are complimentary and economically feasible. The 
following activities will be undertaken: 1) consensus of 
different stakeholders through a MoU (MoU already 
signed) and 2) secure technical assistance with the 
aim to;

• 

specify common objectives 

•  update the Origin-Destination matrix 

• 

apply the resilience design thinking 

•  perform a holistic Socio-Economic Analysis

•  perform Financial and Fiscal Analysis for the 

constructions of each project

• 

rank projects based on their necessity and 
feasibility and prioritize actions

Objective B: 
Adopt Transit Oriented 
Development (TOD)

€

Long delays in the completion of the Metro had devastating impacts 
on the social and economic fabric of the neighborhoods adjacent to 
the metro station construction sites, particularly in the city center. 

This left multiple empty storefronts, precipitated business closures, 
and increased tension and mistrust between business owners, 
residents and authorities. Metro excavations also revealed significant 
Byzantine artefacts that need to be protected and preserved. 

The completion of the Metro stations in 2020 will contribute to 
Transit Oriented Development (TOD) plans that see station areas 
as multimodal hubs, accessible to the residents of the adjacent 
neighborhoods through quality public spaces. This will also deliver 
new economic development opportunities for people in those 
areas. And it will help to link them to existing mainstream cultural, 
economic and touristic corridors of Thessaloniki.

TOD will promote economic development and easy access for 
residents and neighborhoods. It will also provide new public open 
spaces and enhance tourism opportunities.

Action 01: 
Map the areas within 400m 
radius from the planned Metro 
Stations (under construction) 

We will map the land-uses, available building stock, 
historical and cultural landmarks, schools and other 
municipal properties, and mobility flows within a 
400m radius of the metro stations. 

This will provide the City with the necessary data 
to develop policies and plans for the sustainable 
regeneration of the metro areas.

Action 02: 
Assess the introduction of 
further non-car dominant 
transit modes

Action 03: 
Prepare sustainable, area-
wide plans according to TOD 
Standards 

The new metro will change how people get around 
in the city. Metro stations, especially in high density 
areas, will become multimodal hubs connecting 
different transportation networks (e.g. Metro and bus 
networks. 

We will design the urban spaces around the 
metro stations with new pedestrian zones, street 
furniture, public art installations, services and 
structures according to the principles of multimodal 
transportation. 

We will undertake an assessment of non-car transit 
through the re-organization of the bus system, 
provision of cycling infrastructure (cycle parking, 
lanes, and sharing systems), and car parking areas 
(especially at the stations on the outskirts of the city). 

This will help to meet the objective of reducing private 
car use in the City center whilst promoting alternative 
means of mobility.

Metro S.A., ThePTA, HIT/CERTH

Timescale: Medium Term

Status: Ongoing

This will contribute to a new identity in these areas 
and create economic development opportunities for 
existing residents and businesses. 

In particular, we will focus on the redevelopment of an 
archaeological plaza in the area of Venizelou Station 
to connect the metro station and the new Byzantine 
findings with cultural assets on Egnatia Street. 

The surrounding area will become a new city 
destination for both visitors and residents.

Objective C: 
Develop smart urban logistics

Private buses, lorries and trucks are the main modes of tourist and commercial 
transport in the surrounding neighborhoods of the city center. 

Despite the city’s effort to regulate day-to-day freight transport using time restrictions 
and regulations on the size of the lorries, a more integrated approach is needed. 

This will benefit businesses, the residents and the urban environment by minimizing 
costs for businesses, reducing the environmental impacts (air and noise pollution) 
through clean power freight movement (cycling and electromobility) and reducing 
traffic congestion.

Action 01: 
Data analysis of the existing 
urban freight distribution 
system

The local economy heavily relies on the small retail 
and grocery shops. 

While there is no data on urban freight distribution, we 
are sure there are multiple hidden costs and significant 
environmental impacts in the existing supply chain. 

We will collect this data, mainly in the historical 
center, and establish specific metrics for evaluation of 
proposed reforms.

Partners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, HIT/
CERTH

Before proposing new systems of freight distribution, 
we need to understand the existing urban distribution 
situation and formulate a clear picture about routes, 
loads, needs and services, through data collection.

Action 02: 
Feasibility study about Urban 
Logistcs Centers

We will reorganize the urban freight distribution 
system to include a set of regulatory, organizational, 
operational and technological measures. 

For example the City might choose to take initial 
control (during the start-up phase) and gradually pass 
ownership to private stakeholders.

The core of this is Urban Consolidation Centers. The 
number of centers, locations, ownership (co-op, 
public, and private), size and management of these 
system will be addressed through a feasibility study. 
This will examine both the current conditions and 
examples of other systems in cities of a similar size to 
Thessaloniki.

Action 03: 
Measures for clean city 
distribution

New city logistics schemes have to be integrated in 
the broader context of city mobility and transport 
measures to reduce the impact of freight traffic in the 
city center. 

Measures under this action will include optimizing 
load and delivery routes, developing added-value 
innovative services, and rolling out eco-friendly 
delivery vehicles. 

Strong local consensus among stakeholders will be 
essential to its success. We will explore the following 
Potential measures for a “clean” city distribution 
system:

•  Regulatory initiatives for the promotion of electric 

battery vans, ideal for multi-drop stop/start 
deliveries and bike distribution systems

•  Loading/Unloading Areas supported by electronic 

reservation services 

• 

Implementation of innovative citizen and tourist 
oriented delivery schemes

•  Home delivery services, for specific user 

categories (e.g. elderly people, etc.)

Objective D: 
Move to clean power for 
transport

Shifting to cleaner energy practices is important to the City of 
Thessaloniki. First we will focus on the transport sector, through 
the promotion of cycling and the electrification of our car fleet. We 
want to create a new culture for cycling for everyone in the city. At 
present, we only have one dedicated 2.5 km cycle lane (completed 
in 2014 on the waterfront). 

The other 10km of cycle lanes are restricted to the administrative 
boundaries of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. We will design a new 
metropolitan cycle lane network connecting the various municipal 
bike lanes, and including common specifications. Together with 
a series of soft actions, this will promote cycling as the preferred 
mode of commuting in the city.

We will also electrify the municipal car fleet, and implement 
infrastructure to promote and facilitate the use of privately owned 
electric cars (e.g. special lanes, parking spaces). The city will 
collaborate with the bus operator to replace all public buses with 
electric buses by 2020. 

These measures will contribute to climate change mitigation, reduce 
the city’s energy footprint, decrease the use of private cars and 
traffic congestion, reduce air and noise pollution, and provide a 
healthy, low-cost alternative mode of transport, accessible to all.

Action 01: 
Design of a Metropolitan bike 
lane network

The City of Thessaloniki is part of a broader urban 
agglomeration that consists of 10 municipalities, each 
with its own sustainable mobility policy and strategy. 

As a result, many cycle lanes do not connect at a 
metropolitan scale, hindering the use of bikes for 
commuting. We will study citizens’ commuting 
patterns and flows, including metro, walking and 
cycling to inform the design of a new metropolitan 
cycle lane network that will facilitate and promote 
cycling as an everyday activity. 

We will also plan and design two additional cycle 
lanes; a bike trail for leisure and sports use along the 
Regional Channel, the City’s most important flood 
prevention route located at the north-east part of the 
City; and a bike lane along the waterfront to connect 
the two ends of Thermaikos Bay, from Kalohori to 
Aggelohori. This will create a cultural, environmental 
and tourist-friendly promenade.

100 Resilient Cities | Thessaloniki Resilience StrategyAction 02: 
Expand the network of bike 
sharing

The current bike sharing system includes 70 bikes 
across nine stations mainly along the waterfront. 

Given the size of the City, the proportion of available 
rental bicycles per citizen is low. 

We will therefore expand the system and deploy 
more bike sharing stations along existing, planned 
and future cycle routes, especially around metro 
stations and touristic areas to promote multimodal 
transportation and facilitate everyday cycle use. 

The current bike sharing system in Thessaloniki will 
remain privately funded during the expansion. To 
inform more efficient decision-making, the City will 
also collect data on citizens’ mobility patterns, air 
quality measurements, and more.

Featured project

European Collaboration

The URBACT program aims to foster sustainable 
integrated urban development in cities across Europe. 
The program uses networking and shared learning to 
strengthen cities’ capacity to deliver integrated urban 
policies, strategies and actions. 

Thessaloniki is part of the URBACT Resilient 
Europe network that applies innovative governance 
methodologies to assess what city resilience means for 
each city and help them formulate Integrated Action 
Plans. 

Thessaloniki is focusing on promoting cycling, 
developing cycling culture amongst younger 
citizens, and providing new cycling infrastructure. 
The neighborhood of Toumpa (in the 4th Borough) 
was selected as an Urban Living Lab in which a 
local Action Plan will be developed. The Action Plan 
includes installing bike lanes and stands across the 
city, upgrading city lighting, and rolling out awareness 
campaigns in local schools. 

Changing attitudes towards cycling is an important 
element of the program. We have great weather for 
cycling but we need to get people thinking about it as 
a mode of transport and not just a recreational activity. 

We are also looking into best practice around the 
design of the cycle network to make sure it connects 
the city center with the adjacent municipalities of the 
metropolitan area. We are also considering bike sharing 
schemes and innovative funding mechanisms to deliver 
the program. 

The program is due to complete in 2018. To help deliver 
it, we joined the URBACT Local Support Group which 
brings together stakeholders from the local council, 
public transport authority, private firms, civil society 
groups, and the cycling community.

Action 03: 
Soft actions to promote 
cycling

Action 04: 
Create infrastucture for private 
electromobility 

Alongside the redesign of the cycle lanes and 
the expansion of the bike sharing system, we will 
implement the following complementary soft actions 
to increase cycling as a mode of transport: 

•  Create city maps for bike users, featuring routes, 

distances, landmarks, bike stands, and bike 
friendly businesses, areas of interests, water 
facilities, and shaded routes. 

The city has limited authority to regulate the use of 
private electric cars. 

However, we will facilitate access to electric charging 
points by offering incentives in selected locations 
within the city limits, such as allocation of special 
parking spaces, reduction of parking fees, introduction 
of Low Emissions Zones, and electric car sharing 
stations. 

•  Develop campaigns for the design of personalized 

routes to highlight the benefits of cycling, 
specifically targeting areas where university 
students live 

•  Establish bike-related festivals and events (e.g. 

sustainable mobility week, car-free day, bike-day)

Action 05: 
Convert the city car fleet to 
electric

Action 06: 
Make all public buses electric

Thessaloniki is part of the “Covenant of Mayors for 
Climate & Energy”. 

Member cities are committed to reduce CO2 emissions 
by at least 40% by 2030 and adopt an integrated 
approach to tackling climate change mitigation and 
adaptation. 

According to the city's existing Sustainable Energy 
Plan, 30% of our CO2 emissions reductions will come 
from the transport sector. 

To achieve this, we will gradually replace the old 
municipal vehicles with new electric vehicles and make 
the City a leader in clean-powered transport.  

Partners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki

The current public bus fleet is one of the worst air 
polluters in the City. It is paramount that the bus 
operators replace public buses with electric powered 
buses. 

As the city has limited authority in this area (based on 
1370/2007 EU Regulation), central government will 
need to re-negotiate existing terms with bus operators 
and impose new regulations and specifications to 
promote clean transport. 

The City has actively declared our need for more 
environmentally responsible bus operations. 

We will work with the government with and participate 
in any new scheme to improve public transport and 
the environment.

Objective E: 
Reduce air pollution and 
urban noise

Air pollution is one of Thessaloniki's most pressing environmental 
challenges. The city does not have accurate information on current 
air quality levels due to inconsistencies in data collection across 
municipal and regional authorities. 

There is also currently no Air Quality Management System in 
operation in greater Thessaloniki. We will create a common platform 
to centralize and coordinate air quality stations in the metropolitan 
area. 

This will create a robust and reflective tool for air quality assessment 
and monitoring. We will also establish a metropolitan air quality 
fund to support air quality projects recognized as best practice 
worldwide e.g. metropolitan bike lanes, free public transports on 
heavily polluted days etc. This tool and the governance structure 
that supports it may also be used to address urban noise pollution.

Monitoring and evaluating the city's air quality will help to improve 
air quality, mitigate air pollution, protect the health of citizens, 
especially children, and safeguard historical assets which are prone 
to deteriorate in the presence of air pollutants.

Thessaloniki's Goals, Objectives and Actions

49

Action 01: 
Operate an Air Quality 
Management System (AQMS) 
of Thessaloniki 

Action 02: 
Upgrade the air quality 
monitoring system and 
introduce new stations  

Air pollution is both a shock and a stress. A stress 
when associated with ongoing private car use, and a 
shock in relation to incidents such as peri-urban forest 
fires, odors in the western suburbs, and wild fires at 
landfill sites. 

The EU Air Quality Directive (2008/50) encourages 
cities to introduce air quality assessment and 
management protocols to facilitate monitoring and 
inform decision making. The regional authority of 
Thessaloniki has such a system - intended to provide 
daily forecasting and an interactive interface for 
emissions scenario - however it is not currently 
operational. 

We will advocate for the re-instatement of the system 
and facilitate closer collaboration with the Public 
Transport Authority on air pollution forecasting and 
scenario building. 

The City maintains seven air quality and 
meteorological stations within the City’s limits. These 
have been measuring air pollution and collecting 
meteorological data since 1989. 

The data collected are published on a website and 
on the municipality open data portal. Data is being 
collected by various stakeholders and organizations 
in the metropolitan area, including the Regional 
Authority, Municipality of Pavlos Melas and other 
municipalities, AUTh, individuals and private 
companies. 

We will facilitate the centralization of this data and 
combine it with additional sources of information 
gathered from mobile sources. 

The data platform will be open and accessible to 
everyone through the City’s Open Dashboard.

In-depth 

Bus operator strike

On two consecutive days in July 2016, strikes by the public 
bus operator forced passengers to turn to private cars and 
taxis to get around. 

This event highlighted the link between good air quality 
and the existence of a robust, clean and redundant public 
transport system. 

This caused major traffic congestion that contributed to a 
30% increase in PM levels and resulted in EU air pollution 
thresholds being exceeded during the afternoon rush hour. 
Compounded by meteorological factors that week (weak 
wind), an increase in air pollution was directly linked to the 
absence of public transport services. 

It also caused many people to avoid the city center during 
this time, with consequences for access to services and 
the local economy. In September 2016, another strike 
lasted nearly two weeks, highlighting that this is an 
ongoing concern.

To improve air quality and reduce noise pollution, 
cities are implementing initiatives such as low traffic 
days and the closing of certain streets at particular 
times. 

We will support the implementation of actions that 
improve air quality through a Metropolitan Air Quality 
Fund that will raise funds and sponsor innovative 
actions such as: 

A number of measures aimed at reducing private 
car usage have already been undertaken in the City 
center. We will build on these to establish a Low 
Emission Zones in the City and neighborhoods with 
high exposure to pollution. 

• 

supply of low emission vehicles, 

•  metropolitan bike lanes

•  digital signage to reduce engine idling. 

We will implement a series of measures specifically 
targeted on reducing emissions and we will collaborate 
with the local boroughs, the Transport Authority and 
the community. Measures could include: 

•  Reducing overall vehicle kilometers 

• 

Incentivizing the purchase of low-emission 
vehicles 

• 

Improvements to the urban realm 

•  Re-organization of the bus lanes and traffic light

Action 05: 
Reduction of noise pollution

Featured project

30% of the population in Thessaloniki is exposed 
to noise levels above 75db during the day, 
especially around major arteries such as Nikis Blv., 
Egnatia Str. and Tsimiski St. This is higher than the 
recommended EU threshold limit. 

Thessaloniki lacks integrated data, measures and 
policy enforcement to address noise pollution, 
integrated data measurements, mitigation actions 
and enforcement of the existing policies. 

We will therefore develop an intensive campaign to 
identify hotspots of noise pollution.

Air quality in brief

We have seen great improvements in air quality over 
the last few years thanks to the implementation of 
European Directives and strict national legislation on 
fuel quality and environmental protection requirements 
for industry and the transport sector. 

The financial crisis also resulted in declining industrial 
activity and reduced transportation needs. 

Despite all this, air pollution continues to be a major 
concern for citizens and local stakeholders, and levels 
of particulate matter (PM10) and other pollutants ozone 
(O3) remain above the recommended thresholds, 
especially in the summer months.

I

Waste management is currently dealt with at a national, regional, 
and local (municipal) scale with little participation from citizens and 
local entrepreneurs. 

Our aim is to embed circular economy principles to make waste 
a resource for new products and services, to reduce the amount 
of waste the city generates, to promote recycling and upcycling, 
improve recycling rates, cultivate environmental awareness, and 
create new local economic opportunities.

Action 01: 
Implement circular economy 
principles in the city 

The Local Waste Management Action Plan commits 
the City to recycle 60% of its total waste by 2020. 
Improving waste collection, increasing recycling 
and up cycling streams are the first steps towards 
establishing a more circular economy. 

With the support of policies such as Green Public 
Procurement, we will implement circular economy 
practices in the City. 

These will influence consumption patterns, encourage 
re-use and repair, establish Green Spots and seminars 
and activities for up-cycling. 

We will also explore the development of urban 
composting systems. Strengthening our circular 

economy will help us tackle climate change, create 
employment opportunities and boost economic 
growth.

To strengthen recycling steams, we will facilitate 
the establishment of Green Spots in neighborhoods. 
These will allow citizens to separate recyclable waste 
for recycling or reuse. 

They will also become hubs for public awareness 
campaigns and educational seminars on reusing and 
up cycling of materials. 

We will also provide citizens with incentives and 
rewards in the form of a "Recycler card". 

The card will measure the quantities of waste recycled 
and give rewards such as reduced price tickets to use 
on public transport, or reduced priced entry to sports 
facilities.

Thessaloniki’s city center comprises dense commercial 
and residential areas with numerous historical and 
cultural assets. 

The collection of waste is a source of controversy 
between residents, the City and businesses. 

We therefore need to optimize waste truck journeys 
to decrease both energy consumption and traffic 
congestion. 

We will develop smart applications for better waste 
collection (smart bins) and replace above-ground bins 
with subterranean alternatives with a higher capacity.

Approach/Framework

“

Circular solutions to waste

In Greece, local authorities typically handle two waste 
streams: urban waste and package material. These are 
collected in separate locations. 

This is quite limited and we know we need to move on 
from the current linear model – the 'take, make, use 
and throw away' approach - to a new more sustainable 
waste management system in which product loops and 
materials chains are closed, and new economic models 
are developed. 

Adopting a circular economy approach at the city 
level requires a workforce with specific skills in 
redesigning products and services and upcycling used 
materials extracted from these products. Adopting this 
approach will also allow us to create new business and 
employment opportunities. 

Circular city strategies need to 
go hand in hand with bottom-up 
initiatives by citizens and private 
companies. Empowering people 
to bring their own ideas into 
practice generates enthusiasm 
for the circular economy and 
mobilises the people’s creativity.

Objective G: 
Strengthen environmental 
public awareness for a 
stronger environmental 
policy

Advanced environmental awareness is essential to implementing 
successful environmental policies (e.g. understanding of 
environmental costs, waste reduction, recycling and water usage). 
Starting environmental education at an early age builds strong 
environmental consciousness and good habits amongst tomorrow’s 
citizens. 

We will develop internet based platforms and social media and data 
visualization initiatives.

These will operate alongside environmental education in schools, 
helping to promote environmental awareness and develop new ideas 
and innovative solutions to help improve citizens' lives and protect 
the environment.

Action 01: 
Establish a centre for 
environmental education
Environmental Education Centers are the backbone 
of environmental education in Greece. The centers 
are joint efforts between the Ministry of Education 
and the local municipality, staffed by the Ministry and 
equipped and maintained by the City. 

The Ministry recently granted Thessaloniki the right to 
establish its own center for environmental education. 
This will provide education to students of all levels on 
issues ranging from climate change mitigation and 
water protection, to sustainable urban development 
and urban agriculture.

Government

Timescale: Short Term

Status: Planned

Action 02: 
Develop environmental 
campaigns
We will develop traditional and digital environmental 
campaigns targeting the youth and older generations 
to raise awareness about waste management, water 
and energy consumption, and food composting. 

The campaign aims to influence people’s behavior and 
strengthen trust between citizens and the City.

Action 03: 
Climathon - an annual event to 
crowdsource ideas

A Climathon is a hackathon type event which aims 
to help cities find innovative ways to tackle climate 
change and encourage people to take climate action 
in their city. Participants engage on social media with 
participants from other cities to discuss and share 
ideas. 

A jury selects the best team and provides support and 
coaching to develop the winning idea further. This is 
a great opportunity for Thessaloniki to engage with 
its human talent and develop innovative solutions for 
climate change adaptation. 

A successful Climathon was organized in the city 
for the first time in 2016, on the theme of 'Inspiring 
behavioral change for a climate friendly city'. We will 
make this a regular event in the city. 

Partners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki,

Global learning

Crowdsourcing solutions

Climathon is a global 24-hour climate change workshop 
organized by Climate-KIC (Europe's largest climate 
change focused public-private innovation partnership). 

A Climathon is a hackathon type event which aims to 
help cities find innovative ways to tackle climate change 
and encourage people to take climate action in their city. 
Thessaloniki is the only Greek city participating in the 
network. Climathon Thessaloniki took place on October 
22-23 2016. It was co-organized by Resilient Thessaloniki, 
the Metropolitan Development Agency of Thessaloniki, 
Business and Cultural Development Center (KEPA), 
Students for Sustainability from the International Hellenic 
University, and Youthnest. 

It was hosted at OK!Thess and included 25 participants 
addressing the city’s challenge of “Inspiring behavior 
change for a climate-friendly city.” 

Participants worked with mentors and coaches, with 
experience in environmental and climate studies, 
technology and business.

After 24 hours of specialized workshops, collaboration, 
sessions with mentors, and dance and trivia game breaks, 
the participants produced the following proposals:

• 

ZeroHero is a fun mobile application through which 
people can track their personal energy footprint, 
compare it with their neighbors, create online 
communities within the local and global context, and 
learn how to decrease energy consumption through 
creative activities and fun tips.

• 

Ecothess draws links between environmental data 
(temperatures, air quality, etc.) and real-time events 

(urban floods, heat waves, etc.), highlighting the 
influence of climate change and raising residents’ 
awareness on the impact of climate change on city-
life.

SchoolGreens is a platform connecting the most 
creative and green schools with eco-friendly 
enterprises, helping them to design and pilot new 
models for climate friendly schools and communities 
together.

PatFoot connects the city’s consumers with local 
entrepreneurs and businesses offering eco-friendly 
products and services. This aims to highlight best 
practices within the city while developing an eco-
friendly consumer base.

A. Re-structure the role of Boroughs
B. Establish Boroughs as social labs 
C. Welcoming Thessaloniki
D. Foster youth participation 
E. Capitalize on Thessaloniki youth 
capital, invest in entrepreneurship and 
strengthen economic activity

Objective A: 
Re-structure the role of 
Boroughs

Boroughs currently have very limited authority and thus a weak 
impact on the development and progress of their districts. 

This is due both to the existing legal framework and their lack 
of capacity or expertise in undertaking complicated tasks and 
procedures. Yet Boroughs remain important intermediaries between 
the municipality and local residents. 

This role can be expanded through capacity building workshops 
followed by a campaign to re-introduce the Boroughs to the people. 
This will include a set of pilot projects of participatory governance 
at the district level. 

A set of pilot projects will introduce new methods of civic 
engagement, decentralize power, help the city to source local 
solutions to urban challenges, improve decision making at all levels 
of local governance and create a more efficient and inclusive local 
governance model, and improve trust and engagement between 
local authorities and citizens.

61

Action 01: 
Launch an awareness 
campaign introducing the role 
of the Borough to citizens 

Action 02: 
Establish a consultation 
process in the local Boroughs

According to existing legislation, each Borough 
council is required to hold deliberation meetings with 
the local community (neighborhood assembly) and 
contribute to shaping the City’s Development Plan by 
submitting a proposal to the City Council in a specific 
timeframe. 

The City Council is obliged to take into consideration 
the priorities suggested by the city’s Boroughs. 
Currently, this policy is partially implemented in some 
of the Municipalities of the Metropolitan Area but the 
overall process is deemed ineffective.

To streamline this process and assist the creation and 
approval of the City’s Development Plan, the city will 
create a meeting calendar and specific agenda, in 
collaboration with the Boroughs’ Directors and in line 
with local and national timeframes and requirements. 

Boroughs' deliberation meetings, are expected to 
empower citizens and encourage them to get involved 
in the co-creation of their urban environment.

Partners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, 
Boroughs

Timescale: Short Term

Status: New

Boroughs were established around 1980 with the aim 
of decentralizing the Municipality’s responsibilities 
and services. Boroughs consist of an elected Borough 
Council and a Borough President. 

Their responsibility is to serve the district’s residents, 
from being the intermediary between the citizens 
and local authorities, to ensuring the neighborhood’s 
emergency preparedness. 

A recent survey (Resilient Thessaloniki questionnaire) 
revealed that although the majority of city residents 
(82%) are aware of the existence of their local 
Borough, they are not clear on its role in response 
to certain issues. Consequently, they tend to submit 
requests and complaints directly to the central 
Municipal Departments which often results in delays 
due to bureaucracy. 

The city will initiate an awareness campaign to re-
introduce the role of the Boroughs to citizens. The 
first step will be the re-branding of the each Borough, 
in collaboration with local creative communities. 
This aims to bring the Boroughs closer to the 
neighborhood and transform their responsibility into 
a more inspiring and meaningful service that meets 
citizens’ needs. 

The city will use communication channels including 
local TV, radio, internet (websites, social media) 
to increase the effectiveness of the campaign and 
organize a kickoff event entitled the “Borough Open 
Day” in each of the 6 Boroughs of the city. 

By simplifying the communication of Boroughs' 
service offering and establishing the Boroughs as 
the “front - desk” for local public services, the city 
will create a more efficient and inclusive governance 
model.

Action 03: 
Initiate participatory 
budgeting in Boroughs 

Action 04: 
Create a portfolio of methods 
for Boroughs to enable 
community-led projects 

In collaboration with the Borough’s Council, the City 
will initiate a step-by-step process for establishing 
Participatory Budgeting in Boroughs. 

The project aims to put budget decisions directly 
in the hands of those directly affected: the local 
residents.

A year-long process including neighborhood 
assemblies will include the following steps: inform 
the community; develop, exchange and debate ideas; 
collaborate to turn ideas into proposals; evaluate and 
vote on the best projects which will receive funding. 

Under current legislation, a portion of the City budget 
is allocated to each Borough to finance activities such 
as campaigns, events and neighborhood projects. 
Boroughs must declare beforehand where and how 
the budget will be spent. 

Unfortunately, due to lacking resources, the money is 
not always spent most effectively. 

To tackle this, a portfolio of new methods and staff 
training sessions will be set up to help Borough staff 
design and deliver innovative services that will enable 
and facilitate community-led projects.

Action 05: 
Develop Borough Emergency 
Plans

Action 06: 
Establish June 20th as "City 
Resilience Day" 

In collaboration with the Boroughs, the city will build 
on existing city emergency plans to develop tailored 
emergency plans for each of the six Boroughs, taking 
into account their particular demographics, assets and 
resources. 

The plans will be developed according to the National 
Civil Protection Department Guidelines and involve 
participation from local schools, NGOs, and youth 
organizations.

Thessaloniki’s great earthquake of 20 June 1978 
caused the death of 50 people, injury of another 
220, and left thousands more to the homeless. Direct 
physical damage cost 1.2 billion euros. 

Almost 5% of buildings were classified as severely 
damaged, over 20% as moderately damaged, and 
75% were not damaged. In addition to the physical 
destruction, earthquake also contributed to significant 
psychological trauma for local residents. 

To raise public awareness and enhance emergency 
preparedness to future incidents, 20th of June will be 
recognized as the City’s Resilience Day. 

A city-wide event will be organized in collaboration 
with the Boroughs, local schools, NGOs, the Fire 
Department, Red Cross, and local artists and cultural 
institutions. 

It will take place at the waterfront, which is currently 
known as an emergency gathering point and will 
allow those responsible for the city’s emergency plan 
to showcase their work through interactive activities 
involving citizens. 

It will be designed to help citizens understand 
emergency procedures and learn how to prepare their 
own emergency plans. School fairs, concerts and art 
exhibitions will also be included in the event’s agenda.

Objective B: 
Establish Boroughs as 
social labs

In the past, community centers have not been needed or successful 
in Greece due to the predominance of informal social networks 
made-up of family members and friends. 

However, economic and social difficulties over the last few years 
have precipitated a change in mentality and local culture. People 
have created solidarity networks and new systems to share skills and 
resources. 

People are also demanding a more active role in city life, typically 
outside the traditional political structures. To meet these needs and 
increase civic participation, the City will invest in creating spaces for 
residents and civil society groups. 

Social labs will provide opportunities for neighborhoods to meet, 
work together, and foster new relationships. This will empower 
citizens and increase civic participation, contribute to creating 
cohesive communities, increase skills and enhance the impact of 
community groups and initiatives and create opportunities for 
networking and skills sharing.

Action 01: 
Leverage existing municipal assets and venues, converting 
them into flexible multi-use spaces to facilitate local 
community meetings and events

Borough administrative offices are currently hosted in 
Municipal buildings in central locations in each district. 
Buildings are usually landmarks and space within them 
is often underutilized. 

This action will create open, easily accessible and 
multi-use spaces within Borough buildings. These 
spaces will be used to deliver programs tailored to 
neighborhoods' needs. 

The potential uses of those spaces include a 
“Welcoming Thessaloniki” Center, with joint programs 
for immigrants and host communities, a “Local 
Educational Lab” involving skills building seminars and 

workshops for the local youth, and a “Community’s 
Co-working Space”, with facilities that promote 
networking and collaboration. 

Partners in action: Boroughs, Municipality of 
Thessaloniki, local NGOs, local, grass-roots initiatives

Action 02: 
Build capacity in citizen 
empowerment through 
collaboration with institutions 
and initiatives specialized in 
civic education 

Action 03: 
Create awareness campaign 
highlighting the importance 
of civic participation in local 
decision making processes 
(metropolitan scale) 

The Preliminary Resilient Assessment revealed that 
one of Thessaloniki’s “areas of strength” is community 
engagement. 

Although many residents are willing to participate in 
community activities, these often lack coordination 
causing participation (and projects' success) to 
decline over time. 

Through workshops with grassroots and community 
groups, the Resilient Thessaloniki team identified a 
need for training, networking and support from the 
local authorities to help empower citizens in local 
communities. 

Under this action, each Borough will forge 
partnerships with institutions and experts specializing 
in civic education. A series of workshops, seminars 
and consultation meetings will be held at the Borough 
Centers offering training to citizens. 

This will help them to sustain their groups, coordinate 
their actions, and reach out to a broader audience. 

This action will promote networking amongst 
grassroots and community initiatives, as well as team 
management and communication skills. This will 
help to strengthen local community resilience and 
empower citizens to take action.

Thessaloniki, civic education institutions, local NGO

Timescale: Short Term

Status: New

In line with Article 41 of the New Urban Agenda 
(Quito 2016), Thessaloniki is aiming to pursue a 
more participatory governance model by adopting 
processes that will allow meaningful and inclusive civic 
participation in decision-making, planning and follow-
up processes for citizens.

In spite of existing legislative provisions for public 
deliberations and mechanisms for co-production of 
the city planning, the existing communication gap 
between local authorities and civil society is leading 
to declining participation by citizens in local decision-
making. In an effort to combat citizens’ indifference, 
the ten Municipalities of Metropolitan Thessaloniki 
will collaborate to design and communicate a 
cohesive awareness campaign that demonstrates the 
importance of participation in matters that directly 
impact citizens' lives.

An inclusive communication strategy will be 
developed using Municipal channels such as local TV, 
radio, internet (website, social media). Information will 
also be produced and distributed in popular public 
spaces, at public events, and at educational meetings 
in local schools and Borough Centers. 

To increase the effectiveness of the campaign, 
well-respected public figures will be engaged as 
'Ambassadors of Civic Participation' to help share the 
message.

Objective C: 
Welcoming Thessaloniki

Migration and rapid demographic shifts can spark tension and 
create challenges, both for newcomers and long-time residents. 
The city’s population is diversifying; estimates suggest more than 
15% of the total refugee and immigrant population is located in 
the Metropolitan Area of Thessaloniki, 46% of whom are thought 
to be women and children. While many migrants are expected to 
relocate to other European cities, a significant number will also stay 
in the area. In response, the people of Thessaloniki have mobilized 
significantly, volunteering in refugee relief work and demonstrating 
a welcoming spirit. Many have reflected on their own family histories 
as refugees or migrants in previous generations. 

The City must address housing, education, employment, and 
health issues without creating competition or conflict between 
host communities and newcomers. We must empower everyone 
and create opportunities for economic revitalization and shared 
prosperity. 

To do so, the City will create a short and a long term integration 
action plan including programs for adult learning, vocational 
training, skills accreditation, language classes, internships, as well 
as cultural initiatives for refugees as well as long-term residents to 
ensure that interactions between existing residents and newcomers 
remain positive. Media campaigns and public discussions will deliver 
a message of unity and shared values for all residents of the city. 
Thessaloniki has proven itself a welcoming city throughout the 
centuries.

Welcoming Thessaloniki will increase social resilience and create 
cohesive communities, promote cultural diversity and help to 
integrate migrants and refugees, create opportunities for economic 
development and skills development, and improve economic self-
sufficiency and reduce the economic burden on the state.

Thessaloniki's Goals, Objectives and Actions68

Objective D: 
Foster youth participation

Youth participation in local decision-making is needed to build 
in youth insights to the planning of the city, while developing 
leadership skills. UN Habitat III's recently published New Urban 
Agenda urges cities to shift towards more inclusive and participatory 
models of decision making. Having won the Thessaloniki European 
Youth Capital Award 2014, the City is placing youth empowerment 
at the top of the agenda. 

Local stakeholders will develop a set of youth empowerment 
tools and policies based on existing local legislation, in line with 
recommendations from the Revised European Charter on the 
Participation of Young People in Local and Regional Life. 

Increasing youth's participation will empower young people and 
promote youth leadership, increase youth inclusion in local decision-
making, and increase data collection and knowledge of young 
people's issues. 

Action 01: 
Launch Thessaloniki Youth 
Resilience Challenge

The city will collaborate with local youth organizations 
and initiatives to coordinate a yearlong program to 
promote youth inclusion in local decision-making 
processes. 

The main objective is to empower the youth to 
become ambassadors of urban resilience and 
ensure they have a meaningful contribution in the 
implementation of Thessaloniki’s Resilient Strategy. 

The program will include workshops and meetings 
with young people at the local and national level 
and address environmental, economic and social 
challenges. 

Within the framework of the program, the city will 
pilot an e-participation tool aimed at collecting data 
and insights on current youth culture.

Award winning

Thessaloniki 
European Youth Capital

Thessaloniki was awarded the title of European Youth 
Capital (EYC), for the year 2014. This gave Thessaloniki 
the chance to showcase its youth-related cultural, 
social, political, and economic life through a multi-
faceted program. 

The EYC had a great impact on the city and provided 
Thessaloniki with a strong foundation for shaping a 
fertile environment to nurture youth empowerment 
and leadership. The city also gained valuable 
knowledge and experience in implementing youth-
oriented frameworks, organizing events and building 
partnerships that will be further expanded and 
capitalized the next years.

Action 02: 
Develop local youth policy 
(metropolitan scale) 

Action 03: 
Implement the Council of 
Europe's co-management 
system on youth

Based on a recent European Union Survey on Youth, 
Greece scores highly in educational attainment levels 
(88% compared to the European standard of 82%), 
in social inclusion (46% compared to the European 
standard of 29%), and in voting rates (73% compared 
to the European standard of 63%). 

However, on participation in organized voluntary 
activities, Greece ranks much lower than the European 
average. Clearly Greece's youth population has 
significant potential to contribute in this area, but 
forces such as poor resources and inappropriate 
frameworks and policies for involvement prevent it 
from doing so effectively. 

In line with the leading model of the Council of Europe 
and Young People, all matters related to youth will 
be decided by a joint Council composed of elected 
officials from the city, and elected representatives 
from the youth council. 

This will respond to the ongoing challenge that 
politicians cannot - or should not - make decisions 
that affect young people without their participation 
but young people cannot make decisions on youth 
issues without assistance from politicians. 

Partners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, Local 
youth organizations

Timescale: Long Term

Status: Aspirational

To tackle this issue, the city will invest in expanding 
the existing Municipal Entity for social services and 
youth (KEDITH) and found a Youth Center, to be 
located within the Borough Center. 

The city will also work with youth workers and NGOs 
to develop a framework aimed at facilitating youth 
empowerment and participation. 

According to the guidelines of the Quality Standards 
for Youth Policy, set by the European Youth Forum, 
the framework will include policies for: 

•  Setting criteria to recognize and approve youth 

organizations 

•  Establishing a committee/Department for Youth 

within the Municipality 

•  Establishing the city’s Youth Council (to be 

constituted of representatives from youth 
organizations and elected school councils) 

• 

Institutionalizing a youth budget

Objective E: 
Capitalize on Thessaloniki 
youth capital, invest in 
entrepreneurship and 
strengthen economic 
activity

Thessaloniki has the largest youth population in Greece, hosting 
around 150,000 students each year through academic institutions, 
private, and vocational training colleges. 

However, in 2014 youth unemployment was around 50% and 
between 2008 and 2016, more than 400,000 people left Greece 
to study or work abroad. Clearly there is a disconnect between 
academia and the local economy and job market. 

We need to understand what support young people need in terms of 
educational programs, internships and apprenticeship opportunities, 
careers advice, entrepreneurial learning and experience, skills, and 
early professional development. 

The municipality along with stakeholders in education, academia 
and the private sector will provide a programme of support to young 
people to help them move from education to career pathways. 

To nurture, maintain and leverage talent and drive the local economy, 
we will provide new services, products and solutions for the city, 
to develop youth skills and enhance employment opportunities, 
improve the local economy and reduce brain-drain, and create jobs, 
skills and economic prosperity for all.

Action 03: 
Establish an "Education to 
Career" consortium

Conduct a survey/poll of current students and alumni 
across universities and colleges in the city, to better 
understand their interests, needs, skills, passions and 
goals. 

This consortium will include municipalities, academic 
institutions, primary and secondary educational 
networks, private sector stakeholders, and training

Thessaloniki's Goals, Objectives and Actions78

Objective F: 
Invest in intergenerational 
linkages in local 
communities

Despite the presence of many young people and students in 
Thessaloniki, the city’s population is ageing. Over the past decade 
(2005-2014), the number of over 65 years olds increased as a 
proportion of the total population from 15%-18%. 

Inspired by similar approaches in cities around the globe, 
Thessaloniki will enhance intergenerational social interaction 
through partnerships between social and educational institutions 
on various themes (volunteerism, skills development and sharing, 
cultural development, health and well-being). Older citizens have 
the potential to inspire younger generations in relation to active 
citizenship. 

This will strengthen social cohesion and build community resilience, 
increase civic participation, increase collaborative working and 
knowledge exchange, and increase literacy and youth skills 
development.

Thessaloniki's Goals, Objectives and Actions80

Objective G: 
Co-creation of inclusive 
open spaces

Community involvement in the planning and maintaining of public spaces 
is vital to ensure they are sustainable and fit for purpose. Given that 
Thessaloniki has limited resources for urban regeneration investments, 
as well as a history of vandalism of public spaces, we need to empower 
citizens to take responsibility for these assets. We will establish a program 
of citizen participation in all stages of planning through to management of 
public spaces. 

We will draft a policy framework to help the City collaborate with citizens 
and community groups to create and maintain accessible public spaces. 
This will result in cost-effective and better designed public spaces. It will 
also help to develop civic consciousness and ensures that issues of inclusion 
and accessibility are incorporated in the design of public space though the 
participation of different social groups.

Action 01: 
Adopt a public space 
co-creation policy

We will design a streamlined public space activation 
and stewardship policy. This will enrich the city’s 
public spaces and improve social cohesion. The policy 
will include parameters and “rules of engagement” 
that clearly define roles for the co-creation and 
stewardship of events and spaces. 

The policy will include a manual to guide city and civil 
leaders on how to collaborate on a range of event 
and programming activities and stewardship models 
to promote, sustain, and increase social cohesion in 
public spaces. 

The manual will be supported by the co-creation 
policy and include best practice examples, tools, 
and process guidance demonstrations to assist civil 
society groups to develop and implement public 
space projects.

Featured project

Tactical Urbanism co-creation policy 
+ guide 

The city will partner with Street Plans (an urban 
planning, design, and research/advocacy firm in the 
US) to institutionalize city/citizen co-ownership and 
activate public space through a tactical urbanism co-
creation policy and guide. Tactical urbanism is a city 
and/or citizen-led approach to neighborhood building 
using short-term, low-cost and scalable interventions to 
catalyze long-term change.

To address the city’s shortage of open space and lack 
of cohesion between citizens and their government, 
we need a new policy and guidance framework to 
facilitate self-organization of public space stewardship. 
The framework seeks to increase social cohesion and 
organizational capacity at the neighborhood scale, 
allowing civil society to contribute to the city program 
and create vibrant public spaces.

Featured Project: Community-led Demonstration 
Project Policy and Guide, City of Burlington, (New 
Jersey, USA).

Street Plans prepared a co-creation framework for 
the city of Burlington, through a collaborative process 
involving city agencies and local people.

Working with the city and a local NGO, Street Plans 
developed two Tactical Urbanism demonstration 
projects to illustrate the potential for better bike and 
pedestrian infrastructure using temporary and low-
cost materials. 

These were conducted in partnership with local events 
(Art Hop and Open Streets BTV) to maximize their 
impact and exposure to the public. The project team 
then worked on early network designs, based on 
feedback from the events.

“

The project team then worked on early network 
designs, based on feedback from the events. 
Public engagement events also across the city. 

This policy aims to make it easier for everyday 
residents, advocacy organizations, and 
community groups to spearhead short-term 
demonstration projects alongside the city 
departments and other agencies.

Action 02: 
Deliver a public space pilot 
project

Action 03: 
Launch the Open Schools - Pilot 
Project

We will develop a pilot project designed to build social 
cohesion whilst testing the draft policy framework and 
manual guidance. 

The pilot project will be used to further engage city/
civil society partners and identify any shortcomings in 
the policy or additional guidance to be included in the 
public space co-creation manual.

Once these learnings are integrated, the city will roll 
out the policy and manual across the city.

Partners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki, Tactical 
Urbanism, local grassroot initiatives, AUTH

Timescale: Short Term

Status: Planned

Thessaloniki lacks of sufficient open public spaces 
for the citizens to use and enjoy due to the City’s 
densely built urban fabric. At a neighborhood scale, 
the number of parks, outdoor multi-sport courts and 
playgrounds, does not correspond to the number 
of its residents. Parents have been raising this issue 
at community meetings and surveys linking it to 
the increasing trend of families moving to adjacent 
Municipalities and thus contributing to the city’s 
problem of ageing population. 

Thessaloniki suffers from a lack of open public spaces 
for use by the community, primarily due to the densely 
built urban fabric. The number of open spaces at 
neighborhood scale is insufficient for the total number 
of residents. This is causing families to move to 
adjacent municipalities seeking better quality of life, 
thus aggravating the ageing population problem in 
the city.

Despite the abundance and size of the school 
playgrounds, they are not accessible outside school 
hours. 

Opening up the school playgrounds will be a key 
action towards providing sufficient open spaces 
for the neighborhood, where they can function as 
gathering outdoor space for the neighborhood’s 
residents of all ages, strengthening the community’s 
social cohesion. 

In December 2016, the City announced a pilot 
project entitled ‘Open School’, collaborating with 
the Ministry’s Primary Education Division in six local 
Primary Schools and cultural institutions in order to 
develop an inclusive program and management plan 
for the project. During the first phase, the City will 
facilitate the management of the selected spaces, 
however the success of the pilot project will reply on 
the involvement of the residents in maintaining these 
spaces.

Objective H: 
Nature based solutions for 
green neighborhoods

Thessaloniki has a dense urban structure with limited open and 
green spaces. It also has ageing building stock and extreme weather 
conditions including high temperatures during the summer and 
intense rainfall during the winter compound. These conditions are 
more evident in poorer neighborhoods, where building stock is often 
poorly maintained.

To address environmental impacts on the city, we will develop the 
limited open spaces while creating spaces for social interaction. We 
will implement a combination of bottom-up and top-down solutions 
including green infrastructure (permeable surfaces, rain gardens, 
and green walls to manage storm water and mitigate the heat island 
effect) and low cost solutions such as urban agriculture in inner 
courtyards, and on private balconies and rooftops. 

Nature based-solutions will help to harness the power and 
sophistication of nature to turn environmental, social and economic 
challenges into opportunities. These solutions will contribute to 
creating green growth and “future-proofing” our society, as well as 
enhancing citizen well-being, and providing business opportunities. 
By creating multiple benefits for human health, the economy, 
society, and the environment, nature-based solutions represent more 
efficient and cost-effective solutions than traditional approaches – 
something particularly important during times of fiscal austerity.

Action 01: 
Create a new natural landscape 
within the built environment

We will develop a sidewalk bioswale network to collect 
stormwater. This will contribute to the reduction of 
heat risks and carbon emissions in the city. It will also 
provide habitats for urban fauna. 

The bioswale sidewalk network will help to connect 
the city's cultural sites including the Roman Forum 
and Eptapirgio Castle. 

The creation of green routes linking places of cultural 
and leisure interest will enhance the spatial quality of 
the city while increasing the local sense of identity and 

increasing the attractiveness of cultural heritage sites. 
Cycle lanes may also be added, increasing carbon-free 
urban transportation routes.

Objective I: 
Child friendly city

Thessaloniki is a youthful city, thanks to its large student population. 
However, the number of families with young children living in the 
city is decreasing, with many moving to the suburbs outside the city. 

We believe that creating the conditions to maintain and increase 
the number of families with children will help to maintain a diverse 
urban environment for all. 

To do so, we will introduce a child friendly agenda to the urban 
development of the city. This will include high quality playgrounds, 
urban design approaches that consider the particular needs of the 
child, safe routes to school, new school infrastructure, implementing 
nature-based solution in schools yards, opening schools to the 
community outside of teaching hours, and creating community 
center libraries for children. 

A Child Friendly City will be aligned with the city's efforts to create 
intergenerational linkages, in consideration of the fact that there is a 
high rate of seniors caring for children in the city. 

The needs of this demographic must therefore be considered in the 
design and delivery of child and family-focused solutions. 

A Child Friendly City will develop active and engaged citizens, 
improve the health and well-being, create inclusive spaces for all, 
improve the quality of life in the City, and attract and maintain 
diverse, multi-generational communities.

Action 02: 
Establish a safe routes to 
school scheme

Action 03: 
Launch the 'Play Streets' 
Project

Based on the ongoing program “School zone for 
safer access to schools”, we will work with the school 
community to establish a Safe Routes to School 
Scheme. This will enable more young people to walk 
and cycle to school by improving urban conditions 
and actively involving schools in to the process. 

We will develop the scheme using e-participation 
tools to crowdsource data, a set of physical measures 
and policies to improve urban conditions and a series 
of public awareness and civic participation campaigns.

The city will extend the ongoing Open School Project 
outside of the school yard boundaries and initiate a 
Pilot Play Street Project. The City will collaborate with 
local Schools and Borough Councils to coordinate and 
manage the project. 

The “Play Street” concept involves the closure of 
certain streets to traffic during a few hours a month, 
allowing children to play out more safely, and 
neighbors to come together and have the opportunity 
to interact. 

The measures and processes employed for the 
implementation of Safe Routes to School provide 
benefits for the neighborhood in many aspects. 

Through-traffic in the selected streets is redirected 
but people living there can still drive in and out slowly, 
guided by volunteer steward-parents. 

Firstly, it addresses the children’s specific needs as 
a user of public space, it significantly contributes to 
achieving enjoyable public spaces by having a real 
impact on local air quality and traffic volume and 
it empowers citizens to actively contribute in the 
decision-making process. This action will be also 
linked to the establishment of low emission zones. 

Adults (with and without children) and children are 
encouraged to join the event and play an active role 
by volunteering to “steward” road closures.

San Francisco Safe Routes to School

The San Francisco Safe Routes to Schools (SRTS) 
Partnership, led by the San Francisco Department of 
Public Health, supports and encourages families to walk 
and cycle to school every day. Walking, biking, and taking 
public transport to school currently make up 44% of 
trips to the 35 public schools that are part of the SRTS 
program. 

Internationally, SRTS Programs use a comprehensive 
model – known as the 5Es - to make walking and cycling 
to school safer and more accessible for children, including 
those with disabilities. The 5 Es include:

Education

• 

• 

Educate classes about pedestrian safety

Educate classes about bicycle safety

•  Distribute traffic safety packets to drivers near 

schools

•  Distribute walk & bike maps for students specific to 

schools

“

Making it safe and fun for SF youth to walk and 
bike to school.

”

Encouragement

•  Organize International Walk to School Day events 

(First Wednesday of October)

•  Organize San Francisco Bike to School Days (April)

Engineering

•  Conduct walk and bike audits at schools

• 

Install bike racks at schools

Enforcement

• 

• 

Enforce traffic laws around schools

Install 15 MPH School Zone signs

•  Utilize speed radar signs near schools

Evaluation

•  Collect and analyze how schoolchildren get to and

Objective A: 
Urban economy policy 
agenda 

The three foundational components of the urban economy are 
employment, productivity, and urban finance. These are interlinked 
and influence one other. However, there is limited understanding or 
assessment of these linkages in Thessaloniki. 

Understanding the detailed composition of the economic structure 
of the metropolitan area is a necessary first step to deciding how to 
improve the productivity of individual sectors, firms, and the city’s 
economy as a whole. 

This policy agenda will focus on the productivity of the urban 
economy and its distributional consequences for poverty and 
inequality, while understanding which “local” characteristics of the 
city can have wider spatial and macro-economic effects. 

This will help develop effective and long-term strategies to support 
priority sectors and economic clusters, diversify the economy and 
prepare it for future global economic shocks, develop economic and 
employment opportunities, and support cross-sector collaboration 
and shared learning.

Action 01: 
Develop an urban economy 
policy agenda

We will develop a comprehensive, long-term policy 
agenda focusing on employment, productivity, urban 
finance, and their interlinkages at the metropolitan 
level. 

This will include priorities, targets and measurement 
actions, and build on the Municipality's draft Urban 
Economic Development Plan. 

This will help the city's municipalities prioritize 
sectors in which the city should invest for the greatest 
employment and productivity outcomes.

Action 02: 
Initiate an urban economy 
assessment in Thessaloniki's 
metropolitan area

Action 03: 
Develop skills and training 
opportunities for independent 
or freelance workers 

An estimated 20-30% of the working-age population 
in the EU and US engage in some form of independent 
work, according to a McKinsey Global Institute 
survey. As our local economy changes and diversifies, 
a growing number of people are doing freelance, 
independent, or part-time work, and some are 
participating in sharing economy models that are 
beginning to appear locally. 

To help these sectors, we will: 1) Develop a network 
of local partners to launch workshops, seminars 
and training programs in support of independent 
workers, from high-skilled workers in the consulting 
and technology field to the lower-skilled. This will 
focus on providing digital skills, financial education, 
advice on working with international clients, tools 
for remote work, and more; 2) Co-organize events to 
explore issues related to the independent workforce 
and inform educators, career centers, accountants, 
and others on how to best serve and support this 
workforce; and 3) Support local solutions (training 
platforms, networking initiatives, etc.) and showcase 
global solutions for empowering and safeguarding this 
workforce.

Timescale: Short Term

Status: New

We will develop an urban economy assessment 
including:

1. A cross-sector analysis with an inventory of firms in 
each sector, identifying measures that can increase 
the demand for labor and youth employment.

2. An annual business survey, conducted by an 
independent partner, to contribute to the cross-sector 
analysis and link with existing and emerging sectors or 
economic clusters in the city's economy. For example, 
if creative industries are emerging in the city, the 
survey should also seek to identify how many firms 
have a significant number of employees, research, or 
products/services related to the creative economy. 
This will provide the city with a fuller picture of the 
existing scale and growth potential of a given sector. 

3. A detailed analysis of the informal sector: its 
organization, the goods and services it produces, 
the skills and other inputs which are used, and how 
informally produced goods and services find their way 
into wider markets. A detailed analysis of independent 
work (freelance, contract-based, sharing economy, 
etc.), including tracking data, trends and projections. 

4. An assessment of the environmental factors 
affecting firms' success, with a focus on the sectors of 
Tourism, Creative Industries, High-Tech, and Software 
Engineering, to help the city better define regulations 
and policies that contribute to the success of firms 
with high impact on employment, innovation and 
growth.

The power of the city’s creative and cultural economy

Thessaloniki is internationally recognized for its dynamic 
creative sector. The city has pioneered graphic design 
since the 1980s.

In 2012, Creativity For.Th initiated the first collaboration 
between the municipality and local actors, strengthening 
the role of the city’s creative economy in the formation 
of its contemporary identity. The municipality also 
established LABattoir, an applied creativity laboratory 
housed in a refurbished old slaughterhouse building in 
the west of the city, near the Port.

There are 25 programs bringing together public, 
private, and cultural institutions working in the creative 
industries. Most are multi-event, and many launched in 
the last few years during the economic recession;

The creative economy has a combined budget of more 
than 2 million EUR from national and international funds, 
and a network of local companies with revenues ranging 
from 150,000 – 16 million EUR;

There are approximately 150 partnerships, including: 
schools, museums, universities, cities abroad, public-
benefit foundations based in Athens, industry and 
business associations, Greece-European bi-lateral 
chambers of commerce, banks, the Ministry of Culture, 
European national institutes of culture, and more;

There are more than 100,000 direct and indirect 
beneficiaries, including artists, creators, creatives, 
designers, entrepreneurs, urbanists, freelancers, 
students, researchers, residents and tourists.

Recommendations to support the emerging creative 
and cultural economy:

• 

Better data collection at the city level and in 
partnership with the municipality to encourage 
more European programs, funding and international 
festivals to connect with the city’s creative talent, 
economy and society.

•  A city-level strategy, including actions to facilitate 

international ties and connect local creative 
professionals with leading businesses such as large 
hotels.

• 

Support from municipalities to increase collaboration 
and make more event spaces like LABattoir available. 
This will create more international networking and 
collaboration opportunities and help to reach new 
partners, artists, creatives, experts, and markets.

Action 05: 
Design a campaign promoting 
the city's identity as a 
knowledge and human talent 
hub

Action 06: 
Launch a regional 
development fund, including 
an impact investment fund

Thessaloniki already has many of the elements of 
a regional hub, including learning and academia; a 
high concentration of people with higher education 
degrees; an attractive geography; connectivity as 
a logistics hub for the region through its port and 
national highway (Egnatia); and a growing number of 
international events. 

To support these attributes, this campaign will build 
on existing initiatives such as Thessaloniki Innovation 
Friendly Destination, and include a consortium of 
partners, materials, success stories, and international 
outreach to attract partners and global gatherings. 

These efforts will align with the Study in Thessaloniki 
initiative and roadshows as well as the city's tourism 
strategy.

This fund will be designed in consultation with 
stakeholders, SMEs and citizen networks in the city, 
and in collaboration with nearby cities and small 
towns. 

It will recognize the urban economy assessment and 
address Thessaloniki's local urban economy priorities 
and trends. 

This will make it better equipped to: 1) boost the role 
of SMEs, micro-enterprises, micro-manufacturers, and 
self-employed; 2) recognize and support emerging 
sectors, 3) improve local businesses' access to finance; 
and 4) ensure transparency in financial management, 
and encourage further investment from national and 
international funds and investors. 

This fund will be launched in collaboration with 
a leading Greek bank and the Hellenic Fund for 
Entrepreneurship and Development. 

It will also include a strategy and fund for Impact 
Investing.

Objective B: 
Local cluster economic 
activities 

Thessaloniki's traditional economy included a mix of activities 
including a food market, flower market, jewelry district and so on. 
In recent years, these clusters either disappeared due to changes in 
the economic structure of the city or transformed into new areas of 
economic development, mostly related to leisure and services. New 
activities in the creative industries sector have now also appeared, 
which have helped to rejuvenate these areas of the city. 

To support these industries, the City must identify new spatial 
arrangements and seek solutions to protect, enable and 
promote these clusters (both existing and emerging) based on 
new governance and urban planning models (e.g. the Business 
Improvement District model). In addition to the spatial clustering of 
economic activities on a micro-scale, there are clusters at the macro-
scale. In the national economy, the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki 
is recognized as a hub for creative activities and networks, including 
graphic and industrial design, and even music. 

We will create a tool-box of policies to strengthen these economic 
clusters. We will also pilot alternative solutions and models to 
enhance productivity, develop effective and long-term strategies to 
support priority sectors and economic clusters, enhance productivity 
and develop new economic and employment opportunities , 
facilitate new partnership opportunities, and strengthen multi-
stakeholder collaboration.

Action 01: 
Introduce decision-making and 
integrated planning models for 
commercial districts

As urban issues grow in scale and complexity, 
governance arrangements and stakeholder decision-
making mechanisms must adjust to facilitate 
collaboration and adaptable action. 

There are a number of factors affecting local 
businesses over which they have little or no control. 
These include: customer perceptions of the area, 
parking policy, street management, vacant units, and 
the lack of promotional opportunities.

The establishment of Business Improvement Districts 
(BIDs) can help increase certainty for businesses 
around some of these issues. BIDs are legally 
and geographically defined partnerships for area 
improvement and service delivery, funded by levy-
paying businesses within an agreed boundary. 

They are managed and operated by a BID Company 
– usually a non-profit company run by and for 
its members. Businesses set priorities for local 
investment to be used only in the place where they do

business. BIDs can bring regeneration benefits locally 
for the whole community and regionally for the wider 
economy by attracting additional funding – such as 
public realm and infrastructure improvements – and 
increasing footfall and staff retention through place 
promotion and economic development. 

Partnership working can bring benefits like saving 
businesses money by joint procurement, reducing 
crime, building local networks and supporting local 
supply chains, and giving businesses a stronger voice 
within their local municipality.

Regenerating traditional urban markets 
in the city center: Kapani Agora 

The power of public markets to impact 
communities: the case of Barcelona 

Barcelona has a network of more than 40 public 
markets. Every neighborhood has its own, each serving 
approximately 25,000 residents. The markets collectively 
provide over 7,500 jobs serving 1.6 million people 
through 65 million visits per year and a €1 billion in 
turnover. Barcelona made the conscious decision to use 
its markets to revitalize the city. From 2011-2015, the city 
invested €133 million in market renovations; 25 markets 
have now undergone major restorations. Barcelona 
saw this as an opportunity to reinforce social cohesion, 
improve environmental conditions, boost tourism, and 
contribute to the city’s global reputation as a hub for 
food culture.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence in interest 
and renewed appreciation for public markets. Public 
markets contribute to urban revitalization. They also play 
a central role in community life and diversity, contribute 
to better public health outcomes, and strengthen links 
between rural and urban economies. 

The historic part of Thessaloniki’s city center contains 
four markets and more than 800 small businesses, 
including Kapani Agora, the oldest open market in the 
city. In recent years, the markets have seen a decline 
in visitors and trade due to the economic recession. 
However, there has also been an increase in the 
number of creative professionals, business owners and 
freelancers locating in the area.

In 2016, local business owners launched a new brand 
identity and visual logo for Kapani, created through 
inclusive design processes with local partners. We believe 
the market has the potential to lead the regeneration 
of the historic markets, and contribute to the wider 
regeneration of the city center. This design project 
signifies a modest start in that direction, contributing 
to place-making and community engagement that will 
benefit all of Thessaloniki.

As part of the medium and long-term strategy to 
regenerate the historic markets, we will establish a 
Business Improvement District (BID) and develop an 
Integrated Market Redevelopment Strategy for the area.

Partners include the Professional Association of the 
Historic City Center, Business and Cultural Development 
Center (KEPA), Design for Europe, the Design Council, 
Resilient Thessaloniki, Youthnest, and Creativity Platform.

Objective C: 
New cross-sector 
partnerships

The needs of our communities and citizens are changing rapidly. 
To improve the quality and delivery of city services, we will work 
with stakeholders from the private, academic and civil society 
sectors to form new partnerships that make the most effective use 
of limited resources, create positive impacts and unlock creativity 
and innovation in the areas of education, urban development, 
technology, energy, climate adaptation, health and more. We have 
already developed strong and productive partnerships relating to 
the co-design and delivery of new social and cultural services. 

We will build on these successes to further develop new cross-
sector partnership opportunities, strengthen multi-stakeholder 
collaboration, strengthen social cohesion and build community 
resilience, develop new economic and employment opportunities, 
and promote co-creation of city strategies and services.

Action 01: 
Develop an Anchor Institution 
engagement strategys

Anchor Institutions are non-profit institutions with 
strong ties to the geographic area where they are 
located. 

They tend to be large employers, and focus on 
promoting business growth and the local economy. 
In Thessaloniki, this includes universities, colleges, 
hospitals and cultural institutions. 

We will develop an engagement strategy through 
consultation and co-creation with our own anchor 
institutions. 

This will incorporate best practices and approaches 
particularly based on US cities that have significant 
experience in this area. 

The strategy will focus on education, employability 
and community development and impact, and include 
common commitments for amplifying institutions' 
local impact, such as to seek local entrepreneurs in 
procurement efforts, and encourage programs that 
work with local communities to solve local challenges.

Triple-Helix or Quadruple-

Stakeholders: public, private

There are two ways to structure this model: 1) Society is treated as the recipient of 
a service, and the design and development responsibilities lie with experts in the 
triple helix (public, private, academic sectors); 2) Civil society actors are part of the 
scheme development process. They actively engage by expressing what their needs 
are and brainstorming ideas. In certain cases, they may even voluntarily provide data 
and information to help other partners in the quadruple-helix to understand citizens’ 
behaviors and needs.

Pay-for-Success/  Social 
I m p a c t   B o n d s /   H u m a n 
Capital Performance Bonds

Stakeholders: government, 
private funders (investment 
banks etc)

Social Impact bonds, also known as pay-for-success financing, are performance 
contracts between the government and private funders (e.g. investment banks). In 
projects financed by social impact bonds, the private sector is responsible for financing 
and implementing a social service (e.g. school, community development, correctional 
facility, etc.) and will only receive repayments by the government if prescribed, 
quantified performance metrics are met. In order to stay objective and impartial, a 
third-party independent appraiser will monitor and report how well the private sector 
has achieved the performance metrics.

Collective Impact Initiatives

Stakeholders: Funders 
(philanthropic and other), 
nonprofits, civil society and 
community organizations, 
private sector, academia. 

S o c i a l   D e v e l o p m e n t 
Partnerships 

Stakeholders: Local 
authorities, civil society /

Collective Impact iis a new approach to adaptive problem-solving. This includes the 
commitment of a group of actors from different sectors to a common agenda and 
specific problem, using common indicators and data to track progress.

This is a new partnership model for local governments and civil society that started 
in Greece in 2016. In it, municipalities identify services to outsource (social services, 
management of parks, public spaces and cultural institutions, sanitation, etc), and 
establish partnerships to source these services from social cooperatives or social-
benefit enterprises.

Objective D: 
Metropolitan collaboration

€

For Thessaloniki to respond effectively to the challenges it faces 
and develop opportunities, we need more effective coordination 
between institutions at the metropolitan scale. 

Given the absence of an institutionalized Metropolitan Governance 
System at the local level, we also need to create a metropolitan 
partnership system by using existing governance tools (i.e. 
development agencies, MoUs, etc.). 

The coordination of metropolitan development (cooperation, 
consultation, negotiation and decision-making) involves public, 
private and social sector stakeholders. 

We will therefore establish a polycentric system that respects and 
maintains the identity of individual municipalities internally, while 
presenting a collective metropolitan identity externally. This will 
support:

• Collective efforts instead of competition in the economic, social, 
cultural and urban development of the city 

• Collective leveraging of resources and usage of available financial 
instruments 

• Synergies in developing international programs 

• Added value of the assets and comparative advantages of all 
Municipalities (using the city's brand name and external economy 
and partnerships). 

This will develop new economic and employment opportunities, 
promote co-creation of city strategies and services, promote 
spatially equitable urban development and collective efforts 
in environmental protection and risk reduction, strengthen 
multi-stakeholder collaboration and facilitate new partnership 
opportunities.

100 Resilient Cities | Thessaloniki Resilience Strategy

Action 01: 
Create a system of technical 
assistance to support the 
metropolitan Municipalities 

Action 02: 
Develop a long term Resilience 
Strategy for the Metropolitan 
Area of Thessaloniki

Greek municipalities are dependent on European 
funding for many of their urban investments. To secure 
funding the municipalities of the Metropolitan Area 
must compete with one other. 

While the current institutional framework obliges 
every Municipality to create a 5-year Operational Plan, 
there is no provision for the establishment of a long-
term city strategy. 

This process has led to piecemeal interventions 
across the Metropolitan Area, lack of procedural 
transparency, and unproductive competition between 
municipalities. 

However, in preparing the current Resilience Strategy, 
the Municipality of Thessaloniki has sought to engage 
other Municipalities in the Metropolitan Area through 
the Metropolitan Development Agency of Thessaloniki. 

To tackle this, the Metropolitan Development Agency 
of Thessaloniki in collaboration with the Management 
Organization unit for Development Projects of the 
Ministry of Economy initiated a metropolitan program 
to help the Municipalities of Thessaloniki identify 
collaborative opportunities, synthesize activities and 
priorities. 

This will also support the creation of a Metropolitan 
Operational Plan for Thessaloniki with funding from a 
variety of sources. Capacity building workshops and 
thematic co-design sessions supported by the Office 
of Resilience will further assist this process.

Partners in action: Metropolitan Development Agency 
of Thessaloniki, Management Organization unit for 
Development Project of the Ministry of Economy

Timescale: Short Term

Status: Ongoing

Consequently, the Resilience Strategy addresses 
challenges facing both the city and the Metropolitan 
Area. Next, we will extend this process, ensuring that 
issues of urban resilience are addressed in a holistic 
and integrated manner across the city, despite the 
lack of an official metropolitan governance structure. 

Creating a Resilience Strategy for the Metropolitan 
Area of Thessaloniki will unlock new opportunities 
for intermunicipal collaboration and provide added 
value to existing initiatives and actions creating 
interdependent systems and networks.

Tourism is an important contributor to the local 
economy. During their visit to the city, tourists tend 
not to leave the historical center, despite there being 
numerous historical and cultural sites and landmarks 
in close adjacent municipalities in the Metropolitan 
Area. To take advantage of opportunities in tourism, 
we will create an holistic tourism strategy for all the 
whole Metropolitan Area.

This aims to attract more tourists for longer visits, 
creating new economic opportunities and enhancing 
the city's brand. 

We will also diversify our tourism offering, providing 
inclusive and accessible tourism, environmentally

Action 04: 
Creating a Metropolitan Land 
Bank

Given the density of private land, there is little 
opportunity to develop open spaces or socially-
oriented infrastructure in Thessaloniki. 

By contrast, the metropolitan area comprises a variety 
of development characteristics. To take advantage of 
these, we will develop a Metropolitan Land Bank. 

This will establish a mechanism of land rights 
management to help release space for public use 
without compromising the rights of the private owner. 
It will also create opportunities for urban development 
in other areas.

Objective E: 
Performance-based 
management 

€

A Municipality consists of several interlocking components including:

• Management – which refers to operations, including information 
and communication technology and other systems, and delivery of 
products and services to constituents. 

• Finance – which includes revenue collection and expenditure, fiscal 
policies and practices. Finance also refers to a city’s ability to secure 
additional capital. 

• Governance – which encompasses leadership, decision-making 
structures, and processes for implementing decisions, laws and 
regulations.

Since 2011, Thessaloniki has implemented a holistic administrative 
reform plan with a view to creating a more efficient, robust and 
flexible municipal system of governance. As such, Thessaloniki was 
selected as one of six pilot cities to participate in the European 
Commission’s “Task Force” program for administrative reform. On 
the back of this, we will establish a “Results-based management” 
(RBM) system to identify goals and objectives for different 
departments, in addition to a systematic engagement methodology. 

This will improve the quality and delivery of city services, unlock 
opportunities for inter-municipal and departmental collaboration 
and integrated planning procedures, develop effective and long-term 
strategies to support priority sectors and economic clusters, enhance 
economic prosperity, and improve transparency and cost effectiveness.

Action 01: 
Launch a performance-based 
management system

We will establish a performance based management 
system to undertake the following steps: 

• Identify specific overall goals and mission 

• Establish standards and short- and longer-term 
performance measures related to those goals

• Create a baseline of current performance relative to 
those standards

• Monitor performance against standards on a regular 
basis (e.g. weekly) 

• Modify government activities and program design, 
as needed, to enhance performance

• Use specific city departments as pilot cases

• Report progress on performance measures to the 
City Council, citizens and other stakeholders.

Objective F: 
Financial resilience

Severe economic austerity has significantly impacted on city 
revenues and created financial instability nationwide. It is therefore 
critical that we develop the city’s financial resilience by adopting 
modern methods of financial management in conjunction with 
policies of inter-municipal cooperation. 

This approach will yield significant savings, without reducing the 
quantity or quality of public services.

Action 01: 
Develop a plan to improve 
revenue collection

First, we will perform an analysis of revenue source 
potential. We will then rank the revenue sources by 
actual size and estimate the “potential” revenue that 
could be obtained.

Next, we will identify improvement actions in relation 
to the top priority revenue sources for improvement. 
We will also review underlying problems such as fees 
not billed/collected and services not charged. We will 
identify the types of actions required to tackle these 
problems (e.g. better supervision, better staff training, 
new systems, new equipment, etc.) and the time and 
cost associated with each type of action.

Action 02: 
Create a Real Estate Portfolio 
Strategy

This action includes a detailed review of the city's 
real estate portfolio to identify utilization efficiencies, 
asset monetization opportunities (e.g. redevelopment 
or disposition), and potential cost saving strategies for 
the municipality. 

The analysis will segment the portfolio into distinct 
classifications of assets (e.g. office, operation centers, 
geography, specialty, etc.); allocate personnel 

Finally, we will develop an action plan and classify 
each priority revenue source into immediate, mid-term 
and long-term actions.

Action 03: 
Improve liquidity management 

We will improve liquidity management by identifying 
the historical time patterns of revenue receipts and 
expenditure requirements. 

This will help us to close liquidity gaps before they 
occur. We will construct an operating revenue flow 
model that shows the average cumulative revenue 
from all large sources over the past five years on a 
month-by-month basis. 

Then by averaging the month-by-month operating 
expenditures over the last five years, we will compare 
the cumulative expenditures to the cumulative 
revenues in each month. 

This will allow us to identify the months when it is 
most likely that the City will run short of cash to pay 
its bills and the level of this cash shortage during each 
liquidity gap.

Action 04:

Financial Management 
Assessment

To access long-term financing, the city must 
demonstrate its creditworthiness to lenders, investors

We will therefore conduct a self-assessment 
of financial management addressing payment 
compliance and the conditions of public expenditure, 
procurement, financial accountability systems and 
debt management systems.

Objective G: 
Municipal capital 
investment plan

The City has a very limited capacity for urban investments and relies 
heavily on European funding for new urban projects. 

To increase longterm resilience, we must diversify our funding 
sources and leverage private investments through new partnerships. 
We must also integrate capital investment planning into local 
development planning (5-year Operational Plan). The Capital 
Investment Plan will be transparent to civil society, and link to other 
capital budgets and financial planning processes. 

This will improve financial planning mechanisms, develop effective 
and long-term strategies to support priority sectors and economic 
clusters, identify opportunities to increase city revenues and make 
cost savings, and enhance economic prosperity.

Action 01: 
Create a 5-year Capital 
Investment Plan

We will build on the existing 5-year Operational 
Plan to develop a Capital Investment Action Plan 
addressing proposed PPPs and capital projects of 
high value. 

It will also allow multiple participants to evaluate the 
performance of proposed capital projects.

Partners in action: Municipality of Thessaloniki

This will include design planning procedures to 
understand the full value and realize the full costs of 
capital investments, which will allow us to plan for 
investments in a fiscally prudent and creditworthy 
manner.

Objective H: 
Local risk reduction and 
risk management systems

Thessaloniki is exposed to extreme weather conditions such as 
earthquakes, flooding, forest fires, snow, and heat waves. These 
events interrupt city services and business continuity. It essential to 
prepare for these events and incorporate disaster resilience into long 
term planning through risk management. 

This will enhance internal coordination and continuity planning in 
relation to emergency response, and strengthen multi-stakeholder 
collaboration.

Action 01: 
Create a "Government 
Contingency and Continuity 
Plan" 

As a crucial step towards building municipal resilience, 
we will design and implement a government continuity 
plan that defines roles, recovery times, and critical 
functions within the municipality in the event of a 
major emergency or disaster. Activities will include the 
following: 

The Government Contingency and Continuity Plan 
will be complemented by a Coordination Management 
System that will support collaboration between the 
regional and the local municipality agencies, and 
relevant civil protection services, scientific agencies, 
and other groups (e.g. radio operators, firemen etc.). 

1. Perform a comprehensive review of current 
municipal administration processes in relation to 
disaster risk and response

2. Examine roles, activities and services involved in 
these critical municipal functions, including expected 
recovery times in times of crisis

3. Build scenarios and training activities as part of the 
Government Continuity plan

This will help to monitor and manage fleet rescue 
vehicles and provide alerts to citizens (through e-mails 
or text messages) on emergency situations. It will 
also be used to coordinate voluntary support in areas 
where there is a need.

other Municipalities and stakeholders, the Municipality 
of Thessaloniki will conduct a criticality assessment 
of the road system and a portfolio analysis of the 
vulnerability of its school buildings. 

For the road system, the assessment will identify 
which roads need to remain operational in the event 
of a disaster to allow minimum network connectivity 
and service continuity. 

This information will be coupled with the data from the 
Risk Information System analysis, helping to identify 
and prioritize the elements of the transport network

challenges: 

1. The terrain of the city

2. Inadequate flood defenses and underground 
drainage system

3. A complicated framework of flood prevention

Flood proofing the Metropolitan Areas of Thessaloniki 
is a city-wide priority. Consequently, we will: 

• Regenerate the Regional Drainage ditch and the 
Dendropotamos ditch 

• Evaluate the flood prevention role of the secondary 
ditches in the city and prioritize their flood prevention 
reinforcement

We will develop a platform to empower local citizens 
to better prepare for and respond to emergency 
situations. 

This will include education programs, training, and 
volunteering opportunities, with a special focus on 
involving disabled people and the elderly, who are 
often at the greatest risk in times of crisis. 

We will create volunteering opportunities for local 
citizens to help their neighbors and support their 
community against threats from natural disasters and 
other emergencies. 

We will employ real-time technologies to improve 
communication between City departments and 
communities.

Objective A: 
Integrate economic and 
urban development of the 
Bay

Thermaikos Bay forms an integral part of Thessaloniki's identity. It 
also one of the main reasons for Thessaloniki's commercial, cultural 
and educational success over thousands of years. The Bay comprises 
an extensive ecosystem of economic, environmental, social and 
cultural elements, making it a landmark with unique opportunities 
for sustainable urban development. 

The redevelopment of the New Waterfront has repositioned the role 
of Thermaikos in citizens' everyday life, making it the most popular 
public space in the City, as well as the number one attraction for 
tourists. 

Integrating economic and urban development of Thermaikos will 
ensure that all potential investments and developments will lead to a 
common vision for Thermaikos as a vibrant and thriving ecosystem 
that respects its natural resources and the social diversity of the city 
while offering economic opportunities for the city's entrepreneurs 
and human talent.

Action 01: 
Develop a Land Use Investment 
Framework to capitalize on real 
estate along the coastal zone
Despite being recognized as the most attractive 
natural asset of the city, Thermaikos waterfront has 
not managed to attract significant investment to 
unlock its full revitalization potential. This is partly 
due to complex governance processes as well as the 
absence of an investment framework setting out a 
vision for the development of the area and process 
to achieving it. Recognizing the potential economic 
and social benefits of investing in the revitalization 
of the waterfront and the immediate adjacent 
neighborhoods, the City will initiate a Land Use 
Investment Framework. 

This will help to develop the area into a more 
economically vibrant and sustainable zone for local 
commerce, tourism and leisure activities.

Action 02: 
Develop recreational 
infrastructure

Action 03: 
Develop off-shore 
infrastructure

The topography of the waterfront and its proximity 
to residential and commercial hubs make it the ideal 
location for recreation. 

However, several interventions are required to 
maximize the attractiveness, leisure potential and 
multi-functionality of the waterfront, whilst increasing 
its socio-economic value. 

This action aims at promoting the integration of 
infrastructure on the waterfront, such as open gyms, 
cycling and running tracks, public bathroom facilities, 
floating pools and artificial beaches. 

The development of a coastal inter-municipal bikeway 
will be the most ambitious recreational infrastructure. 
This has been envisioned at a metropolitan scale for 
many years.

Current social and commercial activities along the 
land-sea interface are concentrated on-shore. There is 
still a significant potential to develop off-shore marine 
activities. 

This action plan aims to deliver a set of resilient off-
shore interventions that will add to the aesthetic value 
of the waterfront (e.g. piers). We will also develop 
service-oriented infrastructure such as marinas and 
mooring docks. A seaplane terminal is also envisioned 
and will be developed – subject to development of 
such schemes in other areas across the country.

Thessaloniki is already popular with tourists and locals 
as a marine activity destination, due to its position in 
the Balkan Peninsula and easy access by sea and air. 
Sustainable investment in these activities will pave the 
way for the development of these infrastructure.

Objective B: 
Environmental resilience 
monitoring

Thermaikos Bay has a fragile ecosystem. Currently, environmental 
data and physical measurements are collected by various 
stakeholders at multiple of locations with varying sampling 
frequencies. 

The data is processed in an uncoordinated way. This goal will help 
to coordinate and integrate environmental data to produce valuable 
and meaningful information that can be used to inform decision 
making. Guidelines for monitoring will be set and data analysis will 
identify hot-spots where new frequency and density techniques 
should be established. Multi-stakeholder involvement is essential to 
create synergies, raising awareness and promote better regulation 
implementation. 

Data will be integrated in a GIS environment feeding into modeling 
tools that support decision making on restoration plans. Thermaikos 
is the City's most important natural ecosystem, and there its 
restoration and improvement should be top priorities for all 
stakeholders. No future investments and infrastructure should be 
implemented without having an efficient monitoring system on the 
environmental changes of water ecosystem. 

This will protect the environment and inform integrated decision 
making.

Action 01: 
Develop awareness campaigns 
on the environment of 
Thermaikos

This action will build upon existing successful 
environmental awareness campaigns, with a 
particular focus on the Thermaikos ecosystem. The 
aim is to create a sense of connection to the natural 
environment of Thermaikos, especially since it is 
broadly perceived by citizens as another component 
of the urban environment. 

Campaigns will encourage conservation of this 
sensitive natural resource including its vulnerable 
marine flora and fauna. The campaigns will promote 

sustainable development, particularly in view of the 
envisioned new coastal infrastructure. By enhancing 
environmental consciousness this action supports the 
campaign for a cleaner Bay as a bottom-up approach.

The risk that will have the most detrimental impact, overall, 
will depend on the city’s take on each of the impact 
parameters, e.g. parameters could be expanded in a similar 
sense to other sectors (i.e. social impact, financial impact, 
long term impact/sustainability etc).

Action 02: 
Develop environmental 
monitoring tools

Safeguarding the environment of Thermaikos is a 
top priority. The development of smart monitoring 
systems is crucial to this goal. We will use continuously 
expanding environmental data to understand the main 
sources of contaminations and what their impacts are 
on receptor systems. 

We will develop integrated monitoring tools, from 
data gathering and management to GIS integration 
and modelling. 

This will provide information to help make informed 
decisions about restoring the ecosystem. These tools

Objective C: 
Restoration of the 
ecosystem

An efficient water monitoring system (addressing water quality, 
marine fauna, coastal erosions, etc) provides the opportunity to plan 
projects that improve the overall marine quality and mitigate the 
consequences of prospective infrastructure. 

Examples of such projects include the rehabilitation of natural 
beaches, the upgrade of CSOs of the Water Company, the 
elimination of uncontrolled waste and wastewater point pollution 
sources, reduction of stormwater runoff through Sustainable Urban 
Drainage Systems, and implementation of large scale projects 
beyond the metropolitan scale (e.g.the reduction of nutrient inflow 
from the Axios Delta area).

The restoration projects require cost-benefit analyses and 
prioritization of plans in view of the limited funding. Implementation 
involves different stakeholders from the water company to 
private land owners. A citizen-led approach will help to elevate 
environmental protection as a priority for stakeholders. We will 
establish a set of recurring campaigns designed to increase 
awareness and participation in environmental actions related to 
Thermaikos. 

The improvement of the water ecosystem will have multiple benefits, 
from protection of the natural resources to improved citizen well-
being, increased tourism, and the development of water activities 
and sports.

Action 01: 
Restore the natural beaches 

Marine infrastructure developed along the waterfront 
during the 1960s eliminated most of the natural 
beaches of Thessaloniki. 

This action supports the restoration of the remaining 
beaches as places of significant recreational and 
aesthetic value. Restoration studies will be carried 
out to evaluate cost-benefits and proceed to the 
implementation of restoration measures.

Approach

An Environmental Restoration and 
Improvement Strategy 

A study undertaken by Arup identified a number 
of measures that the city can take to improve the 
environment of the Bay. 

The measures are based on Ease of Implementation (x-axis) 
and Impact (y-axis) criteria. Measures with High Impact 
and Ease of Implementation suggest “Quick Wins” which 
can be prioritized. 

High impact but low ease of implementation measures 
need Efficient Planning, while low impact but high ease of 
implementation measures shall also be Considered.

Action 02: 
Upgrade the Combined Sewer 
Overflows Infrastructure

Action 03: 
Introduce the use of renewable 
energy in the waterfront

Thessaloniki's Water Authority set up its wastewater 
treatment plant in the 1990s. This effectively reversed 
environmental degradation observed until then. 
However, the occasional overflow of the combined 
sewer system now occurs during strong rainfall event, 
posing a risk to the Bay. 

The Water Authority has already put in place a real-
time monitoring system to manage the overflow 
and minimize spillage. It also has plans to upgrade 
the Combined Sewer Overflows to further reduce 
the frequency of events and the total volume of 
wastewater spilled in the Bay.

Partners in action: Water Authority, Municipality of 
Thessaloniki

Timescale: Medium Term

Status: Ongoing

Thermaikos provides a test-case to prove the case for 
a shift to renewables, which can provide affordable, 
reliable and environmentally friendly energy. Fuel 
vehicles have already been prohibited from use on the 
waterfront and the waste collection fleet is based on 
electrical energy. 

A collaborative project between the water authority 
and the municipality will seek to explore the energy 
generation potential from wasterwater collected at 
pumping stations along the waterfront using heat-
exchange technology. 

Opportunities for further green energy generation and 
use will be explored through stakeholder partnerships. 

This action aims at bringing sustainability practices to 
the forefront of the vision for Thermaikos.

Objective D: New 
governance system for the 
management of coastal 
activities on Thermaikos Bay

There are 17 different active stakeholders involved in the 
management of Thermaikos Bay. This includes 7 Municipalities of 
the Metropolitan area of Thessaloniki, the regional authority, various 
departments and agencies of the central government, environmental 
agencies, and the port authority. 

This creates gaps and overlays in maintenance, monitoring, and 
decision-making of the Bay, thus hindering development. A clear, 
step-by-step process will be developed to improve the governance 
of Thermaikos, with emphasis on: 

•  Creating a platform for collaboration between stakeholders

•  Decentralizing authority from the central government to local 

authorities.

Improving the governance model for decision making at Thermaikos 
will lift barriers for further development of the Bay, improve its 
environmental management and create opportunities for more inter-
municipal and multi-stakeholder collaboration.

Action 01: 
Improving the governance of 
the Bay
To improve the governance of the Bay, a clear process 
needs to be set out alongside 4 related actions. 

a. Map relevant players and roles: We will develop a 
stakeholder map covering all those involved in the 
governance of Thermaikos and the management of its 
assets. The EU funded project, MedSeaTies, will form 
the basis for the completion of the survey. The survey 
will include participatory features to understand 
perceptions of each actor on their own involvement 
and role. The survey will identify power overlaps 
and gaps in governance, and the barriers to efficient 
governance and adaptation pathways. 

b. De-centralize authority from Athens to stakeholders 
in Thessaloniki. The EU biodiversity strategy 2020 
calls for coordination at all levels to promote efficient 
governance and management. In Greece, this trend 
has taken place through partial transfer of powers 

to local authorities or new bodies managing specific 
ecosystems, such as the Axios Delta on Thermaikos 
west end. The transfer of centralized powers from 
Athens to Thessaloniki-based bodies would facilitate 
efficient management by eliminating fragmentation 
and raising the issue as a priority.

c. Form consensus on a vision around an MoU with 
a long term goal. Formulating a common vision for 
Thermaikos by the critical stakeholders and actors 
identified in (a) and (b) will put development on a fast 
track. A Communication Platform will transform to an 
Action Alliance once consensus has been built around 
specific economic or environmental issues. 

d. Create a new entity to manage the Bay activities. 
The long term vision for the governance of Thermaikos 
is the creation of a new entity which will have the 
authority to manage or coordinate the Bay activities.

governance structure of Thermaikos. 

This shows the complex nature of the interactions between 
national and local level government bodies involved 
with the management of the Bay as well as major public 
organizations and other stakeholders. 

To avoid siloed governance and ensure effective 
coordination of the waterfront, it is essential to simplify 
this structure.

Objective E: 
Cultural and natural capital 
of the Bay as vehicles 
to social cohesion and 
improved city life

The Axios Delta natural reserve, the cultural activities at Pier A’ 
of the port (including the annual Thessaloniki International Film 
Festival, Museum of Photography, Cinema, Contemporary Art), 
the White Tower, the Opera House are a few of the 80 identified 
historical, cultural and natural landmarks along the Thermaikos 
waterfront. 

Currently, these landmarks span across 7 municipalities, and are 
disconnected due to existing transportation and urban development 
challenges. 

Developing both physical connectivity to and between landmarks 
through a continuous cycle lane and pedestrian accessibilty, but also 
digital connectivity through virtual story maps will help to create 
new business opportunities in the tourism sector. 

This will also contribute to reinforcing Thermaikos's identity, improve 
connectivity between the different municipalities of Thessaloniki and 
raise awareness around the natural environment of the Bay.

Action 01: 
Develop a cultural strategy for 
Thermaikos Bay

Action 02: 
Crowdsourcing ideas and 
promoting community 
participation on the waterfront

The numerous cultural assets in close proximity of 
Thermaikos waterfront are physically disconnected at 
the municipal and metropolitan scales. 

The new waterfront has triggered grassroots initiatives 
and the organization of numerous cultural events 
along the promenade. 

This action aims to create a cultural narrative for 
Thermaikos: the ecosystem itself forms a natural link 
between the disconnected landmarks. 

The action promotes the development of physical 
infrastructure to create this link, but also the

100 Resilient Cities | Thessaloniki Resilience Strategy

Our links to the 
100RC network 

As part of the global network of 100 Resilient 
Cities, Thessaloniki identified common themes and 
challenges with other cities of the network which 
inspired us and helped us in developing the actions in 
this strategy. 

Thessaloniki will continue to be part of this global 
dialogue among the cities, developing synergies and 
peer to peer learning. 

The indicative list below shows the common themes 
emerged during the previous months.

7. Monitoring and

100 Resilient Cities | Thessaloniki Resilience Strategy135

Strategy 
Implementation

Monitoring and 
Evaluation Process

Developing the strategy is the first step on our 
journey towards a more resilient future. The next 
steps are to:

• Continue the resilience dialogue both inside 
the city and with external stakeholders and 
communities through seminars, workshops, and 
open discussions; 

• Secure additional resources (national and 
international) and develop partnerships with the 
100RC Platform partners; 

• Develop a yearly action and investment plan 
along with a Monitoring and Evaluation Report 

To guide and promote the implementation of 
the Resilience Strategy, the city and its partners 
will monitor progress through local and global 
indicators and data sets, outlined in the table 
below.

The challenge that arises from the use of the 
above indicators is the availability of the specific 
data sets in order to have a measurable evaluation.

This is why the Resilience Strategy includes a 
set of Actions that will improve the way data is 
aggregated, managed and shared to facilitate 
the monitoring of the strategy by all relevant 
stakeholders.

Glossary

City values represent our city’s identity and guide 
how we plan for the future.

Goals are longer term statements which address the 
vision statement and illustrate overall impact.

Objectives are mid- and long-term outcomes that the 
city agrees are the most important to fulfilling the 
vision and goals. Objectives have multiple resilience 
benefits and connect different goals and city values.

Actions are the specific project level, including 
tactical activities to help accomplish the objectives. 
Actions can be policies, projects, and initiatives. They 
can be very simple or complex tasks, at the local or 
metropolitan scale. Actions require collaboration 
between different stakeholders and level of 
governance in their implementation, ownership, data 
monitoring and impact evaluation.

Short-term: 1-2 years

Medium term: 3-5 years

Long term: 5-10 years

Aspirational: It requires additional scoping before it 
can be implemented
