Mayor, Surat

Our community’s resilience rests on our people and our ability to live well 
in good times and bounce back stronger than ever from the inevitable 
hard times. Developed with input and insights from the people of Surat, 
the  Resilience  Strategy  is  designed  to  articulate  solutions  that  make 
our  city  more  resilient  not  only  to  physical  challenges,  such  as  floods 
and aging infrastructure, but also to social challenges, such as cohesion 
and  urban  health.  Surat’s  Resilience  Strategy  is  the  launch  point  for 
several programs that foster these connections and partnerships. These 
programs that I am excited about, will enable several community-based 
organizations  to  serve  as  hosts  for  training  and  conduits  to  services 
that are tailored to meet the needs of people. These programs are good 
example of what the practice of resilience looks like—it addresses more 
than one challenge at once and creates multiple benefits for many people.
 
I  am  proud  of  the  many  partnerships  that  have  made  the  Resilience 
Strategy  possible,  and  I  look  forward  to  forming  many  additional 
partnerships  that  will  enable  its  implementation.  100  Resilient  Cities 
(100RC)—pioneered  by  The  Rockefeller  Foundation—has  provided 
invaluable support, guidance, and access to technical assistance. Other 
Indian cities— Chennai, Pune, and Jaipur—are also participating in 100RC, 
and continued collaboration in the region will help to amplify our work 
beyond the boundaries of our respective cities. Most of all, I am grateful 
to the Surat community for contributing to the Resilience Strategy and 
for what you do every day to make Surat the active, dynamic, and highly 
engaged community that it is. I invite all community members to review 
this report with an eye towards how you can join your friends, neighbors, 
and colleagues in making Surat a model of city resilience. 

Best wishes,

Mrs. Asmita Shiroya
Mayor, Surat

MR. MICHAEL BERKOWITZ
President, 100 Resilient Cities

 On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate 
the  city  of  Surat,  Mayor  Asmitaben  Shiroya,  and  Chief  Resilience  Officer 
Kamlesh Yagnik, on the release of the Surat Resilience Strategy, a major 
milestone  for  the  city  and  100RC’s  partnerships  with  it.  A  dynamic  city 
with a rich history, Surat builds on its past as its lays the foundations for a 
resilient future. This document sets forth an extraordinary vision of urban 
resilience for all the residents who call this city home.

Surat’s  resilience  work  builds  on  years  of  close  collaboration  with  the 
Rockefeller  Foundation,  which  began  with  the  Asian  Cities  Climate 
Change Resilience Network. The Resilience Strategy reflects this through 
the  amazing  progress  the  city  has  made  in  understanding  its  resilience 
challenges and embracing the holistic thinking and planning that true re-
silience requires. Through initiatives and actions that strengthen the city as 
a whole, the Strategy enables Surat to addresses its past challenges while 
also recognizing the increasing unpredictability of the future. 

While the Strategy addresses the fissures formed by the city’s rapid growth, 
it  goes  much  further.  Alongside  the  enforcement  of  traffic  rules,  driving 
license  norms,  quality  of  life  assessment,  and  guidelines  on  open  public 
space,  the  Strategy  also  includes  innovative  and  progressive  initiatives 
such as a health and action plan that emphasizes the connection between 
urbanization, climate change and public health, support for women entre-
preneurs, and promotion of civic engagement.  Through this multifaceted 
blueprint  for  the  city’s  present  and  future,  Surat  has  the  opportunity  to 
lead not only in India, but throughout the 100RC network, and the world.

Central to all of these efforts are the people of Surat. The Strategy pro-
vides for creative public outreach to spread awareness of the city’s chal-
lenges and the role of all residents in working to strengthen the city. It also 
dedicates an entire pillar to social cohesion that celebrates the city’s heri-
tage while also embracing the city’s immigrants and their contributions to 
their adopted home. 

This Strategy is a new and exciting chapter of Surat’s resilience work and 
its relationship with 100R. It is also a beginning. It marks the start of excit-
ing work to come in the months and years ahead. Now we can collectively 
begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the following 
pages, which will positively impact the lives of all who call Surat home. We 
at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these 
efforts. 

Best wishes,

Mr. Micheal Berkowitz
President, 100 Resilient Cities

The 100 Resilient Cities (RC) Challenge seeks to work with 100 cities across 
the  globe  to  build  resilience  to  address  social,  economic,  and  physical 
challenges  that  are  faced  by  cities  in  an  increasingly  urbanized  world. 
100RC  facilitates  the  building  of  a  global  practice  of  resilience  among 
governments, NGOs, private sector, and citizens. 

Surat  Resilience  Strategy  provides  a  platform  for  people  from  across 
sectors, institutions and interest groups to come together and help address 
the critical question of what can we do to protect and improve the way of 
life of citizens of Surat in the present and in the future. At the behest of 
SMC various stakeholders worked together to identify issues that impact 
Surat’s resilience. 

I  am  confident  that  Surat  will  become  India’s  champion  for  resilience, 
extending and integrating our already ground-breaking work in fields such 
as climate change adaptation, sustainable service provision, and integrated 
planning, and provide an example for other cities in 100RC to learn from.
 
Best  wishes  to  all  who  are  working  on  this  endeavor.  Surat  Municipal 
Corporation provides wholehearted support to this strategy. 

Regards, 

Mr. N. Thennarasan, IAS 
Municipal Commissioner, 
Surat Municipal Corporation

In  building  resilience,  we  will  reduce  dependency.  Surat  Resilience 
Strategy creates a safer tomorrow for our community. Working together 
will give us the best defense to face the next shock or stress.

Involvement of citizens in leading to transform Surat into Smart & Resilient 
City  is  amazing.  Surat  Strategy  aims  to  integrate  the  smarter  needs  of 
resident  of  Surat  City.  Smart  and  resilient  city  is  about  transformation, 
rejuvenation,  and  future  design.  Smart  and  Resilient  City  is  about  the 
processes to be followed and evolved not a final destination. Our vision is 
of a smart and resilient city that places citizens at the center of its projects 
by continuous involvement of all actors. 

Mr. M. Nagarajan, IAS

The Resilience is in the blood of the Suratis (popularly referred to people of 
Surat).  The Surat Resilience strategy seeks to turn its existing challenges 
into  opportunities.  The  aim  is  to  become  a  champion  city  by  applying 
innovative solutions to problems and responsibly including the thoughts 
and actions of citizens. The city invites all allies to act for, and cooperate 
in, the development of tomorrow’s resilient Surat—a cohesive, robust, and 
sustainable  city.    We  are  very  positive  towards  this  movement  to  thrive 
towards resilient and adaptation to climate change.

Mr Jatin Shah
Advisor, Surat Municipal Corporation
Managing Trustee, Surat Climate Change Trust

Surat  faces  a  diverse  range  of  issues.  Tidal  flooding  and  flash  floods, 
sanitation  and  waste  management,  and  congestion  among  others,  are 
the issues the city currently deals with. Surat city’s government, together 
with  all  of  the  city  elements,  has  worked  to  overcome  these  challenges, 
both through improved physical and non-physical infrastructures.  As for 
the future, I hope that with this City Resilience Strategy Document, Surat, 
along with all its challenges, will become a more resilient city and develop 
into a modern and sustainable city.

STATEMENT OF RESILIENCE CHALLENGE

The daily problems of traffic jams and choked roads in Surat 
affect  connectivity  and  mobility.  This  is  especially  an  issue 
during peak hours when even ambulances and other emergency 
vehicles could get stuck in traffic. Surat also suffers from a lack 
of  enforcement  of  the  traffic  management  system.  Factors 
such as a large number of private vehicles, an inefficient public 
transport system, inadequate parking facilities, unsatisfactory 
footpaths 
for  pedestrians,  encroachments  on  existing 
footpaths and road margins, as well as informal and small-time 
business  activities  on  major  corridors—all  contribute  to  the 
congestion  of  roads  in  the  city.  To  curb  encroachments,  it  is 
necessary  for  the  traffic  police  to  come  up  with  an  effective 
mechanism which would also ease traffic flow in the city. WRI 
through  its  UCRA  engagement  will  be  supporting  Surat  to 
understand  &  potentially  resolve  issues  relating  to  informal 
settlements access to public transit

A wide range of industrial and commercial activities take place 
in  Surat.  People  from  rural  areas  and  other  less-developed 
states flock to the city seeking employment opportunities in 
the industrial, allied, and service sectors; in trade and business 
activities;  and  in  hawking,  retailing,  carting,  and  other  such 
activities. This has resulted in slums and low income settlements 
along the riverside and in low-lying, risk-prone areas. There is 
a huge demand for affordable housing in the city to cater to 
the migrant population. According to a research report by the 
real estate consulting firm, Cushman & Wakefield, Surat tops 
a list of 11 Indian cities that are witnessing a surge in housing 
demand  (TOI,  2016).  PWC  &  WRI  respectively  will  support 
Surat in understanding & finding solution related to affordable 
housing.

The Surat Municipal Corporation manages the water needs of 
the  city.  At  present,  the  main  source  of  water  for  the  entire 
city is the river Tapi. The river’s water quality is deteriorating—
anthropogenic activities and development along the riverside 
contribute to large-scale pollution of the river’s water. In such 
a  situation,  both  water  quality  and  quantity  will  be  a  big 
challenge  for  Surat.  Options  for  finding  alternate  sources  of 
water, such as getting water from Kakrapar weir by pipeline, 
need to be worked out.Also, the city needs to work on various 
water models, for example, the ‘Four National Taps’ model of 
Singapore (PUB, 2016). 1 Potentially Surat will tie with partners 
like Veolia & Deltares to work its water related initiative.

Surat,  known  for  its  polishing,  textile  manufacturing,  and 
diamond cutting industries, is heavily dependent on the latter 
two  dominant  economic  sectors.  Recession  in  these  two 
sectors  has  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  city’s  economy 
(UNDP, 2009). The economy is also characterized by a large 
number of small and medium scale unorganized industries. The 
industrial  base  is  labor-intensive.  The  level  of  unemployment 
is  low;  wages  are  also  low  and  the  workers  are  generally 
deprived of social and other security benefits. The city should 

invite  different  alternative  industries,  such  as  information 
technology,  automobile,  tourism,  etc.,  as  backup  livelihood 
providers in case economic crises occur.

The environment and ecosystem of the city and its surrounding 
areas—critical  determinants  of  the  health  of  its  inhabitants—
impact  work-related  productivity  and  urban  quality  of  life. 
Situated on the banks of the river Tapi, and with its proximity 
to the Arabian Sea, Surat has a sensitive ecosystem. Industrial 
growth,  as  well  as  high  population  growth  and  density,  put 
pressure on this ecosystem. Implementation of environmental 
policies,  such  as  coastal  regulation  and  enforcement  of  laws 
in  industrial  areas,  is  important.  More  green  spaces  need  to 
be  developed  and  maintained.  The  Tapi  is  depleting  due  to 
rapid siltation and development along both sides of the river. 
The  environmental  cell  should  be  more  active  and  efficient 
in  monitoring  air  pollution  and  water  pollution,  as  water 
supply to the city is dependent on the river. CDIA will support 
Surat  in  understanding  &  finding  solution  related  to  coastal 
preservation.

Social  cohesion  and  social  networks  are  weak  in  Surat. 
Communities  are  at  peace  in  the  city,  but  they  are  not 
connected. Stronger efforts from society and the government 
should be made to establish social connectivity and stability. 
Regulations and policing will be crucial for the city to manage 
a  population  that  is  quite  large,  with  much  diversity  existing 
among the communities. To sustain stability, a sense of unity 
and  cultural  values  must  be  embraced  by  the  people  and 
administration. PWC will support Surat in understanding City’s 
Social Cohesion issues.

Surat  has  a  well-developed  health  infrastructure,  including 
government  health  centers  and  private  health  services,  but 
there  is  a  need  for  skilled  and  specialized  human  resources. 
The  upscaling  of  public  health  needs  to  be  achieved  by 
increasing  awareness  and  capacity  building  against  urban 
health  challenges.  Surat  is  infamous  for  vector-  and  water-
borne  diseases.  The  seasonality  of  vector-borne  diseases 
is likely to keep changing, there may be an expansion in the 
disease transmission period due to increased temperatures and 
changes during the humid season. Being an urban ecosystem, 
Surat  is  also  prone  to  increase  other  lifestyle  diseases  and 
pollution  caused  diseases.  Potentially  Save  The  Children  will 
support  Surat  in  understanding  &  finding  solution  related  to 
Public health.

Brief Profile of Surat City

Location

Surat, located in the western part of India in the state of Gujarat, on the banks of the river Tapi, is an important historical trade center 
and serves as a trade link between India and the Gulf countries. Even during the Mughal period, Surat was a gateway to the Deccan 
plateau  and  an  important  port  and  trading  center.  Today,  the  city  has  one  of  the  highest  proposed  investments  and  almost  zero 
percent unemployment. It is one of the fastest growing cities in India. 

Surat is an important commercial city in south Gujarat, and is approximately 250 kilometers (km.) north of Bombay. The city is located 
at 21°10’ N – 72°49’ E, with an altitude of about 13 meters (m.) above mean sea level (AMSL). 

Located at the mouth of the Gulf of Khambhat, Surat experiences a tidal range of about 5 to 6 m. The monthly high tide reaches the 
western parts of the city. Surat district is surrounded by Bharuch, Narmada (North), Navsari, and Dang (South) districts. The Gulf of 
Khambhat is to the west of the city. Surat is a port city; the nearest port now is Hazira, located at the mouth of the Tapi. In the distant 
past, the old city had flood protection systems, including flood walls and gates, which are not present any more. 

Surat has a tropical monsoon climate. Summer temperatures in Surat range from 37 to 44 degree Celsius and winter temperatures 
drop to 22 degree Celsius. Monsoon begins in June and lasts till the end of September, with the average temperature being around 
28 degree Celsius during those months. Average annual rainfall is approximately 1,200 millimeters (mm.) (IMD, 2016). 

Surat, located between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, has a good connectivity in terms of roads and railways, and more recently by air. 
The Golden Quadrilateral—a highway network connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai—passes through Surat. The city is 
connected to NH8 through a 16-km. connector highway.  NH6 and NH228 pass through Surat, connecting various major towns and 
cities of India. The airport at Surat is functional since 2008 and connects Surat with Delhi and Mumbai. 

Like  the  major  business  centers  of  early  historical  times,  which  developed  along  the  banks  of  rivers,  Surat  too  developed  along 
the banks of the Tapi which flows into the Arabian Sea, just 16 km. from the city. The river dictates the topology of the city as the 
landscape slopes gradually from Northeast to Southwest. 

Surat has seen an unprecedented growth in the last four decades, recording one of the highest growth rates in the country and a 10-
fold population rise. It now ranks as the eighth largest city in the country (Census, 2011). Coupled with this, a spillover of population 
into the peripheral areas has also been observed. From time to time, the jurisdictional limits of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) 
have been extended to include the growth.

Surat  faces  risks  of  both  sea  level  rise  and  flooding.  The  Ukai  multipurpose  dam  built  upstream,  94  km.  from  Surat,  was  meant 
for  flood  control  management,  besides  irrigation  and  power  generation.  During  the  last  two  decades,  Surat  and  the  surrounding 
metropolitan region has witnessed major floods.  

The  city  is  prone  to  high  tides, 
flooding,  extreme  heat,  and 
subsequent health risks.

vii

City Growth

Before 1961, Surat comprised an area of 8.12 sq. km.; by 2009 
it had expanded to 326.5 sq. km. The oldest part of the city 
developed between the train station and the parts known as 

Athwalines. Since the 1990s, most new development, including 
the most desirable locations for the city’s burgeoning middle 
and upper class, has taken place in the areas lying between 
Athwalines and the Arabian Sea. 

Growth Pattern of Surat

The Plague of 1994, the city 

authorities undertook one of the 
most massive clean-up operations 
in recent times and revamped the 
entire administration of the city.

Surat 2006-2012

The city has earlier witnessed 
significant floods of varying 

intensity in year of 1968, 1994, 

1998, 2002, and 2006.

1.1 Background

Resilient Cities 

Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, 100 Resilient Cities 
(100RC) helps cities around the world become more resilient 
to  the  physical,  social,  and  economic  challenges  that  are  a 
growing part of the 21st century. 100RC views resilience not just 
as shocks—earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.—but also as stresses 
that  weaken  the  fabric  of  a  city  on  a  day-to-day  or  cyclical 
basis. Examples of these stresses include high unemployment, 
an  overtaxed  or  inefficient  public  transportation  system, 
endemic  violence,  or  chronic  food  and  water  shortages.  By 
addressing both the shocks and the stresses together, a city 
is better equipped to respond to adverse events and is overall 
better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and 
bad to all populations. 

Resilience Strategy

A  resilience  strategy  helps  cities  prepare  for,  adapt  to,  and 
quickly  rebound  from,  shocks  and  stresses.  The  objective  of 
the  resilience  strategy  is  to  provide  a  roadmap  for  the  Chief 
Resilience Officer (CRO) to build resilience in the city. 

The  resilience  strategy  serves  as  a  tactical  roadmap  to  build 
resilience  in  the  city.  It  articulates  the  city’s  priorities  for 
building  resilience  through  specific  initiatives  for  immediate 
implementation as well as the city’s longer continued path. The 
resilience  strategy  triggers  action,  investment,  and  support 
within city government and from outside groups. Rather than 
a static roadmap, the resilience strategy is a living document 
to be continuously fine-tuned as priorities are addressed and 
initiatives get implemented. 

ACUTE SHOCKS

Acute  shocks  include  hurricanes, 
flooding,

1.2 100RC Network Collaborations 

The Rotterdam 100RC Water Exchange held in October 2015 
focused on the complex intersection of climate change, aging 
infrastructure,  flood  management,  urban  development,  and 
social  connectivity  combined  with  the  diverse  perspectives 
brought by participating CROs from nine cities. This offered 
a rich learning experience for Surat. 

The urban infrastructure of Asian cities faces social, political, 
environmental,  and  financial  risks  due  to  climate  change 
induced  shocks  and  stresses.  This  creates  the  impetus  for 
city stakeholders to assess their cities’ vulnerabilities and to 
look for investment opportunities in designing and building 
resilient  urban  infrastructure.  Training  on  Urban  Climate 
Change  Adaptation  and  Resilience  is  aimed  at  improving 
climate  change  and  urban  resilience  knowledge  among 
the  SMC’s  senior  level  managers  and  to  help  them  design 
projects. This training in Singapore was organized by Cities 
Development Initiatives of Asia in May 2016, under its Cities 
and Climate Change Training Series.

Over five days in Mexico City in November 2015, Surat had a 
chance to collaborate with other cities and, by shaping and 
sharing its own learning, came to a better understanding of 
resilience. Surat learnt about real-world resilience challenges 
and  solutions  by  visiting  ‘Living  Laboratories’.  It  catalyzed 
enthusiasm and commitment among CROs.

International  Symposium 

The  Second 
for  Resilient 
Communities in Koriyama, Japan, was co-organized in April 
2016  by  the  Institute  for  Resilient  Communities  and  the 
Fukushima  Renewable  Energy  Institute.  It  brought  together 
scientists,  engineers,  public  health  experts,  educators, 
policy makers, and others to collaborate on building resilient 
communities.  Surat  educated  itself  about  interdisciplinary 
research programs to address critical issues in resilience, and 
learned how to engage with various public activities to foster 
interactions between experts and communities.

The July 2016 Singapore Regional Summit was designed to 
achieve objectives built on the experience of earlier summits 
and  best  practices.  It  built  and  strengthened  relationships 
among  CROs,  Resilience  Team  Members,  and  partners  to 
better  leverage  the  network  of  practitioners.  It  increased 
the City Resilience Team’s capacity to work around problem 
definitions  and  city  actions.  It  fostered  a  regional  cohort 
by  bringing  to  the  fore  regional  priorities  to  help  advance 
collective action.

The  Smart  Cities  Innovative  Summit  Asia  Conference  in 
South  Korea  was  organized  in  September  2016.  It  provided 
the  Surat  CRO  an  opportunity  to  discuss  Smart  City  plans 
with  many  Smart  City  Leaders  of  other  Asian  countries. 
The  ‘leadership  of  management’  and  ‘policy  issues  for  4th 
revolution  and  ICT  business’  were  also  deliberated  along 
with the Smart City initiation agenda of budgeting, funding, 
challenges, management, and cooperation.

2.1 Stakeholder Engagement

The  strategy  development  process  was  started  by 
identifying and engaging with relevant stakeholders and city 
champions under the aegis of the city administration. Seven 
discovery groups were formed, comprising decision makers, 
planners,  municipal  engineers,  academicians,  researchers, 
entrepreneurs/businessmen,  builders’  associations,  water 
resource managers, public health practitioners, and energy/
gas suppliers. 

Surat is considered a model city for good governance as well 
as for providing effective service delivery in comparison with 
many  other  Indian  cities.  Surat  also  has  the  advantages  of 
efficient city administration, strong political consensus, and 
sufficient municipal finances. 

In  the  past,  the  city  has  demonstrated  its  capacity  to  build 
resilience by improving the quality of its lifeline services such 
as disaster management, water supply, sewerage, solid waste 
disposal, and health. The mission of the city is to strengthen 
its infrastructure, withstand future shocks and stresses, build 
redundancies, and improve resilience. The SMC has improved 
its capacity to deal with shocks and stresses, and has taken 
up  proactive  initiatives  in  urban  development,  community 
health,  and  disaster  management,  working  closely  with 
industry  and  citizens.  Inputs  from  multistakeholder  groups 
led  by  the  SMC  can  not  only  address  various  issues  at  city 
level  but  also  influence  policy  at  state  and  central  levels. 
Therefore,  any  progress  in  this  city  will  be  keenly  observed 
and can act as an example for urban resilience in other Indian 
cities, including the 100RC cities.

Innovative  methods  and  tools  were  used  in  the  strategy 
development  process.  Some  of  the  key  highlights  of  the 
process are: 

   Consultations  with  policy  makers  and  decision  makers  at 

the city/municipal administration. 

   Shared 

learning  dialogues  (SLDs)  with  enforcement 
authorities,  such  as  city/district  police  administration  and 
Surat range police administration. 

   Key informant interviews (KIIs) with state-level government 

departments and institutions. 

   Meetings  with  elected  members  of  city-,  state-,  and 

national-level political systems. 

   Focus  group  discussions  (FGDs)  with  city  steering 

committee members and discovery group members. 

   Consultations with subject matter specialists. 
   Conduct  of  time-bound  research  studies  to  understand 
different  aspects  of  the  current  situation  and  obtain 
information from secondary literature and primary surveys. 
   Engagement with a new generation of planners/engineers/
researchers  via  the  Urban  Transport  and  Infrastructure 
Design (UTID) Studio (with transport planning students). 

   Participation in community engagement events to capture 

the perceptions of citizens. 

The supporting images show an array of activities, including 
academic activities, community level activities and academic 
engagements as part of 100RC Surat, experts’ participatory 
exercises

Transdisciplinary  research  on  resilience  issues  in  complex 
urban  systems  will  generate  knowledge  in  relation  to  the 
seven pillars. Research is a continuous process and will require 
constant  engagement  with  institutions  and  stakeholders.
Awareness  plays  a  significant  role  in  achieving  the  aim  of 
resilience  strategy.  Some  amount  of  awareness  has  already 
been  created  by  engaging  stakeholders  on  the  key  shocks 
and  stresses.  Enforcement  also  plays  a  very  important  role 
in  implementing  rules  and  regulations  especially  in  traffic 
and  pollution  management  which  is  now  taken  care  by 
various  agencies.  Agencies  uses  advanced  technology  for 
law  enforcement  such  as  surveillance  cameras  to  monitor 
traffic at various locations across the city.Some of the long 
term  initiatives  are  aligned  towards  physical  infrastructure 
development  which  needs  implementation  support  from 
urban local body.

Resilience Synergy

Synergy  was  established  between  national-  and  state-level 
policies, and programs; projects and institutions were linked to 
incorporate the lessons.Efforts were made to ensure that the 
resilience goals and initiatives identified aligned with various 
national-  and  state-level  policies,  programs,  and  projects.
The current resilience strategy includes plans to inform and 
influence  national-  and  state-level  stakeholders  by  sharing 
lessons learned from city resilience interventions. There is a

The  resilience  strategy  adopts  a  multiscalar  approach  to 
address  various  resilience  issues.  The  interventions  aim  to 
improve multistakeholder participation, and empower citizens 
to  take  informed  decisions  post  strategy  development.  It  is 
necessary to test these concepts through small pilot projects 
and  research  studies  to  ensure  their  effectiveness  while 
replicating them across the city. These concepts can be built 
on  the  existing  mechanisms  and  help  in  providing  timely 
information.

Resilience Timeline

Resilience goals and initiatives introduced through the Surat 
resilience strategy are categorized based on the time required 
for successful implementation. Short-term interventions are 
initiatives which may span from one to two years (2016–2018) 
and medium-term interventions are initiatives which may span 
from one to five years (2016–2020). Long-term initiatives may 
require  longer  time  (2016–2025),  more  resources  (financial 
and  human),  and  may  require  considerable  political  and 
administrative will for execution.

Resilience Incubation

During the strategy development process, various institutions 
and  organizations  were  identified  as  resilience  incubators. 
These 
institutions  will  be  custodians  of  knowledge, 
technology,  and  experience.  Data/information  collected 
during various phases of the resilience-building exercise can 
be  stored  in  these  institutions  to  ensure  access  over  time, 
leading  to  continued  sustainability  of  the  efforts.  These 
institutions  and  organizations  were  brought  on-board  from 
the begining.  

Bouquet of Initiatives

Resilience is a multisectoral process. It requires cross-sector 
links to develop a robust strategy with implementable actions. 
Surat’s resilience strategy is aimed at generating multi- and 
cross-sectoral  information  which  can  broaden  the  scope 
of  planning  and  designing  initiatives.  The  development  of 
Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) can be the next logical step 
for  the  city  government  to  access  financial  resources  apart 
from  the  state  or  national  government.  To  facilitate  that 
process,  several  studies  and  research  for  informing  DPRs 
have been identified and highlighted.

Figure 2.2: Characteristics of Surat Resilient Initiatives

Characteristics

Initiatives are capable of addressing future needs, handling sudden/
foresighted shocks and stresses of Surat, and serving multiple sectors 
(drivers).

Opportunities have been passed through a rigorous process of 
selection and prioritization, which is well reflected in how the goals 
address the major shocks and stresses of the city.

For each of the discovery areas, more than 10 different initiatives 
were identified to address city-specific needs. Care was taken to have 
the identified initiatives implemented by a range of stakeholders to 
maximize reach and replicability of the strategy.

Surat resilient strategy contains research, awareness, and enforcement 
level opportunities which can be modified according to future needs.

Projects related to engineering and infrastructure development are 
already supported by the city. Resilience initiatives and opportunities 
are therefore aligned to state- or national-level programs.

The strategy reflects multistakeholder engagement in the initiative 
description as initiative owners and supporters. Every initiative 
identified within this strategy has a supporting brief which indicates 
the scale of stakeholder involvement needed. This includes a range of 
actors from academia, business/private sector, government, and civil 
society

Resilient initiatives are well aligned to the different levels of 
administrative policies applicable in Surat. The initiatives are also 
linked to plans, programs, and projects—for instance, Smart City, Atal 
Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), etc.—
supported by national and state governments.

3.1 Resilience Pillars, Goals, and Initiatives

The Surat resilience strategy has been developed around seven strategic pillars, 20 goals, and 63 initiatives/actions. This section 
includes the initiatives that Surat will further develop and implement between 2016 and 2025. Each pillar is defined by a number of 
goals and associated initiatives. Figure 3.1 shows the resilience pillars and their orientation; Figure 3.2 shows the resilience pillars, 
goals, and initiatives in Surat’s strategy.

3.2  Strategy  Linkages 
Initiative Linkages
 
The  Surat  resilience  strategy  identifies  seven  pillars 
(discovery  areas),  20  goals,  and  63  initiatives—the 
lattermost will create a resilient impact on all the pillars, 
thus increasing their resilient value.

Eleven initiatives were identified around Connectivity and 
Mobility.  These  initiatives  were  more  targeted  towards 
shared mobility, public transport, nonmotorized transport 
(NMT)  solutions  for  traffic  hotspots,  traffic  awareness 
and  education.  During  expert  group  discussions,  these 
initiatives  were  prioritized  by  committee  members  and 
subject experts. Later, these initiatives were investigated 
with other pillars to check the interdependencies between 
resilience  issues,  using  various  impact  scenarios.  The 
results  indicate  that  connectivity  and  mobility  centric 
initiatives  have  higher 
interdependencies 
with  other  initiatives  in  the  areas  of  Environment  and 
Ecosystem, Public Health, and Social Cohesion. As public 
transport  forms  the  backbone  of  any  efficient  urban 
mobility  system,  adequate  public  transportation  will 
contribute  to  the  other  ongoing  environment  friendly 
and safety initiatives. Currently the city administration is 
increasing the number of public buses and also planning 
to develop new and alternate modes including BRTS and 
Metro Rail system.

levels  of 

Seven  initiatives  were  identified  around  Affordable 
Housing.  These  were  focused  on  housing  demand 
and  supply  assessment,  availability  of  financial  aids  for 
affordable housing, identification of affordable localities 
in the city and neighborhoods, and green infrastructure. 
The  results  indicate  that  the  initiatives  of  affordable 
housing  have  higher 
interdependencies 
with  other  initiatives  in  the  areas  of  Employment  and 
Economic Dependency and Social Cohesion. In the case 
of  affordable  housing  in  Surat,  key  industrial  nodes  can 
serve  as  workplace  hubs,  where  similar  income  groups 
can live together in a cohesive social environment.

levels  of 

Thirteen  initiatives  were  identified  to  address  Water 
Availability  and  Quality.  These  were  focused  towards 
innovative infrastructure for better management of water 
supply,  aiming  for  zero  water  waste,  and  conservation 
of  rainwater  and  groundwater  resources.  The  identified 
initiatives  of  the  water  sector  have  higher  levels  of 
interdependency with initiatives in the area of Ecosystem 
and  Environment  and  Employment  and  Economic 
Dependency pillars. The textile industry also contributes 
much to the city’s economy and employment. Solutions 

17

to  these  key  environmental  issues,  therefore,  will  ensure 
that the city and its economy grow in an environmentally 
sustainable manner.

Five  initiatives  were  identified  under  Employment  and 
Economic  Dependency.  These  are  targeted  towards 
developing alternative employment opportunities in new 
and  emerging  sectors  such  as  information  technology, 
shipping  and  technical  skill  development  programs  in 
addition  to  financial  aid  to  encourage  entrepreneurship. 
The  majority  of  textile  industries  rely  heavily  on  local 
roads and regional transport networks (rail and road) to 
procure raw materials and to export processed products.

Fourteen  initiatives  were  identified  around  Environment 
and  Ecosystem.  These  initiatives  are  more  focused  on 
environmental regulations and policies, new infrastructure 
interventions 
conservation, 
energy  efficiency,  and  community-level  awareness  for 
environmental  conservation.  These  initiatives  will  have 
positive  impacts  on  Water  Availability  and  Quality, 
Economy,  Public  Health,  and  Affordable  Housing. 
Discussions with expert committee members highlighted 
the  fact  that  the  initiatives  this  pillar  have  a  higher  level 
of interdependencies with initiatives of Water Availability 
and Quality, Public Health, and Employment and Economic 
Dependency. Therefore, the indicators of water and health 
require continuous monitoring in the city due to the geo-
climatic  location  and  due  to  historical  flood  and  plague 
events.

inclined 

Ten  initiatives  were  identified  around  Social  Cohesion. 
These  are 
towards  encouraging  public 
participation  at  the  community  level  and  cooperation 
with  the  government  by  developing  community-level 
activities.  Such  programs  and  community  spaces  will 
help  create  a  better,  livable  environment  and  encourage 
cultural conservation which will, in turn, enhance the local 
identity of the city. The results indicate that the initiatives 
of  Environment  and  Ecosystem  have  higher  levels  of 
interdependency  with  the  pillars  of  Connectivity  and 
Mobility, Environment and Ecosystem, and Public Health. 

Three  initiatives  were  identified  under  Public  Health. 
These  are  focused  towards  skill  development,  which  will 
increase  the  availability  of  general  health  care  facilities 
and make it affordable. The initiatives under this pillar are 
also inclined towards urban climate–health challenges to 
create a healthy, livable urban ecosystem in Surat. The city 
needs more affordable and general health care, especially 
during disaster-like situations.

BACKGROUND

RESILIENCE CHALLENGES

Surat is one of the fastest growing cities in India. In the last 
few  years,  with  changing  lifestyles,  the  number  of  vehicles 
has  grown  tremendously  in  the  city.  As  per  recent  reports, 
the number of registered vehicles in the city is more than 2.6 
million, and this includes all categories of vehicles (TOI, 2016). 
A  drastic  shift 
is  evident:  people  are  moving  from 
nonmotorized to motorized transport and from two-wheelers 
to  four-wheelers.  Comprising  more  than  70  percent  of  the 
total  number,  two-wheelers  take  the  maximum  share,  while 
cars constitute more than 9 percent of the vehicles. In 2015, 
the city had 2.18 million vehicles plying on the roads, of which 
1.7  million  were  two-wheelers  and  0.26  million  cars.  This 
means  that  for  every  two  residents  in  the  city,  there  is  one 
vehicle (TOI, 2016). 

Coupled with high growth of private vehicles, an inefficient 
public  transport  system,  inadequate  parking  facilities,  and 
lack of pedestrian facilities, encroachments on footpaths and 
road  margins,  informal  activities,  and  small-time  business 
activities  along  the  major  corridors  have  increased  traffic 
congestion in the city. 

Absence  of  public  transport  for  over  a  decade  has  led  to 
para-transits, especially auto-rickshaws, emerging as a major 
public transport provider, as well as an increase in individual 
modes  of  transport.  Para-transits,  apart  from  being  illegal, 
add to problems such as unorganized operations, overloading, 
poor services, pollution, overcharging, and restricted service 
hours. 

Even  though  there  is  an  increase  in  the  number  of  private 
vehicles in the city, there is not much improvement in traffic 
behavior.  A  lack  of  traffic  sense  and  awareness  leads  to 
issues of traffic management. The people of Surat have a bad 
reputation for being rash and careless drivers. An increase in 
the number of nonlicensed drivers has also been observed in 
the city. 

To build resilience, the city needs to implement an efficient 
traffic  management  system  and  move  towards  ensuring  an 
adequate  public  transport  system.  Several  research  studies 
are necessary to identify the scale of interventions required. 
These  include  increasing  public  parking  and  pedestrian 
facilities, 
junctions  and  rail  crossings,  and 
provisioning traffic signals and lane separators to segregate 
traffic.  An  effective  enforcement  mechanism  by  the  traffic 
police is also necessary to enforce smooth traffic flow in the 
city.

improving 

Traffic congestion in Surat

Public  Transport:  Public  transport  is  one  of  the  concerns 
highlighted  by  a  majority  of  the  stakeholders.  There  is  less 
public transport than what is needed, the service frequency 
is low, and it covers limited areas only. Further, a majority of 
the population find it difficult to use it due to limited signage 
and poor comfort levels. 

Illegal  Parking:  Surat  has  commercial  areas  and  markets 
situated  in  the  center  of  the  city.  Access  to  these  places  is 
through  narrow  lanes,  and  there  are  no  authorized  parking 
facilities.  Even  major  roads  with  high  attraction  points  lack 
parking facilities. This leads to people parking their vehicles 
under  bridges,  footpaths,  and  on  the  sides  of  main  roads, 
leading to reduced space for vehicular traffic and increased 
traffic congestions.

Footpath  Encroachment:  Encroached  pedestrian  lanes  on 
both sides of the roads decrease free movement of pedestrians 
and compromises on safety. Lanes and footpaths are usually 
occupied  illegally  by  vendors  or  vehicles  parked  along  the 
roadside.  Currently,  only  limited  residential  and  commercial 
areas have clearly demarcated pedestrian lanes or footpaths. 
Footpaths in some of the newly developed areas, like Gaurav 
Path (in Piplod) and University Road (in Vesu), are occupied 
by mobile food joints, which attract citizens for recreational 
activities.

High Number of Rickshaws & Private Vehicles: Lack of public 
transport has led to increased numbers of private transport 
providers and private vehicles.

Airport Connectivity: The city has one domestic airport. The 
current frequency of flights is limited and caters to only two 
destinations—Delhi  and  Mumbai.  Such  limited  connectivity 
has an adverse impact on trade and mobility.

Industrial  Logistics:  Industrial  units  located  within  the 
city  operate  in  a  congested  environment.  Lack  of  proper 
roads  and  reduced  carriage  width  due  to  roadside  parking 
contribute  to  existing  traffic  problems.  There  is  a  need  to 
develop a detailed logistics plan for these industries.

BRIEF

Accessibility to public transport is the key challenge within the 
city. The city needs to assess accessibility to its public transport 
facilities and highlight the areas which need improvement. To 
achieve  this,  a  detailed  Public  Transport  Accessibility  Levels 
(PTAL)—which takes into consideration average walking speed 
and time, distances to public transport stops, and peak-hour 
route  frequencies  of  different  modes  of  public  transport—is 
needed. Geographic Information System (GIS) based mapping 
tools  can  be  used  to  generate  a  visual  representation  for 
strategic future transport planning.

BRIEF

The city will conduct a detailed road accident study, which will 
be aimed at identifying existing hotspots for accidents. It will 
also  highlight  areas  where  road  safety  issues  are  persistent 
issues.  The  research  study  will  use  images  from  more  than

OBJECTIVE

To  raise  awareness  about  road  safety,  traffic 
rules and regulation and use of public/shared 
transport.

BRIEF

A  detailed  annual  plan  for  awareness  generation  will  be 
prepared  for  2017.  This  will  include  activities  such  as  street 
plays  (U-Turn  events),  public  meetings  at  various  schools, 
colleges, and public spaces. Awareness will also be generated

BACKGROUND

The city of Surat has rapidly grown since the 1960s in terms 
of population as well as industry, thus placing a concomitant 
pressure on resources. The city has also expanded over time 
(major  expansion  happened  in  2006);  it  currently  covers 
an area of around 326 sq. km. The population of the city in 
2011 was 4,466,826 (Census of India). The actual population 
may  exceed  these  figures,  especially  because  of  rapid 
development in the Surat metropolitan region.

The  decadal  growth  of  the  city’s  population  was  at  its 
maximum from 1931 to 1941. For two decades following this 
period,  the  city  showed  a  decrease  in  the  decadal  growth. 
From 1961, a positive trend continued till 1991 before declining 
again  from  1991  to  2001.  Surat  has  seen  an  unprecedented 
growth in the last four decades, recording one of the highest 
growth  rates  in  the  country  and  a  10-fold  population  rise. 
The city now ranks as the eighth largest city in the country. 
Coupled with this, a spillover of population into the periphery 
has also been observed.

Similar  to  other  urban  cities  in  India,  Surat  has  its  own 
share  of  slums.  The  slums  have  mostly  migrant  populations 
who  are  unable  to  afford  formal  housing.  As  per  the  2001 
Census, about 307 slums, with a population of 0.49 million, 
existed  in  Surat.  The  number  of  slums  has  since  gone  up 
to  773  (Census  of  India,  2011)  with  the  expansion  in  the 
city’s  limit  in  2006.  Many  of  these  slums  are  located  along 
the  tidal  creeks,  between  river  embankments  and  other 
drainage  lines.  These  slums  face  a  higher  risk  of  flooding 
(pluvial, fluvial, and tidal). Having recognized this, efforts to 
relocate  the  slums  were  initiated  by  the  government  under 
various  schemes—mainly  during  the  last  decade  under 
various  national  projects  including  the  Jawarharlal  Nehru 
National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  and  Gujarat 
Rural Urban Housing (GRUH)—more than 30,000 permanent 
houses  were  provided  at  safer  locations  to  slum  dwellers. 
In  2001,  according  to  Census  figures,  20  percent  of  Surat’s 
population  lived  in  slums.  Census  2011  showed  a  reduction 
of  10  percent  due  to  continuous  improvement  efforts  by 
government  schemes.  Slum  dwellers  and  citizens  falling 
in  the  economically  weaker  sections  (EWS)  of  society  are 
eligible to avail ready-built houses on plots of land away from 
the existing slums, in a hygienic environment. 

With  an  increase  in  the  city  limit  and  development  of  new 
zones, a boom has been observed in the real estate market. 
This has increased the land values in some areas, making it 
unaffordable for all classes. This has caused a gap between 
demand  and  supply,  leaving  about  90  percent  of  houses  in 
the newly developed areas unoccupied.

Built  House  Approach:  The  SMC  has  implemented  several 
housing  projects  under  the  government’s  housing  schemes 
for urban poor. Also, slum dwellers living at the intersection 
of roads and other inappropriate locations have been shifted 
to  the  houses  built  under  the  housing  schemes.  The  built 
house  approach  for  the  rehabilitation  of  slum  dwellers  and 
urban poor is carried out under the following five categories: 
 
   EWS Housing
   VAMBAY Hosuing
   LIG Housing
   Mukhya Mantri Gruh Yojana
   Pradhan Mantri Avas Yojna

RESILIENCE CHALLENGES

Less Rental Housing: Rental housing can be a logical solution 
for meeting affordable housing needs of a city that has a large 
migrant population. Rental housing should be promoted as a 
temporary solution for housing, since vacant housing is not 
affordable. 

Lack  of  Involvement  of  Private  Sector  for  Affordable 
Housing: There are no formal policies to involve the private 
sector  for  affordable  housing.  As  an  ULB,  the  SMC  has  the 
freedom to adopt a model in which the city can benefit from 
its strong private sector, especially for affordable housing.

Affordable Criteria for EWS, and for LIG, MIG, and HIG (Low-
,  Middle-,  and  High-Income  Groups:  Affordable  housing 
can  be  delivered  by  taking  into  consideration  criteria  such 
as  cost-effective  materials,  optimum  use  of  carpet  area, 
and  affordable  land  availability  for  the  housing  schemes. 
Affordable  housing  can  be  achieved  by  providing  certain 
subsidies or tax deduction on material or land.

Disparity  in  Demand  and  Current  SUDA  plan:  As  a  part 
of  discovery  area  diagnosis,  the  SUDA’s  plan  needs  to  be 
reviewed  to  see  how  it  provides  for  the  affordable  housing 
sector.  Surat  has  growth  in  population  and  the  area  of  the 
city  has  also  grown  simultaneously.  The  study  can  show 
projections  for  demand  keeping  in  view  criteria  such 
as  population  growth,  city  expansion,  affordability,  and 
economic growth as well.

Spatial  Distribution:  Spatial  distribution  of  LIG/MIG/HIG 
needs  to  be  ensured,  based  on  the  affordability  of  the 
amenities/utilities. For example, the Vesu area has a certain 
lifestyle and cost of living which is suitable for HIG housing. 
Planning  LIG  or  MIG  in  this  area  will  not  serve  the  idea  of 
affordability,  resulting  in  vacant  housing  and  unserved 
need  of  housing  facilities.  Housing  for  all  requires  the  right 
distribution, based on affordability of a locality for consumers 
in terms of day-to-day utilities.

Affordable locality audit
To identify affordable localities in Surat where 
amenities  and  public  utilities/services,  such 
as  public  transport,  affordable  health  care, 
affordable education, food, etc., are available 
at low costs.

BRIEF

Overall  living  cost  of  a  location  is  very  important  for  lower 
income  group  and  middle-income  group  households.  Along 
with an affordable housing unit, it is very important to know/
understand  the  other  parameters  of  affordability,  such  as 
affordable transport, fuel/gas, health care, education, livelihood 
options. The city will conduct affordable locality audits under 
this  initiative.  The  suitability  criteria  will  be  based  on  the 
accessibility of infrastructure and amenities within the location, 
that is, LIG and MIG closer to the public transport network, fair 
price shops, and further low-cost lifestyle amenities.

BACKGROUND

Water needs of the city residents are currently being managed 
by the SMC. Tapi, a perennial river, is a major source of water 
supply. The network of piped water supply was started in 1898. 
The city has been investing in water supply systems for over 
a century, on account of which it has a well-managed water 
supply  system  now.  In  2015,  the  average  water  supply  was 
980 million liters per day (MLD), which included demand from 
domestic, industrial, commercial, and institutional consumers. 

In the recent past, it has been observed that the river water 
quality is deteriorating. Causes contributing to the pollution 
of  the  river  water  are  sometimes  beyond  the  control  of  the 
SMC,  as  they  are  outside  the  city  boundary.  Hence,  options 
for finding alternate sources of water—such as getting water 
from Kakrapar weir by pipeline—are being worked out. In such 
an eventuality, both quality and quantity issues will be a big 
challenge  for  Surat.  Currently,  water  supply  is  intermittent, 
with  an  average  duration  of  three  hours  per  day.  About  95 
percent of the complaints related to water supply are being 
solved by the SMC. 

To  meet  the  rising  population  demands  of  water  over  the 
next  two  decades,  the  SMC  has  envisaged  various  water 
supply  infrastructure  projects.  Water  supply  schemes  were 
supported  by  the  national  and  state  governments  between 
2010  and  2015.  During  this  period,  various  water  supply 
projects  were  sanctioned  under  the  JNNURM  scheme  for 
the newly-merged Eastern area of the city. In January 2013, 
a  90-MLD  capacity  fully-automatic  water  treatment  plant 
with  Supervisory  Control  and  Data  Acquisition  (SCADA) 
was commissioned at Kosad Water Works. In 2014–15, a pilot 
project of 24x7 water supply scheme for the New North area 
and  New  Southeast  area  were  commissioned  with  a  total 
project cost of Rs. 34.54 crore. 

By  fast-tracking  the  implementation  of  projects,  the  SMC 
has achieved 30 percent increase in water supply, from 750 
MLD in 2010 to 980 MLD in 2015. The SMC is now poised to 
achieve  the  goal  of  100  percent  coverage  of  extended  area 
and population by 2016. 

Currently,  river  Tapi  is  the  main  source  of  water  supply  in 
Surat.  Droughts  and  late  onset  of  monsoon  are  already 
creating  stress  on  Surat’s  water  supply  system  during  peak 
summers. For meeting the demand of a population pegged at 
more than 8 million in 2020, at least 1,200 to 1,500 MLD water 
is required. Apart from domestic use, additional water will be 
needed for industries in Hazira. 

With  tremendous  increase  in  the  population  within  city 
limits,  there  is  likely  to  be  an  obvious  increase  in  the  water 
demand. The city has the capacity to store for approximately 
three months only, in case of any drought or natural calamity, 
which highlights the need for reuse of water in the city. Lack 
of  water  conservation  practices  may  lead  to  a  crisis  in  the 
near future in the absence of the present water source, Tapi. 
Taking  the  effects  of  climate  changes  into  account,  good 

water conservation methods need to be planned. The city is 
reusing  a  negligible  amount  of  water,  about  only  8  percent. 
Salt water intrusion is another big problem for the city due to 
its proximity to the Arabian Sea. This situation may increase 
the competition over limited resources currently allocated for 
irrigation and power generation. Water scarcity will become 
an issue, unless major changes in allocating Ukai dam water 
takes place.
 
RESILIENCE CHALLENGES

Water Quality: Being close to the Arabian Sea, and more than 
40  percent  of  the  city  lying  in  low  elevation  coastal  zones, 
tidal action and subsequent salt water intrusion is one of the 
key challenges the city faces.

Water Conservation: While the existing water quality is good 
in Surat due to water availability from Ukai dam, the citizens 
do  not  follow  proper  water  conservation  and  management 
approaches.  River  and  groundwater  pollution  needs  to  be 
monitored in the city. There is a need for regulations such as 
incorporation  of  rainwater  harvesting  as  a  part  of  building 
bylaws  and  also  for  raising  awareness  among  citizens  on 
conservation and limiting wastage of water.

Tertiary Treatment Plan - Surat: Treatment methods vary for 
different  types  of  wastewater.  For  example,  different  sets 
of  microbes  will  be  required  for  treating  different  wastes. 
However, in Surat, this is not done currently. The city is reusing 
only 8 percent of waste water for industrial purposes. 

Demand  Assessment:  Conflicting  demand  from  various 
sectors  such  as  resideConflicting  demand  from  various 
sectors  such  as  residential,  industrial,  irrigation,  natural/
ecological  cycles  require  assessment.  Domestic  water 
demand  is  something  which  will  unquestionably  increase  in 
the  future  as  the  population  increases.  Town  planning  and 
engineering techniques are very important in this sector since 
they  also  play  a  crucial  role  in  groundwater  availability  and 
recharge  over  long  term.  Keeping  soil  moisture  and  water 
table  in  mind,  design  aspects  should  be  adapted  in  such  a 
way that the water table gets recharged.

Increasing  Pollution  and  River  Tapi  Depletion:  Primarily 
untreated  sewage  from  upstream  settlements  along  with 
industrial effluents has led to high water pollution. Industrial 
pollution does not have major impact on Tapi river but it has 
impact on various creeks leading to Mindhola river. Surat, also 
called  mini  India,  celebrates  many  different  festivals  which 
also  cause  river  pollution  and  increase  biological  oxygen 
demand (BOD) levels in the river. Issues of water siltation and 
untreated  effluents  are  likely  to  impact  the  quality  of  river 
water. In addition, groundwater pollution has been recorded in 
many areas of the city. Thus there is a need for environmental 
management of the river and the results should be shared with 
the  public  to  initiate  collective  actions.  The  city  encounters 
many water-borne diseases which need to be checked.

BRIEF

BRIEF

According  to  the  Gujarat  Development  Control  Regulation, 
it  is  mandatory  for  high  rise  buildings  to  install  rainwater 
harvesting units at the time of construction. Initially the city will 
start rainwater harvesting within government and institutional 
buildings  and  promote  it  as  a  best  practice.  If  implemented, 
this  will  reduce  the  water  supply  demand,  especially  in  the 
institutional  areas,  and  lead  to  conservation  of  natural  water 
resources. As a secondary benefit, such enforcement will also 
help  save  energy  used  for  water  supply.  As  a  second  entry 
point,  an  inventory  can  be  developed  for  large  institutional, 
commercial,  and  residential  buildings,  where  rainwater 
harvesting units can be installed.

To implement urban design and landscape 
interventions for increased permeability 
of urban spaces, reduced runoff, and 
facilitate groundwater recharge which will 
support water resource conservation.

BRIEF

According  to  the  Gujarat  Integrated  Township  Act,  2008,  20 
percent  of  built  urban  landscape  should  have  green  cover/
vegetation.  However,  rapid  urbanism  changes  the  land  cover 
to impervious surface and leads to problems like urban water 
logging,  degradation  of  the  groundwater  table,  etc.  The  city 
will  integrate  the  policy  with  specific  plantations  leading 
to  water  recharge.  The  city  will  also  develop  guidelines  for 
impervious  surface  construction  to  increase  groundwater 
recharge.  Techniques  such  as  permeable  pavements  on 
footpaths, tabletops, and traffic refuge islands can also add to 
groundwater recharge. Development of the Tapi riverfront can 
incorporate  urban  design,  supporting  the  initiative.  The  city 
will  use  pollinator-friendly  plants  in  parks  and  medians,  and 
plants that produce less litter, to for a cleaner environment.

BACKGROUND

Surat  is  the  eighth  largest  city  in  terms  of  population,  and 
largest among noncapital cities, in India. As per the Mayor’s 
foundation  report,  Surat  is  the  fourth  fastest  growing  city 
globally, with a decadal growth of 55 percent to 60 percent 
in the last four decades. The GDP rate is 11.5 percent. Among 
the highest income tax paying cities in Asia in 2010–11, Surat 
contributed Rs. 22,000 million to the national exchequer. It 
has  the  highest  average  annual  household  income  and  has 
practically zero percent unemployment. 

Crisil and ICRA have graded Surat at the top of the list as an 
urban  civic  body  on  operating  and  financial  efficiency.  The 
city has a very vibrant economy. It is the hub of the diamond 
and textile industries. 

The  current  economy  of  Surat  is  dominated  by  diamond 
cutting,  textiles,  gold  thread  making,  dyeing,  and  printing 
industries that cater to both domestic markets and exports. 
Diamond cutting and polishing, however, mainly cater to the 
export  market.  The  medium-  and  large-scale  industries  are 
mostly located in the five industrial estates in and around the 
city. The city accounts for: 

   90 percent of the world’s total rough diamond cutting and 

polishing; 

   99.99 percent of the nation’s total rough diamond cutting 

and polishing; 

   90 percent of the nation’s total diamond exports; 
   60 percent of the nation’s total man-made fabric 

production; 

   28 percent of the nation’s total manmade fiber production; 
   18 percent of the nation’s total man-made fiber export; 
   12 percent of the nation’s total fabric production; and
   14 percent of the nation’s total foreign exchange. 

Along  with  textiles  and  diamonds,  other  sectors  in  the  city 
include petroleum, oil and gas, shipping, cement, metallurgy, 
paper,  chemical,  fertilizer,  etc.  Hazira 
INA,  Magadalla, 
Ichchhapore, and Olpad near Surat have giant industries, such 
as  Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Corporation  Limited,  Gas  Authority 
of  India  Limited,  ABG  Shipyard,  Narmada  Cement,  Ambuja 
Cement, Ultratech Cement, NTPC-KGPP Power Plant, ESSAR 
group  of 
Industries  (steel/power/chemical/oil/shipping), 
Larsen  &  Toubro,  and  Reliance 
Industries.  Microsoft’s 
CityNext  initiative  has  tied  up  with  information  technology 
(IT)  services  majors,  Tata  Consultancy  Services  and  Wipro, 
to leverage technology for the sustainable growth of cities in 
India. The first smart IT city in India is being constituted by 
the Microsoft CityNext Initiative in Surat, Gujarat. 
In  general,  Surat’s  industrial  system  is  a  complex  blend  of 
home-based,  small-scale,  and  medium-scale 
industries 
largely  dependent  on  semi-skilled  and  unskilled  labor.  In-
migration  from  other  states  is  encouraged  to  meet  the 

demands of labor in these industries.
If  looked  through  the  resilience  lens,  the  economy  of  Surat 
is  heavily  dependent  on  two  dominant  sectors,  diamond 
and textile. These two income generators are dependent on 
global markets and economy. Recession in these two sectors 
has  a  significant  impact  on  the  economy  of  the  city.  Thus, 
the city should invite different alternative industrial sectors, 
such as technology, automobile, tourism, food industry, etc., 
as backup livelihood providers in case of economic crisis. In 
addition, there is no comprehensive and organized framework 
for skill upgradation in the city.

RESILIENCE CHALLANGES

Access  to  Finance:  The  economy  of  the  city  is  strong,  but 
there  are  also  issues  like  income  disparity.  Small-scale 
industries and businesses need easy access to finances such 
as soft loans at low interest rates, subsidies, insurances, etc. 

Monochrome  Livelihood  Opportunities:  Since  the  diamond 
and textile industries are the two major employers in the city, 
there  is  limited  diversity  of  opportunity.  Lack  of  resilience 
prevails in the economy. The city needs to provide a platform 
to  make  the  existing  sectors  stronger  and  sustainable, 
besides providing space for new sectors to grow.
  
Unregulated  Industries:  The  city  has  a  large  number  of 
industries  clustered  in  specific  locations.  Much  of  the 
activities in these areas go unregulated due to limited access 
and  policing.  Industrial  safety  norms  and  environmental 
policies  should  be  enforced  strictly  through  regular  audits 
and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) activities.

Education Level and Lack of Skill Training: There are many 
educational  institutions  within  the  city.  Unfortunately,  they 
lack in quality of education and skill development programs.

BACKGROUND

RESILIENCE CHALLANGES

Situated on the banks of the river Tapi, in close proximity to 
the Arabian Sea, Surat has a sensitive ecosystem. Industrial 
growth,  and  high  population  growth  and  density  place 
pressure on the ecosystem of Surat. The two important tasks 
to be attended in Surat are: implementation of environmental 
policies such as Coastal Regulation Zones; and enforcement 
of  laws  in  industrial  areas.  There  is  a  need  for  more  green 
spaces to be developed and maintained. The Tapi is depleting 
due to rapid siltation and development activities taking place 
along both sides of the river. Pollution level checks should be 
carried  out  on  a  regular/frequent  basis.  The  environmental 
cell  should  be  active  and  efficient  in  monitoring  air,  sound, 
land, and water pollution throughout the city. 

Water and Sewerage: River Tapi is one of the major sources 
of  water  available  to  Surat.  This  has  led  to  the  discharge 
of  domestic  used  water  and  sewage  from  peri-urban  areas 
into  the  river.  Pollution,  including  disposal  of  sewage  and 
industrial effluents, and reservoir impoundment vegetation, 
has  led  to  growth  of  algae,  underwater  hydrilla,  and  water 
hyacinth. Reuse of water is negligible, with only 2 percent of 
water being reused in the city. Water conservation practices 
are  lacking  in  the  city.  A  reduction  in  the  water  table  and 
groundwater pollution are noticed in many areas.  

Solid Waste: The SMC currently manages about 1750 MT of 
solid waste per day. Around 98 percent off total solid waste 
generated is disposed of effectively through well-established 
sanitary  landfills,  centralized  bio-medical  waste  collection, 
transportation, treatment, and final disposal facilities. These 
landfill  and  dumping  sites  are  a  problem  and  account  for 
greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Hence,  efforts  are  required  to 
segregate and reuse the waste. The initiative for solid waste 
management  (SWM)  initiatives,  with  regard  to  the  new 
Management  of  Solid  Waste  (MSW)  Rules,  2015,  are  to  be 
mandated in the city.

Air Quality: Vehicular pollution accounts for 60–70 percent 
of  the  total  pollution  load  of  the  city.  The  main  causes  are 
two-wheelers,  auto-rickshaws,  and  multi-axle  vehicles. 
According  to  the  Gujarat  Pollution  Control  Board,  Surat  is 
one  of  the  cities  which  does  not  maintain  the  required  air 
quality  standards,  since  more  than  the  permissible  amount 
of  suspended  particulate  matter  (SPM)  has  been  recorded 
in the city (2004–05). Efforts, such as Compressed Natural 
Gas conversions in vehicles, and BRTS and Mobile Pollution 
Measuring Vans, have helped in reducing the SPM levels but 
not in reducing the greenhouse gas contribution.

Creek  Flood:  There  is  no  storage  or  control  mechanism  in 
or  around  the  tidal  creeks  in  the  city.  Development  along 
the  creeks  and  poor  maintenance  of  creek  banks  have 
led  to  siltation  and  degradation  of  water  quality.  Further, 
pollutants  discharged  from  untreated  and  unregulated 
industries  worsen  the  situation.  The  growth  of  vegetation 
and subsequent reduction in the drain areas lead to frequent 
flooding in the creeks.

Extreme  Rainfall:  Due  to  climate  change,  it  is  observed 
that  the  total  rainfall  may  be  reduced  but  the  intensity  of 
occurrence has and will continue to increase.

Industrial Accidents: Surat has a lot of industrial units, among 
which  Olpad  Cyanide  Industrial  Area  and  HNA  are  critical 
areas.  They  account  for  various  accidents,  and  this  needs 
to be addressed efficiently to avoid future risks. Also, Surat 
should  not  neglect  the  possible  risk  from  Kakrapar  Nuclear 
Power Plant situated on the banks of the river Tapi.

Salt Water Intrusion: Illegal groundwater use has been noticed 
in the city. Unregulated groundwater use will eventually lead 
to salt water intrusion through the creeks and river into the 
ground.

Heatwave:  It  has  been  observed  that  the  duration  of  the 
summer season is elongated and irregular. Heat waves have 
been  increasing  with  the  changing  climate.  This  leads  to 
health issues and currently the citizens are not aware of the 
long-term effects of a heat wave.

Insufficient  Regulation:  Lack  of  regulation  and  low  law 
enforcement  is  a  major  cause  of  all  environment-  and 
ecosystem-related  issues  in  Surat.  This  is  a  major  issue  in 
Surat,  especially  in  industrial  areas,  leading  to  unregulated 
and  untreated  industrial  discharge  into  the  river  and  air 
pollution. One of the reasons for the depletion of rivers in the 
festive seasons is due to lack of regulation and enforcement.

Lack  of  Risk  Awareness:  Sensitivity  of  the  citizens  towards 
the  environment  is  missing  in  the  city.  The  citizens  should 
be made aware of the consequences of their actions on the 
environment and thus take responsible steps.

BRIEF

Surat is highly vulnerable to multiple hydro-met hazards such 
as  river  floods,  creek  floods,  and  storm  surges.  Risk  exists 
in  Surat  since  reclaimed  land  in  the  sea  can  cause  high  tidal 
effects.  Due  to  major  industrial  activities,  fire  incidents  have 
also  been  noticed  in  the  city.  To  monitor  climate  change 
trends  and  impacts  and  to  integrate  them  with  multihazard 
risk  planning,  the  city  will  conduct  regular  GIS-based  spatial 
analysis of vulnerability and risks to strengthen preparedness 
for  future  resilience.  The  city  will  also  enhance  its  existing 
Early Warning System, which currently keeps Surat prepared 
to  mitigate  the  flood  risk.  It  can  be  linked  with  a  high-end 
Emergency  Operation  Center  (EOC)  and  mapping  of  new 
growth areas.

Initiative 5.2.3 

Pollution awareness by voluntary 

clean-up program

OBJECTIVE

To  engage  citizens  and  encourage  their 
participation in keeping the city clean and to 
generate  awareness  for  waste  segregation, 
water pollution, and reuse at home.

BRIEF

The SMC has many ongoing waste collection and city cleaning 
practices  spearheaded  by  its  solid  waste  department.  But 
citizens’  awareness  and  participation  is  currently  low.  For 
better  waste  management,  it  is  very  important  to  have  the 
support  and  participation  of  civil  society.  Awareness  will  be 
created  among  citizens,  for  instance,  by  pointing  out  water 
pollution  levels  during  festivals  and  effect  of  waste  disposal 
into  the  river.  The  following  activities  will  be  carried  out  to 
achieve this goal: 
   Create citizen awareness on waste segregation at home; 
   Organize clean-up drives in the city during the festive 

season;

   Generate awareness through electronic and print media; 
   Conduct street plays on SWM practices; and 
   Organize workshops and conferences on Clean Surat Drive.

BRIEF

The  capacity  of  institutions,  communities,  and  individuals  to 
adapt  to  climate  change  has  been  increased  with  previous 
efforts in the city under various programs. However, to ensure 
maintenance, continuous efforts are needed with the following 
activities: 
   Share the climate resilience strategy methodology with 

government agencies for peer review and learning; 

   Design and conduct local ecosystem conservation programs 

for urban practitioners; 

   Develop a resilience toolkit based on 100RC and CRF and 

introduce it to the regional and state governments; 
   Conduct capacity building workshops with relevant 

stakeholders for environmental resilience based on CRF 
components of 100RC; 

   Conduct debates on urban climate change issues; 
   Write articles in print and electronic media to spread 

awareness; and 

   Organize street plays on climate change and resilience 

issues by students.

BACKGROUND

Surat  is  a  city  of  industry  and  trade.  The  recent  population 
growth of the city is mainly due to two main labor-intensive 
industries:  textiles  and  diamond  polishing.  The  spurt  in 
the  population  is  due  to  a  combination  of  factors,  mainly 
natural  growth  and  in-migration.  Surat  claims  to  be  a  zero-
unemployment  city.  This  has  attracted  rural  migrants  from 
within  the  state  (Saurashtra  and  arid  northern  parts)  and 
other  states  (especially  Maharashtra,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and 
Orissa). 

Surat reflects the pace of Mumbai. In spite of a fast-paced life, 
social cohesion and mutual support are quite high among the 
Surtis  (that  is,  people  of  Surat).  Social  networks  are  strong 
among most communities, especially those from the arid and 
semi-arid zones of Gujarat. Research has shown that higher 
social  capacity  indices  are  observed  in  middle  and  upper 
SECs compared to lower SECs and slum dwellers, which are 
dominated by a diverse immigrant population. 

For  a  city  that  is  under  a  constant  risk  of  floods  and  other 
hydro-meteorological  disasters,  strong  social  capital  is  an 
asset.  Therefore,  strengthening  social  capacities,  especially 
among migrants, will be necessary to enable people in lower 
SECs  to  build  resilience  through  better  coordination  and 
mutual support. 

Unfortunately, the NGO and microfinance coverage in Surat 
is  limited  compared  to  many  other  Indian  cities.  Therefore, 
other avenues to build social cohesion have to be explored. .

RESILIENCE CHALLENGES

High Migration: Migration rate is growing every year and it is 
becoming increasingly difficult for the city administration to 
regulate this growth. This further increases the stress on the 
city’s  management,  existing  infrastructure,  and  crime  rates. 
Increase  in  migration  also  leads  to  increase  in  the  number 
of  slums  and  engineered  buildings  to  cater  to  the  housing 
demand.  This  leads  to  inequality  in  society,  thus  affecting 
social cohesion. 

Lacking Sense of Social Responsibility: With the increasing 
number  of  migrants,  there  is  an  underlying  feeling  among 
the  local  population  that  the  sense  of  social  responsibility 
(including contributing to city management, such as, keeping 
the city clean, following rules and regulations) has decreased 
over  time.  The  city  administration  needs  to  bring  back  this 
feeling of belonging among the citizens. 

Loss  of  Local  Culture:  Surat  is  a  major  industrial  hub, 
attracting  people  mainly  for  its  economic  opportunities. 
Increased demand for housing has also led to the demolition 
of heritage structures to give way to high-rise buildings. Surat 
is  said  to  have  lost  its  unique  culture,  since  many  different 
communities come together here for industrial activities.

Crime  and  Law  Enforcement:  The  city  needs  strong  law 
enforcement to deal with problems such as encroachment of 
public spaces, traffic jams, accidents, and crime. 

High Property Rate: Surat has a very strong real estate sector 
providing housing and building structures for both residential 
and  commercial  purposes.  The  number  of  buildings  in  the 
city has grown several-fold in the past decade. Nevertheless, 
many of these buildings cater to the needs of middle income 
and high income communities, making it unaffordable for the 
low-income  groups.  A  majority  of  home  owners  are  people 
who  have  invested  in  more  than  one  property,  therefore 
leading to an artificial housing shortage. One of the concerns 
of  the  citizens  is  the  increase  in  the  number  of  vacant  high 
income  houses,  but  shortage  in  low  and  middle  income 
houses.

Heritage restoration

OBJECTIVE

To restore and redevelop the heritage and 
cultural landmarks of the city.

OBJECTIVE

BRIEF

The city of Surat is endowed with a rich architectural heritage 
that is vital to the identity of the city. Two years ago, on World 
Heritage  Day,  the  SMC  had  announced  a  heritage  policy 
and  promised  to  protect  the  heritage  buildings  in  the  city, 
for which it set up a heritage cell. Under the heritage policy, 
2,417  properties  in  the  old  city  and  574  in  the  old  village  of 
Rander, which were 80-years-old or more, were identified for 
conservation efforts. To support this initiative and achieve the 
goal, the city will: 
   Prepare and submit a proposal, for the restoration and 
redevelopment of heritage sites, to the Archaeological 
Survey of India, and also to key business groups for 
restoration and redevelopment funding under their 
corporate social responsibility programs; 

   Develop a website dedicated to heritage issues, and 

have brochures and pamphlets to promote the heritage 
locations; and 

   Develop video and audio documentaries on Surat-specific 

heritage locations.

BACKGROUND

Public  health  is  a  major  concern  for  a  tropical  city  such  as 
Surat.  Located  in  a  nearly  flat  coastal  terrain,  Surat  was 
once  infamous  for  vector-  and  water-borne  diseases.  The 
seasonality of vector-borne diseases is likely to change, and 
the  disease  transmission  period  is  likely  to  expand,  due  to 
increases in temperatures and changes in the humid seasons. 
Many health sector studies raise concerns on the changes in 
vector  propagation  and  recommend  conducting  continued 
action  research  on  climate  and  vector-borne  diseases.  This 
is especially important since this region is a malaria-endemic 
area and faces recurrent outbreaks of leptospirosis. Location, 
climate, and socio-demographic structure, coupled with the 
developmental activities of the city, are high risk factors for 
the breeding of vectors, as well as their ability to survive and 
spread infections. 

Located on riverbanks and close to the sea, Surat has a number 
of  water  pools  which  are  breeding  sites  for  mosquitoes. 
Climate  change,  increasing  population,  high  in-migration, 
change in land use, and inaccessible services such as water 
supply, sewerage, and solid waste create an environment that 
could lead to an increase in vector-borne diseases. 

The  SMC  is  aware  of  the  situation  and  is  already  putting  in 
place clean city initiatives, including monsoon preparedness 
to  avoid  problems.  Surat  is  also  known  for  its  knowledge 
and  experience  in  managing  malaria  cases.  Various  health 
sector studies have highlighted the near-extinction of filarial 
diseases  due  to  the  extension  of  underground  sewerage 
across the city, which shows that the efforts of the ULB have 
worked.  Similarly,  malaria  is  under  control  due  to  a  strong 
citywide  monitoring  system,  which  includes  urban  health 
centers.  Mosquito  vector  control  measures,  such  as  door-
to=door monitoring to prevent breeding, a system of fines/
penalties,  and  fogging  further  reduce  the  chances  of  the 
disease occurring. 

RESILIENCE ISSUES

High  Cost  Medical  Services:  There  are  many  government 
and  private  health  care  centers,  but  the  critical  medical 
services are very expensive and therefore less accessible to 
low  income  populations.  Increase  in  the  quality  of  medical 
services for these segments is needed.

Way Forward

Surat, prima facie would work upon the prioritization of the 
initiatives.  Based  on  time  frame  and  priority,  initiatives  will 
be  implemented  in  the  city.  Despite  being  financially  more 
independent  compared  with  many  other  cites,  Surat  still 
has  to  depend  on  State  and  Central  finances  for  various 
developmental  projects.  To  incorporate  resilience  in  not 
only  the  existing  but  forthcoming  city-level  projects  as 
well and to leverage funds, the resilience strategy suggests 
developing synergy with ongoing and planned programs. The 
prioritization of the initiatives would thus help in aligning with 
the State or Central on going policies.  The resilience strategy 
includes  plans  to  inform  and  influence  State  and  National 
level stakeholders through sharing the lessons learned from 
the city resilience interventions. 

Therefore, developing a series of resilience informed, ready 
to  use  DPRs  will  be  important  for  the  city  to  access  funds 
and other resources from various programs as and when the 
opportunities  arise.  These  DPRs  will  empower  the  city  to 
leverage resources for building resilience as well as develop 
capacities to appreciate resilience. Inputs from International 
and  National  platform  and  strategic  partners  and  best 
practices will be useful for developing sector-specific DPRs.
100RC network has provided the cities, at large with refined, 
prestigious  and  excellent  expertise  platform  partner  and 
expert  advisors  to  be  associated  with  and  helping  the 
city  connect  with  them.  Identifying  and  approaching  the 
platforms partners and expert advisors would be a next step 
further  to  help  city  implement  its  resilience  initiatives  with 
peer interested partners. 

Currently,  the  city  largely  depends  on  National  and  State 
Government  funding,  apart  from  local  sources.  Surat  has  a 
wide  spread  economic  sector,  with  which  innovative  ideas 
could  be  adopted  to  raise  resources  with  public  private 
holdings.  Identifying  the  resources  would  align  the  city 
towards  Spear  Heading  implementation  of  the  resilience 
initiatives.

The best way forward is to align the city with the hierarchy 
of  the  initiatives  with  their  importance  and  the  level  of 
implementation period while connecting it with the platform 
partners, advisors, identified funds and resources with local, 
state  or  central  policies.  As  rightly  said,  now  this  is  not  the 
end; it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, 
the end of the beginning.
