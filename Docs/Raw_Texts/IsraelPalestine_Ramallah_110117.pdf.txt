Ramallah witnessed vast urbanization in the past decade, 
through the willingness and efforts of both its people 
and institutions. These efforts helped Ramallah become 
selected as a proud member of the global 100 Resilient 
Cities network. Ramallah is well situated to lead the resilience 
efforts in our evolving state, as part of our work to achieve 
our full independence and self-determination. Membership 
of the network signiﬁes a shift in establishing a vital multi-
disciplinary tactic to proactively cope, adapt and transform 
against the shocks and stresses Palestinian cities may 
encounter. 
Through its history, culture and architecture, every aspect 
of Ramallah is evidence of its resilience. Ramallah city is 
persistently overcoming obstacles, whilst transitioning with 
innovation and creativity. Nowadays, the challenges facing 
our urban condition are different and frequently altering. 
Therefore, in times of limited resources, building urban 
resilience to equip the city from the social, environmental 
and economic aspect is needed like no other time before. 
Ramallah now requires excellence in social and institutional 
transformation by employing resilience thinking in all of its operations. Involvement in this project will unite efforts, and foster 
energies through the new resilience global network.
We commend Ramallah Municipality – represented by its Mayor Mousa Hadid and its Municipal Council, staff, 100RC and the 
resilience team, all partners, and Ramallah citizens – for actively participating in the development of Resilient Ramallah 2050. 
The Office of the President and the Government of Palestine will provide all possible support needed to facilitate the strategy 
implementation, in preparation for its expansion in other Palestinian cities, and on the top is “The Jewel of the Crown”, our 
capital, Jerusalem. In this regard, we ask all local and international partners to provide support to translate this strategy into 
actions on the ground to benefit our people. This is a step further in the process of building our necessary  state institutions, 
and in support to end occupation and achieve independence and freedom for our people.

Resilient Ramallah 2050LETTER FROM HIS EXCELLENCY 
RAMI HAMDALLAH 
Prime Minister of the State of Palestine

This is a great opportunity for Ramallah and Palestine to 
integrate resilience thinking into our development paradigm, 
especially in our efforts to achieve a sustainable and viable 
Palestinian economy and overall development.
The release of Resilient Ramallah 2050 will help our efforts 
to reduce our dependency on others and contribute to a 
more holistic and integrated development in Palestine. We 
will make all efforts to capitalize on Ramallah’s excellent 
work to date and we will provide all possible support needed 
to achieve the resilience vision of Ramallah as a leading 
example in local government development.
We congratulate Ramallah municipality represented by its 
Mayor Mousa Hadid and its municipal councils, city director 
and staff, the Resilience team represented by Dr Shaheen, 
100 Resilient Cities and their partners for this excellent 
achievement. We look forward to putting this strategy into 
actions that can have positive impact on Palestinian people 
in Ramallah and Palestine.

LETTER FROM HIS EXCELLENCY 
HUSSEIN AL-ARAJ 
Minister of Local Government 

Before the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, the 
local government sector faced several economic, social 
and physical shocks related to Israeli occupation. Dealing 
with these urgent challenges diverted resources away 
from achieving our long-term vision to deliver a modern 
local government sector that provides quality services 
and is adaptable to current and future challenges. Despite 
these shocks, we have continued towards our vision with a 
strength and commitment of which we should be very proud.
In this context, it is an honour to be part of a creative and 
successful initiative: the Resilient Ramallah 2050. This 
strategy reflects our success in planning and developing 
a new non-traditional approach in local government. This 
strategy will help us enter to a new phase of investing in 
the future to deal with natural or human-made shocks and 
stresses, and to secure wellbeing and safety of our people 
in all circumstances. Additionally, the actions in the Resilient 
Ramallah 2050 strategy serve as an important milestone in 
the advancement of science and technology in Palestine and 
our quest to keep pace with leading developed nations.

Resilient Ramallah 2050 is truly forward-thinking, seeking to positively influence the resilience of Ramallah and its 
surroundings, and in doing so will provide an inspiring model for other cities in Palestine. The strategy will allow us to deal 
more effectively with a range of challenges associated with rapidly growing cities, as well as build resilience to external 
pressures that undermine Palestine’s stability and can drive internal migration, crowdedness, and socioeconomic inequality. 
These challenges have been addressed creatively in this strategy.
Finally, I would like to thank all teams who participated in completing this strategy, including the Ministry of Local Government, 
Ramallah Municipality, and the project’s Steering Committee members. Special thanks must also go to 100 Resilient Cities, 
which has provided significant support and facilitated access to a range of international experts who helped in the technical 
development of this strategy.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 2050LETTER FROM MAYOR ENG. 
MOUSA HADID
Mayor of Ramallah

Welcome to our dynamic, vibrant and optimistic city of 
Ramallah!
It has been a tremendous privilege for our city to join the 100 
Resilient Cities network. It has allowed city leaders to come 
together with a wide range of citizens representing many 
different sectors and walks of life, applying new thinking to 
the challenges facing our city. Together, we have considered 
the question: what actions must we take to ensure our city is 
truly resilient by 2050 and beyond?
Despite the complex political challenges facing our city, 
Ramallah has always stayed optimistic. Our city can 
provide an illuminating example for other cities – not only 
have we survived complex challenges presented by Israeli 
occupation – but we have witnessed rapid growth that is 
improving quality of life for many of our people, in difficult 
conditions. Despite these successes, we continue to strive 
for a better future.
Applying a resilience lens – where we consider the 
interactions between the acute shocks and chronic stresses that Ramallah may face – has helped us to identify new, 
collaborative ways of working that can help improve the lives of all Ramallites. Our work to date has also emphasized the 
important role Ramallah Municipality has in leading the charge of building resilience within the city, our region, and potentially 
even at the national level. This has evolved gradually not only through producing this strategy document, but also in 
integrating the work across the different departments and sectors in the city. 
I would like to seize the opportunity to invite you all to come and visit our vibrant and hospitable city, to enjoy its food, culture, 
history, and to socialize with our hospitable citizens. We welcome new partnerships based on mutual respect and interests – 
in Ramallah you will find open hearts, minds, and a culture of welcoming and respecting others.
Finally, I would like to thank all local citizens, partners and experts who participated actively in the development of this 
strategy. In addition to the resilience team led by Dr Mohammad Shaheen, this includes the steering committee represented 
by his Excellency Dr Hussein Alaaraj (Minister of Local Government), the Advisory Committee, Municipal Council and staff, 
City Director, members of working groups, and all those who contributed to our numerous workshops and other events. With 
our great local and international partners, we are committed to turning this strategy into reality.

LETTER FROM MICHAEL 
BERKOWITZ
President of 100 Resilient Cities

On behalf of 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the 
Rockefeller Foundation (100RC), I want to congratulate 
Mayor Hadid and the City of Ramallah on the release of 
Resilient Ramallah 2050, the city’s first Resilience Strategy. 
The Strategy is the product of much hard work and is an 
important milestone in Ramallah’s resilience journey.
A message of optimism runs through this strategy that 
reflects a key strength of Ramallah and its people. While it 
acknowledges the city’s unique position within the 100RC 
network as facing significant constraints around use of 
land, resources, and free movement of its people, Resilient 
Ramallah 2050 does not focus on what isn’t possible. Instead, 
it is a call to remain focused on what can be done, now and 
in the future, to realise the city’s great potential, develop 
resilience to whatever shocks and stresses it may face, and 
build a future in which Ramallah not only survives but thrives.
As Ramallah and surrounding cities continue their rapid 
growth, this Strategy encourages new types of partnerships. 
Closer coordination with neighbouring Al-Bireh and Beitunia 
will help Ramallah achieve its resilience goals, as well as that of the region.  Other partnerships are also critical to the city’s 
success, including new collaborations with the private and academic sectors and active engagement with the city’s various 
communities to ensure their voices and concerns are reflected in the decisions affecting them.  We are also excited by the 
relationships Ramallah will develop from our partners and cities in the 100RC network – be it learning from other cities facing 
similar challenges, or working with specialists from our Platform of Partners. 
Resilient Ramallah 2050 presents an ambitious but practical program. It includes actions in which the municipality and 
other partners can achieve immediate benefits, as well as other longer-term actions that have the potential to be truly 
transformative. 
We commend Ramallah Municipality on this enormous achievement. Though this strategy represents the end of the strategic 
planning process, it is only the beginning of the exciting work to come in the months and years ahead. And 100 Resilient 
Cities’ partnership with the city is also just beginning. 
Now we can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the following pages, which will positively 
impact the lives of all who call Ramallah home. We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner in these 
efforts.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20501110INTRODUCTION
Dr Mohammad Shaheen,               
Ramallah’s Chief Resilience Officer

It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Resilient 
Ramallah 2050. This is our city’s first ever comprehensive 
resilience strategy, which lays out a vision for a sustainable 
and optimistic city that is resilient to any challenge it may 
face.
Although Ramallah is a relatively small city in size and 
population, we have been able to grow, thrive and become 
a model city in Palestine and the region. Ramallah has 
managed to demonstrate resilience despite conflict and 
continuous political and environmental stresses. The 
importance of this Strategy is to join forces under a common 
vision and framework, integrating efforts to achieve benefits 
that may not be possible through working separately.  
As our city grows, the challenges we face become 
increasingly interconnected. The growth of Ramallah 
as a center for employment presents not only a huge 
opportunity, but also significant challenges for mobility and 
service provision that extend beyond municipal borders. 
Additionally, our city relies almost entirely on water and 
energy resources controlled by Israel, leaving us vulnerable 
to supply disruptions. 
Addressing these and other challenges requires us to rethink 
our ways of working, embracing new kinds of collaboration 
across sectors and levels of government. As someone who 
has spent his career working as a public health professional, 
but without a background in urban planning, I have learnt 
so much from collaborating with others and considering 
different perspectives on how to realize Ramallah’s amazing 
potential. This also requires us to listen to community 
members who bear the consequences – positive or 
otherwise – of many of the decisions we make about our city.
It is in this spirit that we have identified the 37 tangible 
resilience-building actions outlined in this strategy. These 
are distinct, yet connected actions to be delivered over 
different spatial scales and timeframes. This includes a mix 
of ‘quick win’ actions (which involve building on our strengths 
and scaling up current efforts to achieve immediate 
benefits) and longer-term actions with the potential to be 
truly transformative for the resilience of Ramallah and its 
surroundings. While Ramallah Municipality will take a leading 

role in implementing many of the actions, all actions will 
require collaboration and some will be led by other partners. 
I cannot emphasize enough the role of Ramallah citizens in 
the journey to date – this Strategy benefits from the insights 
of numerous city professionals who are already working to 
make Ramallah more resilient. This includes the Ramallah 
Mayor Eng Mousa Hadid; City Director Ahmad Abu Laban; 
Ramallah Municipal Council members; the Governor of 
Ramallah and Al-Bireh District; Directors of the departments 
and staff within Ramallah Municipality; the public and private 
sectors; the many Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) 
currently implementing resilience-building projects within 
Ramallah and its surroundings, and the unconditional 
support of Dr Hussein Ala’raj, the Minister of Palestinian 
Local Government.
We have also drawn on significant support and expertise 
from around the world. This pioneering work would not have 
been possible without unconditional support from 100 
Resilient Cities, as well as our Strategy Partner, AECOM.

Now, we must unite to fully implement the Resilient Ramallah 
2050 strategy; integrate resilience thinking in the way we 
work, and create the next generation of resilience-building 

actions. We must act together to ensure a secure and 
prosperous future for ourselves and future generations.

To support our Resilient Ramallah vision we will take action in three strategic directions:

 Regaining Control                                                   

We will foster a culture of self-determination and build the self-sufficiency of our city 

and its people

 Responsive Governance

We will renew our governance structures to increase transparency, collaboration,  

evidence-based decision making, and meaningful community engagement

 Realising Potential

We will build prosperity by making the most our city’s unique mix of cultural,  

intellectual, physical and natural assets

RESILIENCE?

Urban resilience describes the 

capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems 
within a city to survive, adapt, and 
grow no matter what kinds of chronic 
stresses and acute shocks they 

experience.

Resilient Ramallah 2050 considers how shocks that affect us 
on a short time-scale can interact with the chronic stresses 
that weaken the fabric of our city on a day-to-day or cyclical 
basis. By addressing these interactions and finding ways to 
better meet the needs of communities in good times, we also   
improve our ability to respond to, and bounce back from, a 
range of disruptive events.

100RC has assisted Ramallah in many ways: 
•   Funding the role of a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) in Ramallah Municipality to coordinate our resilience-building 
efforts
•  Offering expert support through partner organisations to deliver this strategy and support engagement with 
Ramallah citizens
•  Connecting Ramallah through a global network of peer cities to share ideas and solutions – this includes  
participating in annual summits with the CROs of all other cities in the network, as well as more targeted exchange 
events, such as a Migration Exchange in Athens
•   Access to the 100RC Platform – a group of leading service providers who so far have offered preliminary, in-kind 
support around issues of water and wastewater management in Ramallah.

Resilience Framework (CRF) and 
“resilience lens”
Resilient Ramallah 2050 has benefited from a range of 
valuable tools that help cities prioritize their resilience 
challenges and opportunities, as well as increase the 
resilience value of potential actions:
•  Cities throughout the 100RC network use the City 
Resilience Framework (CRF, below) to help them 
understand the complex and overlapping systems that 
contribute to their resilience. The CRF comprises four 
dimensions and 12 drivers that together illustrate what 
make a city resilient.
•   The “resilience lens”, which we used to sharpen our 
thinking and inform the design of the specific resilience-
building actions described from page 54 in this strategy. 

•  To apply the resilience lens, we asked if proposed actions:
 - Approach risks and vulnerabilities in a cross-sector and 
comprehensive way
 - Consider the impact of multiple shocks and stresses
 - Aim to support equitable outcomes
 - Incorporate the relevant qualities of resilient systems 
(shown opposite)
 - Use the ability and capacities of a broad group of 
stakeholders
 - Consider the possible consequences (direct and 
indirect) over different time scales
 - Consider regional, national and international 
implications.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20501918Resilient Ramallah 205019RAMALLAH SNAPSHOT

Perched some 880m above sea level, Ramallah means God’s 
Hills in Arabic. It is a fitting name for the city that became 
the administrative center for the Government of the State of 
Palestine, the Palestine National Authority (PNA), in 1994.   
Located approximately 16km north of Jerusalem in the 
Palestinian West Bank, Ramallah was originally established 
in the mid-1500s by the Haddadin family as a Christian 
village. It grew throughout the 17th and 18th centuries 
as a predominantly agricultural village, and by the mid-
1800s, missionary groups had built different schools and 
churches. The demographics of our city changed  as more 
people moved to the newly incorporated city in the early 
1900s, attracted by high living standards that resulted from 
developing trade routes with the USA. 
Since then, our prosperity, continuity and identity have been 
tested through separate periods of occupation and mass 
immigration. Today, the State of Palestine remains under 
Israeli occupation, meaning we lack control over Palestinian 
resources that are crucial for our resilience, including 
mobility, land, borders and water.

Despite these conditions, Ramallah is a proud, growing 
and cosmopolitan city. As the seat of the Government of 
the State of Palestine, our city is a base for many major 
organisations, including NGOs and banks.  It is also home 
to a burgeoning arts and cultural scene. We are a city that 
embraces diversity, free exchange of ideas, creativity, and 
respects the human and cultural rights of its residents and 
visitors.
Ramallah also has an increasingly international outlook. 
Not only are we proud to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities 
network, but we also have formal connections with more than 
30 cities from all over the globe, such as Toulouse in France, 
Johannesburg in South Africa, Trondheim in Norway and 
Amsterdam in Holland. Through these connections we seek 
to represent the voice of our city, share knowledge and help 
implement best practice initiatives for our citizens.

CHALLENGES AND 
OPPORTUNITIES

LEBANON

SEA

We have constrained mobility 
and access to resources
While Ramallah sits mostly within Area A (see opposite), 
the movement of people and resources between Ramallah, 
other Palestinian cities and the wider region is severely 
MEDITERRANEAN
constrained by the belt of Areas ‘B’ and ‘C’ that surround 
our city, as well as the lack of control over borders. With 
requirement to pass through regular checkpoints and the 
risk of unexpected route closures, commuters regularly 
suffer long delays, and supply chains become disrupted with 
serious implications for business continuity.
Presently, we are almost entirely dependent on others for 
energy and water. Our electricity supply company, Jerusalem 
District Electricity Company (JDECo), does not possess any 
of its own power stations – it buys over 95% of electricity 
from the Israel Electricity Corporation, and the rest from 
Jordan. Similarly, access to water resources is controlled 
by Israel. Although the second Oslo Accord made provision 
for Palestinian access to the Mountain Aquifer, Article 40 
requires Israeli approval for any proposed Palestinian water 
management measure or infrastructure project, which limits 
the development of new wells.
Waste is collected and sent to a distant landfill. This is 
expensive, the facility is nearing capacity and road closures 
can disrupt access. There is also a missed opportunity to 
capitalize on the potential to reuse the plastic and paper 
locally and potentially generate energy from residual waste.

EGYPT

What are the Oslo Accords? What about Areas A, B and C? 
Designed to provide a framework for resolving the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Oslo Accords (1993-1995) 
provided a level of self-determination for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It led to an interim government 
for the State of Palestine and created three tiers of administration for land in the West Bank: Area ‘A’ (18% of land area) 
under Palestinian civil administration and security control; Area ‘B’ (22%) under Palestinian civil administration but 
shared security control with Israel, and Area ‘C’ (60%) under Israeli civil and security control.

Source: Ramallah Municipality, 2017.

Limited space to develop 
The grey areas in the map on the opposite page show that 
our urban area has grown significantly between 2006 and 
2016. 
Ramallah’s ability to expand further is constrained by 
several challenges. The realities of the Oslo Accords make 
new  development difficult outside of Area A, and the hilly 
topography means that development in many vacant areas is 
either technical not feasible or commercially unviable.
At present, the steepest slopes that are developed have a 
gradient of around 30 percent. There is only around 250ha 
of land remaining within Area A – where development is 
largely under Palestinian control – that has a gradient within 
this range, as shown in green. Although this has resulted 
in an increase in land values, it has reduced affordability 
of property and housing, which is a growing challenge for 
many residents. Areas where it is still possible to build are 
often disconnected from the main urban area and transport 
infrastructure connection requires Israeli approval.
Accommodating expected population growth in the coming 
years requires us to be more innovative with the land we do 
control. 
This means looking into new ways to build higher densities, 
supported by rigorous standards and guidelines that 
support resilience outcomes.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20502524Our governance is complex 
and unique
The complexities of the Oslo Accords ensure Ramallah sits 
at the heart of a complicated governance structure unlike 
any other in the world. This affects all aspects of life, with 
significant implications for managing resources, delivering 
infrastructure, and ultimately, improving the resilience of our 
city.
More locally, rapid growth means our city has now become 
a conurbation – a contiguous urban area that joins to 
the neighbouring urban areas of the cities of Al-Bireh 
and Beitunia. As such, there is an increasing need for the 
three municipalities to unite to deliver cross-boundary 
infrastructure; share data; attract development funding more 
effectively, and realize potential efficiencies from shared 
service delivery.
Compared to some cities in the 100RC network, a 
democratic governance model remains relatively new in 
Ramallah. This means there is not a well-established culture 
of community participation in government decision-making, 
which is recognized in the City Resilience Framework as an 
important component of a resilient city. However, we have 
already made great strides in this area through different 
participatory mechanisms and we acknowledge improving 
two-way dialogue with communities as an ongoing priority. 
This needs to be supported by a clearer and consistently 
enforced framework of laws protecting the rights of citizens.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20502726Resilient Ramallah 205027Our economic development 
must be more proactive 
The establishment of the PNA has created tens of thousands 
of new jobs in the civil service, as well as attracting numerous 
international and local NGOs, along with the headquarters 
of large corporations, countries’ diplomatic representatives 
and banks. Despite higher-than-average salaries, the cost of 
living is also significantly higher than elsewhere in Palestine. 
With this comes greater use of bank loans to cover the cost 
of housing and to buy non-appreciating assets, such as cars.
Despite major growth, our economy remains very vulnerable. 
The Government and civil service that drive our economy 
are heavily dependent on foreign aid and donor investment, 
which could potentially be diverted elsewhere with short 
notice. However, perhaps our biggest economic vulnerability 
results from the uncertainty caused by long years of 
occupation and disruptions to supply chains. At present, all 
goods need to be cleared by Israeli authorities, which can 
deter tourism and international investment.
Despite the challenges, Ramallah is now a relatively attractive 
place to do business. We have an opportunity to be more 
proactive about our economic objectives by clearly signalling 
to potential investors about our growth sectors and ensuring 
that this growth delivers social and environmental benefits, 
invests in our cultural assets, and reduces dependency on 
the donor community.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20502928Our cultural identity 
must thrive in the face of 
challenges
Cultural heritage is much more multi-faceted than 
monuments and historical assets. For Ramallah, our tangible 
and intangible cultural heritage encompasses the city itself; 
our mountainous natural setting; traditions and rituals; 
religious institutions; past achievements, and even our 
shared experience of the ongoing political conflict.
Ramallah’s long history has been influenced by a wide 
range of civilizations that have helped shape Palestinian 
culture. In the face of occupation, we see our culture as a 
crucial tool for asserting our own identity as a city – a place 
that treasures the values of diversity, inclusion, equity, 
sustainable development, active citizenship, gender equality 
and intellectual freedom. Many of these values date back 
to Ramallah’s foundation and actively support our city’s 
resilience.
As our three cities of Ramallah, Al-Bireh and Beitunia – 
which have differing socio-cultural histories – have begun 
to physically connect as one integrated urban area, we 
can face differences of opinion around shared cultural 
values. However, this is dwarfed by the challenge posed 
by occupation, which places constraints on freedom of 
expression and our ability to put legal frameworks in place to 
support this. It also limits public access to many cultural and 
natural assets that are important to Palestinians. 

The resilience value of 
cultural assets
•  A well-conserved natural and historic environment 
that draws on traditional knowledge and skills can 
considerably reduce vulnerability factors, as well 
as strengthening the resilience of communities to 
natural disasters
•   Cultural heritage makes a direct and major 
contribution to  economic development around the 
world, providing significant employment
•   Cultural heritage can be a powerful mechanism for 
organising communities and supporting mental and 
spiritual wellbeing.
To help maximise these resilience benefits, Ramallah 
Municipality will develop an Integrated Cultural 
Strategy. It will create a clear vision and framework 
to support organisations within the city to integrate 
cultural considerations into their work. See page 112 
for more detail.

We also need to take into consideration the 26,000 refugees 
that live in camps around our city region. Although there 
is complex politics around their assimilation and the ‘right 
of return’ to their original homes in historical Palestine, our 
refugees are affected by how our city develops and their 
voices need to be included in decision-making.

Athens Migration Exchange?

In September 2016, Ramallah’s Chief Resilience Officer joined 
counterparts from Athens, Los Angeles, Medellin, Paris, 
Montreal, Thessaloniki and Amman in Athens, Greece, for a 
three-day Network Exchange. The aim was to connect with 
global experts and share city-level approaches to addressing 
common challenges around migrant integration in urban 
settings.
Whereas most of the cities participating in the exchange face 
increasing pressures due to refugees arriving from other 
countries, Ramallah brought a different experience.
Palestine’s main challenge is the displacement of its own 
people due to ongoing occupation. This has resulted in 
significant migration of Palestinians to other countries, as 
well as over 700,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) 
– people that have been uprooted from their homes but 
are living elsewhere within the West Bank or Gaza. Three 
quarters of these people have settled in surrounding cities, 
towns, and villages, while the rest live in crowded camps that 
present great economic, social, psychological, health, and 
environmental challenges.

Who?

•  Eight cities representing seven countries and 3 regions
•   22 resilience practitioners, including 8 CROs and 14 city staff
•   30 experts from businesses, NGOs, academia, local leadership and the 100RC Platform of Partners

What? 
•  3 days of site visits, presentations and working sessions
 - Day 1 – Challenges: CROs shared their perspectives on the challenges at hand. A panel, including 
representatives of the migrant community and local organizations, kicked off a series of site visits highlighting 
local approaches in Athens, such as its Relocation Scheme Program.
 - Day 2 – Solutions: multi-disciplinary groups worked around the themes of infrastructure, social cohesion and 
economic development, to arrive at new practices and solutions for managing urban migration while building 
resilience.
 - Day 3 – What’s next? Teams distilled conclusions, leading to a set of promising practices to share with Mayors 
and the broader 100RC network. It was also decided to establish an ongoing Learning Community focused on 
cities and migration.

Outcomes
The Network Exchange led to four aspirations, underpinned by 13 more specific strategic approaches that CROs and other 
Exchange participants recommend for cities as they tackle the challenges presented by global trends in migration.
While not all the strategic approaches below will be directly applicable in Ramallah, the conclusions of the exchange will still 
be important for to our city and Nation. Firstly, many of the approaches below can help us improve the integration of displaced 
people, thereby enabling more meaningful contributions to our society and economy. Additionally, strengthened efforts to 
improve the resilience of migrants around the world – informed by the aspirations and strategic approaches – stand to benefit 
the many members of the Palestinian diaspora who find themselves displaced from their homeland. However, Ramallah 
stressed the importance of respecting the rights of all refugees and IDPs to return to their own homes, especially when they 
are forced to flee or escape their homes by acts of war or violence, as is the case for Palestinian refugees.      

Embrace and integrate newcomers: 
By welcoming and integrating migrants, inclusive and 
cohesive cities become better places for everyone, 
especially their most vulnerable residents.
•   Promote programs that reduce real or perceived 
competition among newcomers and native residents.
•   Create programs that foster regular interactions between 
new and existing populations to strengthen communal 
bonds and mitigate the effects of false stereotypes.
•   Promote migration through a narrative that emphasizes 
common goals and opportunities.

Lead for change: 
By partnering with local, national, and international actors, 
leading cities create an environment for the successful 
reception and integration of newcomers.
•   Actively campaign to receive policy and funding support 
for better managing migrant reception and integration in 
urban areas.
•   Fill in policy and funding gaps creatively by tweaking local 
mandates and leveraging public-private partnerships.
•   Improve coordination with humanitarian aid agencies, 
NGOs, businesses and local organizations, to avoid 
duplications and maximize impact.

Thrive together: 
By valuing and leveraging the talent of migrants, equitable 
cities create opportunities for all residents.
•   Improve access to capital and purchasing power of 
migrants and other vulnerable groups.
•   Lower barriers to entry for immigrant-owned businesses.
•   Leverage technology to match skills with employment 
opportunities or needs from the informal economy.

Plan for a dynamic future:
By embracing global migration and incorporating human 
flows into urban planning, adaptive cities prepare, transform, 
and thrive in the face of a dynamic future.
•   Incorporate migration considerations into the design of 
key services and infrastructure.
•   Establish a city-level office dedicated to the successful 
integration of newcomers.
•   Form a city-wide strategy to address migration holistically.
•   Develop more effective and granular data collection to 
tailor and improve integration initiatives.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20503332We are vulnerable to acute 
shocks and climate change
Ramallah is at risk from many shocks – relatively short 
events with potentially catastrophic impacts – including 
earthquakes, severe weather and political and social 
instability.   
Ramallah sits within a seismically active area, with the Dead 
Sea Transform (the point at which the African and Asian 
tectonic plates meet) running along the line of the Israel/
Jordan border and the River Jordan. Major earthquakes 
hit the region in 1927 and 1943, and seismologists have 
concluded that another major event is statistically overdue. 
Although Ramallah does not sit within the highest risk areas, 
building codes for earthquake resilient design came into 
effect in 2016. There is concern that a major earthquake 
would cause significant damage to buildings and loss of lives. 
Given the elevation of Ramallah, our city is also subject to 
winter snow storms and sudden heavy rain. These have been 
particularly disruptive in recent years, interrupting electricity 
supplies, closing roads, and disproportionately affecting 
vulnerable communities such as our elderly and sick. As 
snow melts, this can cause surface flooding and overwhelm 
our drainage capacity.

Ramallah will face all these challenges in the context of 
increasing pressures from climate change. Research by the 
Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle (GLOWA) project 
found that the Palestinian territories can expect an increase 
in the frequency and duration of extreme droughts, leading 
to reduced recharge of groundwater bores, along with 
increased salinity and pumping costs.

Occupation limits our options for adapting to these 
challenges; for example, we are not permitted to establish 
our own new sources of potable water. However, we have a 
long history of ingenuity and will look at all available options 
to meet the needs of our people.

Local efforts to build resilience – Emergency Council

The Ramallah-Al-Bireh Governorate convenes an Emergency Council which aims to coordinate actions, share 
resources and provide support as needed from other stakeholders – this includes the Palestinian Red Crescent 
Society, police, transportation, fire, electricity, water and sewage network. Although not specifically required under 
the Local Authority Law, Ramallah Municipality has taken over additional responsibilities for emergency services and 
therefore is a key member of the Emergency Council.
The Emergency Council provides a great platform for us to build off in the future. However, much remains that can be 
done in the areas of risk mitigation and preparedness, as well as clarifying responsibilities for response and recovery. 
An important aspect is better integrating our efforts around disaster risk, with efforts in the city to tackle chronic 
stresses that reduce the capacity of Ramallah residents to withstand and bounce back from disruptive events.

RAMALLAH

This section describes 37 specific and interrelated actions 
that will help us build a Resilient Ramallah. The actions are 
arranged under three strategic directions, each of which 
focuses on a different area where we need to focus our 
efforts if we are to achieve our 2050 vision for a Ramallah 
that is optimistic, sustainable, inclusive, proud of its own 
culture, and in control of its own destiny. 
Each strategic direction is underpinned by a series of more 
specific goals. While Ramallah Municipality will take a leading 
role in implementing many of the actions, all actions will 
require collaboration, and some will be led by other actors. In 
particular, our city’s educational institutions, private sector 
organisations and NGOs hold significant expertise and 
knowledge about Ramallah that will be a crucial ingredient 
for successful implementation. Where possible, the actions 
in this Strategy build off the significant existing efforts 
of people leading the charge for resilience in Ramallah 
– specific examples of leading practice are highlighted 
throughout this section.

Resilience is an ongoing journey of adapting to a 
changing world. This means we need to continue 
developing innovative resilience-building actions 
for Ramallah and its surroundings. If you or your 
organisation has any ideas for actions that align 
with our strategic priorities and goals, or would like 
to participate in any of the actions described in this 
Strategy, please contact cro@ramallah.ps.

REGAINING CONTROL

We will foster a culture of self-determination and build 
the self-sufficiency of our city and its people

A common thread running through all of Ramallah’s 
resilience challenges is control. In one sense, this is 
not unique to Ramallah – in an increasingly globalized 
world, many of the issues facing cities are out of their 
direct area of influence. However, continued Israeli 
control over much of the West Bank constrains our 
ability to adapt to emerging stresses and reduce our 
vulnerability to disruptive shocks.
First and foremost, this strategic priority is about 
acknowledging what we do and can control, and where 
we can act now to support the needs and aspirations 
of people living in Ramallah and its surroundings. 
Globally, cities are taking their future into their own 
hands and leading the resilience agenda. In Ramallah 
this means trialling innovative approaches to ensure 
our residents have access to reliable, safe and 
affordable basic services, including water, energy, 
housing, education, work and health care. 

However, in the longer term, our resilience relies 
on regaining control over our own resources. While 
ingenuity and adaptability can enable us to survive 
occupation, enduring resilience means having control 
over the natural resources required to meet our basic 
needs, as well as free movement of our people.
While restrictions on movement remain within the 
West Bank, we must do all we can to enable efficient 
and equitable mobility within Ramallah, in line with 
international laws, conventions and resolutions. 
We must also set a clear and proactive direction 
on the future of our economy, supported by urban 
development that encourages and enables healthy 
and resilient lifestyles, as well as a healthy natural 
environment.

 Regaining Control

Local efforts to build resilience – Joint Coordination Unit
The Joint Coordination Unit (JCU) was established in 2006 to help the three municipalities to coordinate efforts 
in tackling cross-boundary challenges, such as joint infrastructure, economic development and social services. 
The ambition for coordination is to provide more cost-effective service delivery across waste management 
and transportation, as well as use the economies of scale of the three municipalities to more effectively access 
development funding. Achievements to date include:
•   Development of the Strategic Development Plan (2007-2011) and the Investment Plan
•   Joint Service Solid Waste Plan
•   Traffic and Transportation Plan.

wide environmental resource strategies for 
Energy, Water and Waste

PP

We will develop an integrated group of strategies that 
support efficient ways of meeting the demand for natural 
resources in Ramallah and its surroundings. This will 
incorporate the expected effects of projected climate 
change, as well as forecast population and demographic 
changes. This will inform a program of specific, related 
sub-actions across the areas of Energy, Water and Waste, 
incorporating a mixture of technological and behavioural 
interventions.

Resilience Value
Accounting for Ramallah’s future natural resource needs 
will help us withstand disruption and adverse environmental 
impacts. The strategies will support experimentation and 
build resourcefulness within government, industry and 
households.

Local Efforts to Build 
Resilience – Supporting 
renewable energy  

Energy security is of paramount importance. 
However, as development of strategic infrastructure 
is restricted, more localised solutions have to be 
found. We are working to reduce the energy demand 
of the city, such as through roll-out of low energy LED 
street lighting, and installing electricity generating 
photovoltaic (PV) cells on public buildings – including 
15kw systems on the House of Expertise and Cultural 
Palace. With new rules that allow excess electricity 
generated to be sold back to the grid, and the falling 
cost of panels, PV is becoming more viable and we will 
support more widespread roll out. 

ACTION 1a: Building 
stakeholder outreach into 
waste management research
This sub-action will extend an existing pilot study on 
household waste management being led by Ramallah 
Municipality. It will broaden the options being considered 
throughout produce life cycles, evaluate the overall impact 
of the social, economic and environmental impacts and 
engage more directly with communities to understand 
behaviours, stakeholder needs and adaptive capacity for 
new approaches.
ACTION 1b: Scale-up use 
of decentralized renewable 
energy approaches
Building on the successful wide-spread distribution of solar 
heating systems across the city, Ramallah municipality 
will work to scale up the delivery of renewable energy 
infrastructure. This will be undertaken in collaboration with 
local partners to identify the most appropriate technologies 
and sites to accommodate increased capacity.  

ACTION 1c: Work to remove 
barriers to developing an 
energy-from-waste facility
Given Ramallah’s dual challenges with security of energy 
supply and waste disposal, the potential resilience value of 
this approach is high. This project will seek both successful 
examples and partners who can deliver this approach in 
a way that safeguards public health (e.g. appropriate air 
emissions). Specific considerations will include scale, 
technology, gasification, pyrolysis, permitting requirements 
and financial viability.
ACTION 1d: Expand and 
improve the wastewater 
system to cover all of 
Ramallah
In accordance with international standards, Ramallah 
Municipality will work to expand existing sewerage network 
to cover the greater Ramallah expanding the waste water 
sewerage network and treatment plant capacity.

ACTION 1e: Develop pilot 
studies designed to test 
more diverse use of treated 
wastewater across Ramallah
Involving municipality, stakeholders, private sector, 
institutions and platform partners to test the potential for 
more diverse reuse of treated water in Ramallah, as well as 
Al-Bireh and Beitunia. We will look at opportunities for reuse 
within households, such as toilet flushing etc.
ACTION 1f: Increase water 
resources
A programme comprising multiple initiatives, including 
regulations requiring rain-fed cisterns in new buildings; 
rehabilitating old pipe systems to reduce water loss; capacity 
building within the water authority to plan and manage water 
resources, and launch an international advocacy program 
to secure Palestinian access to its water resources that 
are currently controlled by Israel. The programme will be 
a coordinated effort between Ramallah Municipality and 
the water authority and will support the aim of Palestine’s 
National Water Strategy to increase access and coverage to 
water for all uses, including tourism.
ACTION 1g: Solid waste 
management
To support the reuse of waste materials and reduce 
the volume of waste going to landfill, the Joint Service 
Council (JSC) for Solid Waste Management will develop 
a feasibility study to understand the mix of waste arising, 
including municipal and commercial waste, construction 
and demolition waste, medical and hazardous waste, and 
waste tyres, in order to identify best practice approaches, 
technologies and sites for managing these volumes of waste. 
The study will focus on the three municipalities and will seek 
to identify partners to help deliver waste reuse and recovery 
facilities.     
ACTION 1h: Increase green 
space in Ramallah
Limited land, limited water resources, weak environmental 
regulations and an increase in construction are contributing 
to shrinkage of green areas in Ramallah and surroundings. 
The city also lacks also a comprehensive strategy or vision 
on how we can stop this decline, with inadequate regulation 
exacerbating the problem. In response, this action will 
integrate maintenance and protection of green areas into the 
environmental by-laws, supported by an increased focus on 
enforcement through licencing requirements, particularly in 
new urban areas. We will also trial use of treated waste water 
in green areas in the city.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20505756PP

Ramallah, and the State of Palestine more broadly, has 
long received foreign investment from NGOs, philanthropic 
organisations and other donors. This has benefited our city 
and its resilience in many ways – critical assets such as 
roads, water and energy projects, have been delivered with 
this support from organisations. While the challenges facing 
our city mean that international aid will remain an important 
part of Ramallah’s investment mix for the foreseeable future, 
our ongoing resilience requires us to diversify approaches 
to funding and to reduce reliance on any one source. Doing 
this requires us to make better use of the resources at our 
disposal, including people of Palestinian heritage living 
overseas (i.e. ‘the diaspora’).
This action will see Ramallah Municipality partner with 
other municipalities in the region, as well as the Ramallah 
Federation – which represents around 50,000 people with 
descendants in Ramallah who currently live in the USA – to 
identify and target Palestinians in the diaspora who may be 
potential sources of investment in our area. We will draw on 
Ramallah’s strength as the banking and finance sector’s base 
in Palestine, seeking cooperation and sharing of data for 
mutual benefit.
Ramallah Municipality will take a targeted approach, 
providing candidates in the diaspora with information 
on the investment needs of the city and its residents, 
example business cases for such investment, and practical 
assistance to streamline the investment process. Linked 
closely to Action 8 in this Strategy, this action is about 
Palestinians supporting Palestinians.

Resilience Value
Encouraging investment into Ramallah will reduce 
dependency on the public sector and donor organisation 
funding, building self-sufficiency and providing an 
opportunity to attract home-grown talent back to Ramallah 
to learn from their international experience. It will also 
increase mutual communication between Ramallah and the 
Palestinian diaspora, thereby helping to build solidarity and 
shared identity in the face of challenges we face around self-
determination.

Ramallah is currently investigating major changes to its 
mobility systems, including establishing a formal public 
transport system and greater use of technology to improve 
traffic flows. A major component of the proposed approach is 
a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. With careful system design 
and the right features, like automated ticketing and priority 
traffic lighting, BRT approaches can deliver fast, reliable and 
comfortable services that serve as a viable alternative to 
private vehicle travel.
As Ramallah currently lacks formal public transport, 
this would be a major shift for our city and requires a 
comprehensive feasibility and planning study. There is a 
major opportunity to maximize the cross-cutting benefits 
(as well as to reduce unintended adverse consequences) by 
building more explicit resilience-based criteria into this study. 
Key considerations will include providing equitable access 
to the system, including vulnerable populations; ensuring 
system flexibility and redundancy that reduce disruption, and 
understanding the possible consequences for Ramallah’s 
existing shared taxi providers.
Resilience Value
This action will help improve mobility for all Ramallah 
residents, including vulnerable groups such as women who 
do not feel safe using the current shared taxi system. If 
successful, it will help reduce traffic volumes in the central 
city; improve air quality and liveability; encourage greater 
social cohesion through more communal travel; improve the 
experience of tourists, and increase accessibility of transport 
to vulnerable populations. It will also build capacity within the 
municipality around applying resilience principles in business 
case development and infrastructure design.

ACTION 3a: Run car-free 
days with free public 
transport and cultural 
activities in central Ramallah
Ramallah Municipality will collaborate with local businesses 
and relevant authorities to plan and run car-free days in 
central Ramallah, incorporating lessons learned from other 
cities in the 100RC network, such as Bogota (Colombia), 
Paris (France) and Mexico City (Mexico). The car-free day 
will include cultural events and be supported by a day of 
public transportation, helping to promote its benefits. The 
day will also include close monitoring and evaluation of how 
residents respond, including their usage patterns for the 
public transport, which can help inform any future network.
Initial car-free days will be established on festival days, feast 
days and National days, where overall traffic levels are lower. 
This will gradually extend to other days with higher traffic 
volumes – in the first year we will target 24 free-car days, 
with the potential to scale up in future years depending on 
outcomes.

However, Ramallah Municipality cannot deliver this alone 
– active participation and partnership will be required with 
the National Ministries of Health and Social Development, 
along with the academic sector, World Bank and local NGOs 
currently working to improve health outcomes in Ramallah 
and its surroundings.
We hope that, in time, this project will serve as a model for 
other cities in Palestine.
Resilience Value
This approach will provide a more resourceful, robust 
and flexible healthcare system. It will reduce demands on 
the system due to preventable and chronic conditions, 
and provide improved level of care to more residents by 
minimizing the need for sick / injured people to travel over 
great distances to receive treatment.
It will also decrease the pressure and dependency on the Red 
Crescent by increasing the capacity of community members 
in providing initial response first aid, as well as developing an 
understanding of treating minor health care issues. Better 
and more holistic health services can also make Ramallah a 
more attractive city in which to live and invest.

The increase in the population of Ramallah and surroundings 
has not been accompanied by development of sufficient 
health and social infrastructure. Available public health 
services are not adequate or universally accessible, and 
there is poor integration with secondary and tertiary health 
services that focus on prevention. A particular gap exists 
with our youth, who lack adequate programs around issues 
such as reproductive and sexual health, nutrition, smoking 
and drug use. These shortcomings leave residents and 
visitors vulnerable to different health and safety threats; 
for example, Ramallah has high incidences of psychosocial 
stress and non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer, 
diabetes, vascular diseases).
This action involves development of a comprehensive public 
and family health service for Ramallah and its surroundings. 
Comprising new facilities and programmes, it will integrate:
•   Psychosocial support services for people suffering from 
stress
•   Screening and early detection of people at risk (e.g. cancer 
screening; genetic services)
•   Training of health and social cadres in comprehensive 
primary health care 
•   A youth health program, including education and 
counselling on nutritional and behavioural determinants of 
health
•   A follow-up and specialist referral system 
•   Efficient and effective information and financial systems
•   Use of healthcare to reach out and increase engagement 
with youth and marginalized population groups.
The action proposes a revolutionary new model where our 
city’s public health system exists under the umbrella of 
Ramallah Municipality Health and Environment Department.

As an employment hub and attractive service center for 
surrounding Palestinian areas, many people come to work 
and socialize in Ramallah. A challenge is how to provide 
services for this growing number of visitors and residents 
when most are not required to make a financial contribution 
to service delivery.
At present we don’t know enough about this transient 
population. This action will better quantify the size and 
demands of this group, which will the Municipality to help 
determine and trial different models through which they can 
contribute to sustainable service provision.
Ramallah Municipality will collaborate with organisations 
who currently hold separate datasets on the transient 
population, including Al-Bireh and Beitunia municipalities, 
educational institutions, the Ministry of Transportation, and 
NGOs. This will be combined with new data gathered through 
approaches such as surveys and traffic counting.
Resilience Value
This action supports evidence-based decision-making for 
future city planning. It responds to increasing urbanisation 
and new ways of living in Ramallah and its surroundings, 
introducing new ways to generate the revenue required to 
not only meet the basic needs of residents, but also support 
economic development.

Ramallah and surrounding municipalities will form a working 
group to establish policies that encourage trials of different 
models for delivering affordable housing in accessible areas 
of Ramallah. This will consider affordability not just at point 
of purchase, but also in terms of long-term operating costs 
for residents (e.g. proximity to work and transport, energy 
efficiency).
International leading practices will be considered, including 
incentive zoning, rebates and shared ownership models. 
The longer-term aim is for successful pilot projects to inform 
future development models that meet the demands of 
Ramallah’s growing population, including those in vulnerable 
segments of the community.

Resilience Value
Safe, robust, appropriate and affordable housing supports 
the capacity of residents to work and socialize in ways 
that build healthier communities and economic growth. 
Providing more people with robust homes also increases the 
city’s resilience to shock events, such as earthquakes and 
heatwaves.

Inspiration from San Francisco – Affordable Housing 
Bonus Program 
Housing prices in San Francisco, USA, have undergone significant growth in recent years. Between 2011 and 2013, the 
average price of housing increased by 44.9%, while average monthly rents increased by 28.3%. This has required the 
City and County of San Francisco to consider its role in promoting more affordable housing for its residents.
One such approach is the Affordable Housing Bonus Program, which provides incentives for developers to include 
more affordable housing for very low-, low-, moderate- and middle-income households. Projects considered under this 
program will also need to consider the broader resilience value of the proposed development – they may not demolish 
any existing residential units, as well as providing open space and other community amenities that support healthy and 
prosperous communities.
Ramallah will collaborate with San Francisco and other cities in the 100RC network as we develop our own approaches 
to encourage more affordable housing.

Ramallah Municipality will collaborate with adjacent 
municipalities around shared environmental challenges, 
developing a new legal framework for environmental 
protection in the region, as well as increasing the 
emphasis on enforcement. Together, we will use this work 
in our metropolitan region to advocate for stronger laws, 
regulations and specifications across to be applied across 
Palestine from the National level.
The immediate focus of this action will be on the region’s 
key issue of waste disposal and management (including 
hazardous wastes). This issue has flow-on effects in a range 
of areas, such as air quality, water quality and public health.
Resilience Value
Strengthening the regulatory framework will support fairer 
outcomes, reduce environmental degradation and improve 
public health. It can also help safeguard ecosystem services 
and raises awareness of environmental protection among 
industry and the general public.

becoming the seat of the Palestinian National Authority, 
investment from both the private sector and donor 
community has frequently been reactive and not always 
linked to the needs of the city. We will build on our status to 
develop a more coordinated Local Economic Development 
Framework to proactively attract investment that not only 
bolsters our economy, but also supports a strong society. 
The municipality will work more closely with the private 
sector, donor community, neighbouring municipalities and 
National Government to develop a clear forward plan for 
economic development. We will undertake a comprehensive 
review of the economic development policy approach 
for Ramallah, to identify Local Economic Development 
Framework models which are best suited to the Ramallah 
context and to help develop an evidence-based framework 
to support growth in the tourism, industry and trade and the 
knowledge economy and education. These priority sectors 
were identified through economic analysis undertaken by our 
partner AECOM during the Resilience Strategy development 
process.
The Local Economic Development Framework will include 
a formal ‘capital projects pipeline’ that provides a long list 
of potential projects - from expression of interest to full 
business case stages. This is closely linked to Action 9, 
which will develop transparent appraisal criteria to help 
prioritize use of our limited resources towards projects 
that are likely to deliver the greatest economic impact 
and broader societal benefits. Major projects will require 
independent feasibility assessments to ensure that they are 
viable, sustainable, do not impact detrimentally on current or 
other planned activities, and provide quantified benefits that 
meet the identified needs of the residents.

Resilience Value
Focuses on delivering projects more tailored to Ramallah’s 
needs and can reduce dependency on donor-funding cycles. 
Attracts inward investment from private and institutional 
investors to provide better infrastructure, assets and 
services.

Ramallah Municipality will partner with local universities to 
develop clear and user-friendly guidelines for appraising 
the resilience value of capital investment projects.  The 
guidelines will ensure that the business cases for investment 
in capital projects maximise potential co-benefits helps 
project proponents identify unintended consequences, 
and demonstrate to insurers and investors that risks and 
opportunities have been considered early in the project 
development process.
Drawing on best practices sourced from within and outside 
the 100RC network, initially the guidelines will be trialled by 
the municipality on a future capital project such as a new 
road or municipal building. Following evaluation of the initial 
trial, the audience for the guidelines will be expanded to 
include private developers and National projects occurring 
within Ramallah. 

Resilience Value
Providing clear guidance to decision-makers and investors 
will foster long-term and integrated planning grounded in 
evidence and resilience principles. This will support truly 
sustainable developments that maximize social, economic 
and environmental co-benefits.

Local Economic Development in Casablanca – e-Medina 
Process  

Casablanca is one of Ramallah’s twin cities. e-Medina was established by tech firms in 2013 as a think-tank to explore 
how smart city principles could be applied to Casablanca. It was expanded in 2014 to invite participation from non-
private sector partners, along a ‘Cities 4P’ principle incorporating public, private and people (citizen) engagement in a 
partnership model for collaborative working. In 2015, the success of the project and the reach of its engagement saw 
it officially adopted by the Wilaya of Grand Casablanca as the basis of an official Smart City policy.
Today, the function of e-Medina is to:
•   Identify priority smart city projects for Casablanca 
•   Review project funding and financing options 
•   Help develop and review project business cases
•   Monitor project progress against indicators and initial objectives.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20507170ACTION 8: Establish a Local Economic Development Framework that supports sectors with the greatest potential for sustainable growthACTION 9: Incorporate the resilience lens into new decision-making guidelines for capital investmentPP

Ramallah Municipality will prepare guidelines on 
improving resilience through the design and form of 
urban developments. Supplementing mandatory building 
scale control and building on the emerging Palestine 
Green Building Code and City Resilience Framework, 
these guidelines will guide more strategic development of 
residential and mixed use schemes   covering issues such 
as public open space, earthquake vulnerability, onsite water 
capture and reuse, and passive design solutions.  
The Municipality Building Permits and Licencing department 
will lead the development of the guidelines in collaboration 
with the Association of Engineers. Representatives from 
the developer community will also be invited to shape the 
development of the guidelines so that the barriers and 
opportunities for delivering more resilient development, 
both from a technical as well as economic perspective, are 
reflected. 
The Municipality will promote the use of the guidelines 
for major development and require applications for major 
building permits to demonstrate how they have taken the 
guidelines into consideration. 

Resilience Value
The new guidance will set the benchmark for more resilient 
urban development in Palestine. It will provide clarity to 
developers as to the forms of development expected in 
Ramallah as well as practical approaches, based on best 
practice, as to how these can be achieved.  This means 
delivering more developments that are safe and provide for 
the needs of communities, including shared spaces that 
encourage social cohesion. The action will also help reduce 
environmental impacts and improve public health through 
reduced emissions and more walkable neighbourhoods.

Ramallah Municipality has identified a potential site for 
an accessible mixed-use development where resilience 
principles are embedded from the outset (location currently 
confidential). While development will be led by a private 
developer partner, Ramallah will mandate a set of guiding 
resilience principles to be trialled. The emerging Palestine 
Green Building Code, and leading practices from other cities. 
Key components will be citizen participation in development 
decision-making and human-centred design.
The action will partner with local academic institutions to 
establish an analytical framework to test the costs and 
benefits of different aspects of the development. The project 
will test and feed into the guidelines for resilient urban 
development described in Action 10, and lessons learnt can 
inform future development activities elsewhere in Palestine.

Resilience Value
Will provide an inclusive neighbourhood where end users’ 
needs are considered at all stages of the development 
process. Supports active experimentation (i.e. ‘living labs’), 
where lessons learnt will inform approaches to future 
planning and urban expansion in the Palestinian context.

Responsive Governance

Responsive Governance

We will renew our governance structures to increase 
transparency, collaboration, evidence-based decision 
making, and meaningful community engagement

This Strategic Priority acknowledges that responsive 
and effective governance will underpin the success 
of all other actions in this strategy. Given the 
growth of Ramallah and interdependencies with the 
municipalities of Al-Bireh and Beitunia, a key focus is 
increasing and formalising collaboration on a city-
region scale. This needs to occur alongside increased 
efforts to strengthen decision-making processes and 
the data that supports government decision-making.
In Ramallah we also need to support communities to 
be active, aware of their rights and engaged with civic 
life. This means building meaningful ways to connect 
our governance processes with everyday people – 
from providing timely and useful information, through 

to two-way mechanisms that enable our residents 
and businesses to influence decision-making. This 
can build greater levels of trust, as well as pride in our 
city and country, which is especially important given 
Palestine’s fledgling Statehood, which has now been 
recognized by 136 of 193 UN member states.
Resilient Ramallah 2050 also encourages the many 
institutions working in our city – from the National 
Government through to community groups – to 
ensure that their policies and practices actively 
consider and improve Ramallah’s resilience. This will 
require concerted efforts to build resilience capacity 
across the city, which will be supported by Ramallah 
Municipality.

Embed collaboration in our governance 
structure 

This action provides a roadmap for an effective ‘shared’ 
or ‘joint’ council model that delivers tangible actions in 
partnership. Achieving this highly collaborative future could 
be truly transformative for Ramallah and its surroundings, but 
such a fundamental shift will take time. Collaboration needs 
to include localities and cities that surround Ramallah region 
and could in time form an integrated metropolitan area. This 
action proposes the following staged actions:
1. Undertake an evaluation of the past and current 
approaches to collaboration between Ramallah 
municipality and others partners, including through 
the Joint Coordination Unit, the Joint Service Council 
for Waste Management, and the Emergency Council 
amongst others. This analysis will provide an assessment 
of the strengths, weaknesses, lessons learned and 
recommended strategies to improve the effectiveness, 
efficiency and impact of cross boundary working.    
2. Building on the recommendations of stage 1, develop a 
road map for improving regional collaboration that defines 
the function, scope, responsibilities and performance 
metrics for working with partners.   
3. Implement the road map and formalise working 
relationships in order to achieving better collaborations 
with other partners. Prioritise cross boundary projects 
and allocate appropriate human resources and capacity 
building required to support the new joint working 
relationships. 

Resilience Value
This is a cross-cutting opportunity for Ramallah and 
surrounding municipalities. Taking a regionally integrated 
approach can unlock economies of scale that increase 
resourcefulness and can result in more robust service 
delivery systems.

This forum will position Ramallah as a leader in Resilience 
thinking across Palestine, and help integrate resilience 
principles into the National Ministry of Local Government.
When planning the National Resilience Forum will draw on 
100RC’s experience in convening different stakeholders to 
build capacity around resilience.
Resilience Value
Builds knowledge and capacity around resilience and 
integrated disaster management, both within Ramallah 
and beyond. This will promote efforts to build community 
wellbeing and social cohesion, which are important assets 
for cities in good times and bad.

Ramallah Municipality regularly develops strategic and 
annual plans which, in order to be effective, require long 
term oversight as well as monitoring and evaluation of 
efforts. However, issues such as resource constraints, time 
pressures and a limited culture of strategic coordination 
make this difficult for municipal departments, which typically 
need to focus their efforts on dealing with immediate and 
short-term issues.
These existing challenges will be increased as Ramallah 
Municipality takes on a leading role in developing the 
resilience of our region. Effectively leading change, both 
within and outside the municipality, will require a rethink of 
our governance structure and organizational culture.
To bridge this critical gap, the municipality needs to develop 
its core functions in planning, management and leadership; 
implementing and monitoring resilience strategy actions; and 
mobilising, managing and guiding other external partners.
This will be advanced through the following activities:
•   Building on existing work to map organisational 
responsibilities and undertaking a comprehensive capacity 
analysis of the municipality, including roles, functions, 
decision making processes, workflows, feedback 
mechanisms, financial and human resources. This will 
be used to understand gaps that need to be filled to 
facilitate Ramallah Municipality leading the regional change 
management process for resilience.
•   Establishing a specific unit within Ramallah Municipality 
to support existing units, set strategic indicators, mobilize 
100RC Platform Partners and additional donors, and 
undertake overarching monitoring, coordination and 
annual reporting on municipal performance. It will also 
oversee implementation of the actions within the Resilient 
Ramallah 2050 Strategy, which will require liaison with 
stakeholders at the city, Governorate, National, private 
sector, academic and community levels. Additionally, it 
will undertake capacity building within the municipality 

around resilience principles, ensuring ongoing effective 
engagement with the 100RC network.
•   The action to establish an evidence-based performance 
system for the municipality will sit with this unit (see 
Action 15) in partnership with the Ramallah Municipality IT 
Department.
Resilience Value
Supports integration of resilience principles and 
coordination between municipal departments. This will 
improve resourcefulness by identifying interdependencies 
and opportunities for cross-cutting benefits. Annual public 
reporting can increase public awareness and trust in 
municipal activities. It can also reduce ‘burn out’ among staff.

While city decisions are made with the best of intentions, 
within Ramallah there is often a tendency towards decision-
making and planning based on “expert opinion”, rather than 
documented evidence. One of the drivers for this is a lack 
of any transparent system for tracking and reporting on 
the outcomes of municipal and city decision-making and 
investments - along with performance of its leaders and 
staff. This can lead to politicized decision-making, foster a 
sense of distrust in municipal activities, and result in missed 
opportunities to refine and improve decision-making based 
on past experiences.
This action will take a comprehensive inventory of data held 
by the city and develop a set of municipal performance 
indicators with urban resilience principles embedded. 
They will incorporate key principles from the City 
Resilience Framework and UN Sustainable Development 
Goals. Ramallah Municipality will seek to involve adjacent 
municipalities and share its work to promote accountability, 
transparency, evidence-based decision making, and positive 
competition within and between the cities.
The project will also expose the city to different models of 
leadership through partnership with other cities in the 100RC 
network.
Resilience Value
Promotes leadership and effective management through 
more transparent decision-making and local government 
accountability. This can increase community trust in, and 
engagement with, government activities.

Increasing the amount of engagement with the community 
(including marginalized groups) in decision-making about 
community assets is not a straightforward exercise. 
Ramallah, and Palestine more broadly, does not have a 
centuries-old tradition of democratic governance, meaning 
neither citizens or institutions are accustomed to two-way 
dialogue and participatory planning approaches. Achieving 
change in this area will be a long-term exercise in shifting 
cultural attitudes and expectations within communities, as 
well as modifying historic approaches and procedures in 
organisations like Ramallah Municipality.
Ramallah Municipality will establish a 10 year plan of action 
for greater community engagement in government decision-
making, initially at the municipal level. Using international 
frameworks such as the International Association for Public 
Participation (IAP2) spectrum, it will plan out the long-term 
objectives for increasing stakeholder participation, along 
with the mixture of approaches to be trialled in support of 
these objectives. Engagement mechanisms are expected to 
use a range of media, varying from surveys and social media, 
to public meetings, focus groups, television advertising and 
trials of participatory budgeting.
While this longer term plan is being established, we 
will commence with tangible initiatives to build greater 
stakeholder engagement and participation – see actions 17 
and 18 opposite.

Resilience Value
Improves social cohesion and empowers communities 
to participate in civic decision-making. Can also increase 
self-determination and reduce community reliance on the 
municipality and other organisations.

This action will establish a representative group of 
stakeholders from a range of sectors who will meet regularly 
to provide candid review of municipal projects, plans 
and developments occurring in the city. Drawing on the 
relationships established through the Resilient Ramallah 
working groups, this will not be a decision-making body, 
but will instead be used to embed resilience in the way the 
city makes its decisions moving forward. It will be a living 
resilience lens.
Resilience Value
This action will engage more stakeholders in municipality 
decision-making and funding decisions, resulting in greater 
engagement and sense of shared ownership. This can 
support service provision and asset delivery that better 
responds to end-user needs.

This action will promote an inclusive culture and citizen 
responsibility by electing committees of community 
members for different neighbourhoods in the city. Ramallah 
Municipality will partner with trusted NGOs to help promote 
committees and elect members through a transparent 
and fair selection procedure that incorporates a truly 
representative sample of from participating communities 
(including an equitable gender distribution).
Committees would become the reference body that interact 
with city officials and institutions on local issues. They 
will have clearly established mandates, obligations and 
responsibilities. A longer term aim is for these committees 
to lead development of community resilience plans, in which 
neighbourhoods will be able to collectively set their own 
priorities and allocate resources to manage hazards.

Resilience Value
Improves social cohesion and empowers communities to 
participate in civic decision making, as well as establishing 
trusted points of contact in local communities. Also 
builds an important sense of self-determination and can

Ramallah is exposed to a range of disaster hazards, from 
earthquakes to sudden snow storms. However, for each 
hazard, the potential exposure and vulnerability of our 
communities and infrastructure varies widely across the city.
This action will provide a comprehensive assessment of 
the spatial relationships between a range of major shocks 
and the vulnerability of different people to these events. 
For example, this will include the likely ground acceleration 
rates, areas of liquefaction and landslide zones associated 
with earthquakes, as well as vulnerable buildings at risk of 
collapse. This will be considered alongside demographic, 
economic and health data to better understand potential 
coping capacities of different communities. 
Understanding how risks are distributed spatially across the 
city will aid the broader integrated disaster management 
actions in this strategy and aligns with several of the 
Global Goals under the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction. The action can also inform scenario testing and 
planning for emergency events, as well as helping decision 
makers to identify and prioritize key sites for redevelopment.
Resilience Value
Will support more efficient and effective use of limited 
resources for risk mitigation and preparedness. It can also 
support better recovery planning and day-to-day provision 
of basic services.

•  Palestinian Red Crescent and other emergency response 
agencies

Ramallah Municipality will work with first response agencies 
to plan and run a series of regular inter-agency response 
and recovery scenario drills. These sessions will simulate 
relevant real life situations to help those in emergency 
management to understand their roles and responsibilities 
in the immediate response and longer term recovery. Events 
will cover different types of scenario, including earthquakes, 
blizzards, disease pandemics and civil unrest.
Planning of these events will learn from leading practices 
elsewhere in the world. This includes the 100RC cities of San 
Francisco and Wellington, both of which are recognized as 
leaders in emergency management and are at significant risk 
of a major seismic event. 
Resilience Value
These sessions will provide a safe space to practice for 
real life emergencies, ensuring improving effectiveness of 
response and recovery. They will also help identify mitigation 
and preparedness measures that can be implemented to 
reduce risk exposure. 

Ramallah Municipality will work with other municipalities in 
Ramallah-Al-Bireh Governorate to identify best practice 
and develop a programme on integrating disaster risk 
management into practices and business processes. 
The programme will be offered to major city businesses/
institutions with a role to play in disaster resilience. For 
example, following a disruptive event, banks have a role to 
play in keeping our financial systems active and hotels may 
be valuable as safe gathering places.
Resilience Value
While this will require an initial investment, in the longer term, 
building capacity within institutions to effectively manage 
their own risk exposure will save resources and reduce 
the potential for reliance on municipal assistance in the 
event major shock. It will also be a valuable opportunity to 
influence the National approach and agenda for disaster risk 
management.

The circumstances of Ramallah and its surrounding have 
required great adaptability and resilience from businesses 
and institutions, which are regularly subject to service 
disruptions. However, Ramallah’s many small-to-medium 
enterprises (SMEs) remain especially vulnerable and may 
find it difficult to recover from a major shock such as an 
earthquake or prolonged electricity outage.
This pilot project will increase the level of continuity planning 
support provided to Ramallah’s businesses and institutions. 
We will work with 10 organisations to help them produce 
simple but effective plans that consider their supply chain 
and establish contingency measures they can apply in 
the event of a shock. This will enable them to continue 
operating or to resume operations more quickly. There is the 
opportunity to scale up this pilot program in the future.
Resilience Value
This action helps keep critical services available and the 
economy functioning following shock events. Business 
continuity planning can also help businesses identify ways to 
improve their operations in good times.

Inspiration from Wellington – Business Continuity 
Planning
Wellington is located in one of the most seismically active locations in the world, so helping businesses plan for 
earthquakes is crucial to its resilience.
Realising that most small businesses don’t have the time or resources to do detailed business continuity planning, 
Wellington Region Emergency Management Office (WREMO) has developed and delivered quick and simple two hour 
workshops that can rapidly advance levels of flexibility and adaptability when a disruptive event does strike. 
Resilient Ramallah will learn from Wellington as we implement Action 22. You can learn more about Wellington’s 
approach at http://www.getprepared.org.nz/businesses.

Ramallah, and Palestine more broadly, is making good strides 
in emergency response. The Municipality has established a 
disaster response center and supporting procedures, but 
more needs to be done to provide early warning of impending 
shocks.
This action will develop and implement a warning system 
covering both predictable and more unpredictable disaster 
events, with the aim of reaching the largest number of people 
possible. A major challenge for this will be how to effectively 
warn the large number of people not registered in the city, 
but who may be present during the daytime. It will therefore 
be important for this work to link with Action 6, which 
aims to better define and understand Ramallah’s transient 
population.
This action supports Global Goal 7 of the Sendai Framework 
for Disaster Risk Reduction: “Substantially increase the 
availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning 
systems and disaster risk information and assessments to 
people by 2030.”
Resilience Value
This action will provide clear communication that allows 
affected residents to respond effectively to a shock event. It 
can also reduce response times for emergency services and 
enable protective measures for buildings and infrastructure 
to be put into place. This will support continuity of critical 
services, quicker recovery and provide greater confidence to 
potential investors.

travelling long distances through Israeli checkpoints, 
to unpredictable disruptions in critical services – can 
be exhausting and disempowering. In this context, 
as Ramallites, we sometimes lose sight of the 
tremendous potential of our city and its people.
The actions in this section acknowledge our people 
and culture as Ramallah’s strongest assets. Our 
cultural assets and institutions bind us together and 
provide major opportunities for sustainable economic 
growth through carefully-managed tourism. Our 
local educational institutions are leaders in Palestine, 
but we can do more to draw on their expertise to 
support Ramallah’s resilience, as well as support 
our economy by linking their activities better with 
the needs of local industries. We are fortunate to 

have a very young population in Ramallah and at the 
national level – this ‘youth bulge’, as we call it, presents 
a major opportunity for rapid economic and social 
development.
Realising potential also means helping our 
communities to understand the risks they face, 
along with how they can support themselves and 
one another. Raising awareness will only partly 
address this – as a city we must also provide fair and 
equitable access to the resources people need, not 
only to support themselves, but to truly prosper. 
Actions in this section focus on ensuring access 
to spaces and technologies that enable different 
types of connection and collaboration – from safe 
and inclusive public gathering spaces, to reliable 
telecommunications infrastructure that helps people 
connect online.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20509594Resilient Ramallah 205094Resilient Ramallah 205095Economic projections developed by AECOM predict that 
over the next 20 years an additional 76,000 new jobs will 
be required just to keep unemployment at the current 
rate – 7.9% across the three cities and 17.7% across the 
Governorate. 
In 2014, the unemployment rate among new graduates 
across the West Bank between 20 and 29 years that hold 
associate diploma certificates or higher was 42.3%. This 
partly reflects a mismatch of skills required by local industries 
and those being generated by the education sector, which 
is somewhat driven by a weak culture around student job 
placements, internships and residency programs. Moreover, 
vocational courses are often gendered and not available for 
girls. This is exacerbated by social norms and expectations 
about what is an appropriate profession for a woman, outright 
excluding women from a number of professions.
As a major center for university education in Palestine, 
Ramallah has a major role to play in addressing these 
challenges. This will happen through multiple approaches:
•  Market analysis of future jobs and skills needed in different 
employment categories, as well as alignment with market 
needs
•   Evaluating the scientific and technical capacity of higher 
education to deliver the desired competencies and skills
•   Designing student work experience and residency 
programs for local university students, enabling direct 
collaboration between universities and major employers 
within Ramallah and its surroundings. The program will be 
supported by ongoing mentoring following graduation, 
along with a concerted emphasis on gender equity in 
employment. Ramallah municipality can coordinate such 
collaborations through its partnership with the different 
sectors in the city, with support from Ministries of Finance, 
Economic Development and Labour. We will coordinate 
with the World Bank, which is leading a similar project.

Resilience Value
Supports livelihoods and employment by better matching 
graduates’ skills with industry needs. This will support 
economic development, help retain locally educated 
talent, unlock fresh thinking and innovation, and build 
more meaningful collaborations between the business and 
academic sectors.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 20509796ACTION 24: Link higher education with the private sectorResilient Ramallah 205097PP

In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic breakthrough 
in Ramallah’s private sector economy. However, levels of 
investment are beginning to stagnate and the number of 
university graduates exceeds job opportunities. Start-up 
businesses are an important part of the solution to these 
challenges – since 2014, over 600 jobs were created by start-
ups in Ramallah. Today, they account for 34% of the total 
employment of the ICT sector.
We will further support start-ups by establishing Ramallah 
TechPark, which will be revolutionary in Palestine. The 
TechPark will allow young professionals – especially 
university graduates from the IT and Business departments 
– to come together with investors and experts to create 
new business models and technical solutions to challenges 
facing Ramallah, Palestine and the region more broadly.
Ramallah Municipality has identified a planned appropriate 
space for the project, which will be delivered in partnership 
with the Leaders Organization. The TechPark is an 
important step to branding Ramallah as an innovation and 
entrepreneurship city that inspires future generations of 
entrepreneurs in Palestine.

Resilience Value
Supports innovation and entrepreneurship to improve 
employment outcomes and generate investment in the 
region’s economy. The action can also improve gender 
equity – while women account for 16% of the Ramallah labour 
force, the participation rate is 31% in start-ups.

With good proximity to the globally important historic sites at 
Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and a vibrant social and cultural 
scene with strong hospitality assets, tourism is a key growth 
sector in Ramallah. The discovery of Khirbet el Tireh – an 
ancient site of religious significance within a few kilometres 
of Ramallah – also has great potential to increase levels of 
religious tourism in our city.
Linking with the Municipal Tourism Strategy that was recently 
developed, this project seeks to establish a long-term vision 
for tourism that is coordinated with, and actively supported 
by, efforts at the Governorate and National levels. The 
approach needs to include consistent external messaging; 
areas for priority development; potential risks; and future 
skills/infrastructure needs. It will also consider how tourism 
including cultural industry can provide critical support in 
times of emergency through the use of their facilities and 
resources (e.g. spare rooms, bilingual staff).

Resilience Value
This action can support economic growth and local 
jobs while helping to minimize the unintended adverse 
consequences that can come from rapid development of 
tourism in a city. It will also support improved emergency 
response through innovative use of existing resources in 
Ramallah.

Local efforts to build resilience – ‘FastForward 
Accelerator’
Developed by the Leaders Organisation, FastForward is Palestine’s first start-up accelerator. Since its establishment 
in 2013, FastForward has supported twelve companies to grow from idea to business. Over a period of four months, 
the program provides motivated start-ups with seed funding of US$20,000, along with office space and technology, 
access to highly experienced mentors, one-on-one sessions with experts from professional sectors, and relevant 
training courses.

Many Ramallah residents are not fully aware of their rights 
to access to public space. Additionally, constraints on 
Palestinian-controlled land mean there is limited spare 
public land available for municipal parks and meeting places. 
However, Ramallah does have significant tracts of vacant, 
privately-owned space.
This action will identify locations within Ramallah that have 
the highest potential as public gathering and creative 
spaces. Considering both municipal and disused private 
land, it will determine opportunities for land to be provided 
to community groups to use spaces –  either on a temporary 
or longer-term basis – for a range of activities such as  arts 
and crafts villages or pocket parks. Ramallah Municipality 
will support participating community groups by negotiating 
with private landholders and simplifying any permitting or 
approvals processes. 
In addition to vacant land, the project will look at options 
for underused assets and spaces (e.g. walls, water tanks, 
theatres) that can be used for installations such as murals, 
sculptures and performance pieces. Installations that 
support messages of acceptance and resilience will be 
prioritized.
Resilience Value
This action will improve community facilities and increase 
natural capital in the city. By giving community groups an 
opportunity to develop these spaces, it will also build pride, 
community cohesion and awareness of civil rights. 

Collaborating with Pittsburgh – creating spaces for 
people
When developing its resilience strategy, Pittsburgh in the USA realised that its tracts of vacant and underused land 
present a major opportunity to generate valuable community assets. Pittsburgh is currently implementing a program 
to repurpose some of this land to provide space for uses like recreation, urban agriculture, stormwater capture and 
public are.
As we implement Action 27 in this strategy, we will share knowledge and experiences with Pittsburgh, along with other 
cities in the network that are pursuing similar approaches.

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 2050103102ACTION 27: Provide community groups with vacant or underused space or assets where they can shape new gathering and creative spacesPP

Until 2004, Palestine lacked insurance law and hence the 
industry was highly disorganized. The industry has since 
begun to grow due to the establishment of an insurance 
regulator – the Palestine Capital Market Authority (PCMA) 
– and the enactment of the Insurance Law 2005. Despite 
this, levels of public awareness and uptake of small business 
and general insurance (e.g. home, contents and car) policies 
remain low. This leaves many Ramallah residents at risk of 
being unable to resume a comparable quality of life following 
a disruptive event, and can also have significant negative 
effects on economic activity.

Ramallah Municipality will collaborate with insurance 
companies to raise awareness about the benefits of 
insurance and reduce the barriers to general insurance 
uptake among Ramallah businesses, individuals and 
institutions. This will take inspiration from successful 
international models, where effective products have 
been developed to respond to the needs of uninsured 
or underinsured people. This will include looking for 
mechanisms to recognize the benefit of prevention, 
mitigation and adaptation measures within insurance policy, 
such as resilience bonds.

Resilience Value
Before a disaster strikes, insurance pricing gives policy 
holders incentives to reduce their exposures through risk 
mitigation measures. In the aftermath, insurance transfers 
the fiscal burden away from taxpayers, onto the private 
sector and into international capital markets. Developing 
products through partnerships and informed by meaningful 
stakeholder input can maximize uptake and resilience 
benefits.

Inspiration from Melbourne – Innovative Insurance
Despite being a wealthy country, there are many Australian adults who are unable to afford conventional insurance for 
their home, contents and care, or the level of cover available is too high for their need.
In response, Good Shepherd Microfinance collaborated with the insurance firm Suncorp to design an innovative 
insurance scheme that provides basic, affordable and accessible home and contents and car insurance to low-income 
people. The product is based on direct consultation with the target market to understand their needs – this helped 
Suncorp tailor the product and ensure that users did not have to pay more for a level of cover they don’t need.
Interestingly, it was found that basic car insurance was critical to resilience of many low-income people. This is 
because low-income communities often had poor access to public transport, so losing their car would make it difficult 
for them to access employment and services.

Research for the Bank of International Settlements has found that high levels of insurance penetration can help cities 
achieve long-term GDP growth after a major shock event.

•   Developing a more effective monitoring system with 
adequate and well-trained inspectors, reporting system 
for registering new cases, and smart electronic monitoring 
of incidents, along with follow-up on corrective and 
preventative actions. This system will be developed by 
Ramallah Municipality with the collaboration of relevant 
stakeholders.
Resilience Value
This action supports improved public health outcomes 
and reduced environmental degradation. It can create new 
employment in the field of OHS management and improve 
Ramallah’s reputation internationally, making it a more 
attractive place for investment and supporting sustainable 
economic growth.

The construction sector has grown steadily in Ramallah, 
but this has occurred without matching improvement in 
licensing and occupational health and safety regulation. 
The result has been a high rate of incidents, most of which 
go undocumented due to the lack of a formal reporting 
and investigation system run by the National Government, 
Ramallah Municipality or Union of Palestinian Workers. These 
incidents range from minor injuries and chemical spills, 
through to large pollution events and occasional deaths. 
Some residents of Ramallah and its surroundings also take 
employment in construction projects in Israel, where injuries 
are common and deaths have been known to occur.
While the Ministry of Labour is mandated to monitor 
compliance with labour laws by contractors, at present 
there is a lack of resourcing. In an attempt to play a greater 
role in enforcement, Ramallah Municipality has developed 
new licensing procedure and supporting guidelines for 
construction firms.  
This action will build on these licensing and guidelines in 
several ways:
•  A review of safety and health guidelines for construction 
workers in the city, drawing on other cities’ experiences 
of enforcing workers’ safety, both within our region (e.g. 
Amman) and elsewhere
•   An increased focus from the Municipality on agreements, 
licensing and education around safe work practices
•   Mandating construction companies operating in the city to 
insure workers against potential risks and dangers
•   Partnership between Ministry of Labour and Ramallah 
Municipality to more efficiently enforce labour law and 
practices
•   Awareness and education of contractors and workers on 
their legal rights and responsibilities, led by public safety 
committee at the Ramallah-Al-Bireh Governorate level

This action involves preparing physical and online resources 
for new residents to encourage them to become productive 
and engaged members of the community. This is expected 
to include welcome information packs, assistance 
registering with necessary agencies and services, 
emergency management information, and community group 
information packs. A foundational step of this process will 
be collaborating with the holders of demographic data to 
understand who is new to the city and could benefit from this 
assistance.
Resilience Value
Increases community understanding of available resources, 
disaster management processes and potential hazards 
within the city. Supports communities in managing issues 
themselves and helps improve social cohesion and 
community engagement with the municipality.

Integrated Cultural Strategy. It will create a clear vision for 
promoting and supporting culture within the city and provide 
a framework to support the city’s organisations to integrate 
cultural considerations into their work.
This will be supported by practical materials that support 
government and non-government institutions working in the 
city to apply a cultural lens to their programs and projects. 
Examples of initiatives could include cultural awareness 
training modules, a calendar events, awards that recognise 
contributions to culture and awareness as well as guidance 
on incorporating cultural awareness into policy development.  
The action takes inspiration from ‘Health in All Policies’ 
approaches applied in countries such as the United Kingdom, 
with the focus here instead on promoting local culture. 
It is linked with Action 32, which focuses on how cultural 
awareness can be improved among school students.

Resilience Value
This action takes an integrated approach to building more 
cohesive and culturally aware city. It uses the notion of 
shared history and culture to build cohesion and resilience in 
the face of dislocation and constraints on freedom.
Delivery lead
Ramallah Municipality
Partners
•  Local partners

This action will see Ramallah Municipality partner with 
local schools to pilot greater integration of local cultural 
awareness into the formal curriculum. This will include 
excursions and a scheme where school students will play a 
hands-on role in management and promotion of a specific 
heritage or cultural asset (e.g. helping to curate an exhibit at a 
museum). Outcomes will be monitored by a partner from the 
higher education sector.
A private school has been chosen for the pilot as it has more 
autonomy to experiment with curriculum. If this pilot can 
demonstrate successful outcomes, in the longer term there 
is an opportunity for this program to influence the broader 
national curriculum.

Resilience Value
The action provides opportunities for the young people to 
actively engage with Ramallah’s cultural assets, helping to 
build a more cohesive Ramallites and Palestinian identity. It 
also unlocks additional resources to manage and promote 
the city’s cultural assets to other citizens.

School students in Ramallah and surrounding areas already 
undertake a range of extra-curricular activities, such as 
excursions and volunteering. There is an opportunity to 
better integrate active learning opportunities around good 
citizenship into these activities.
Partnering with NGOs working with youth, this action 
will develop targeted activities that aim to embed 
an understanding of key legal processes, rights and 
responsibilities within the daily lives of younger citizens. 
The action will build on the efforts of the existing City Youth 
Council, which to date has been limited to a small subset of 
young Ramallites.
Resilience Value
Building levels of civic awareness among the youth is 
extremely important for the future resilience of Ramallah, 
especially given the still fledgling nature of State of Palestine. 
This can create a future generation of leaders, as well as 
active participants in Ramallah and Palestinian society and 
the economy.

Collaborating with Byblos – protecting and honoring 
cultural assets
Byblos in Lebanon is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, and as such it has a rich and complex 
history and mix of cultural assets. Much like Ramallah, Byblos identified in its resilience strategy that protection and 
celebration of culture can be an important catalyst for economic development, community engagement, participation 
and social cohesion.
We can learn a great deal from Byblos as we seek to document and celebrate culture and heritage in Ramallah. They 
are implementing a range of practical actions in this area, such as developing restoration guidelines for preserving and 
enhancing physical assets in their Old City, and empowering community members to practice traditional crafts and 
expand the market for artisanal products.
Our two cities will collaborate regularly over coming years, sharing experiences and lessons learned. 

Resilient Ramallah 2050Resilient Ramallah 2050113112ACTION 31: Integrate cultural awareness into organisational practicesACTION 32: Integrate cultural awareness into the educational curriculumACTION 33: Incorporate activities promoting good citizenship into extra-curricular programs for studentsGOAL 11
Invest in smart city approaches that 
support community resilience.

Achieving the objectives and delivering many of the actions 
will need to be supported by an efficient, fast and reliable 
communications network. While Palestine has recently 
been granted Israeli permission to establish 3G mobile 
coverage, we want to provide our residents with multiple 
communications options and ensure there is redundancy 
built into our systems.
In the first instance this action is about partnering with 
telecommunications providers to expand the current free 
city Wi-Fi network to reach more residents and businesses. 
In parallel, this will involve installation of high-speed fibre in all 
areas of new development, along with rolling out the new 3G 
network.
Resilience Value
Provides more reliable communication, access to 
information, and efficient delivery of a range of services (e.g. 
health care, municipal services). This will support economic 
prosperity, engagement between community members, and 
effective communication in times of shock.

The Ramallah Smart City Project aims to enhance 
communication with the local community, improve remote 
service delivery, provide information to the public on 
activities and public events in the municipality, and gather 
feedback on service delivery. It also provides tools for 
remote data gathering.
This action will build on Ramallah Smart City to extend the 
types of assets and services included in the platform. It will 
include mapping and promotion of cultural assets, crowd-
sourced data gathering around usage patterns for public 
spaces, and a social platform where users can communicate 
experiences of the city’s assets with one another.

Resilience Value
This action can improve community engagement, awareness 
and accessibility of the city’s assets. It can also enable 
innovative use of resources, including community-led action 
in a range of areas that support resilience.

A long-term aim for Ramallah is to take an integrated 
approach to critical infrastructure development that 
looks at the whole system, rather than individual utilities. 
We are a long way from this at present, but will work 
towards an approach where needs for Transport, Energy, 
Telecommunications and other critical services are looked at 
holistically.
This is an initial step towards this future. It will establish 
a formal, trusted forum where critical infrastructure 
providers for Ramallah and its surroundings can come 
together to share information and collaborate around 
critical infrastructure interdependencies, vulnerabilities 
and opportunities for efficiencies (e.g. through co-locating 
infrastructure).
The action will draw on existing mapping work done as part 
of the Ramallah Smart City project, and establish clear 
information sharing protocols to ensure security of sensitive 
data. In this area there are opportunities to learn from other 
cities in the 100RC network, such as Rotterdam. If successful 
within Ramallah-Al-Bireh Governorate, the program could be 
rolled out on a National scale.

Resilience Value
More information sharing can help Ramallah make more 
of its limited resources, while also identifying system 
vulnerabilities, such as lack of redundancy or ‘cascading 
consequences’, where a failure in one system has flow-on 
effects for others.

Inspiration from Rotterdam – Cooperation between

The Rotterdam Resilient City strategy identified that while Rotterdam municipality plays an important role in managing 
critical infrastructure, there are multiple network providers which operate independently of each other. They 
identified a need for greater organisation and cooperation, especially in times of emergency when a disruption to 
one type of critical infrastructure can have cascading impacts across infrastructure networks. In response, they are 
currently working to incorporate resilience into their regional infrastructure agenda, and to develop platforms where 
infrastructure and utility providers can safely share information for mutual benefit.

Implementation
Now we have developed the Resilient Ramallah Strategy, the 
real work can start! As noted in Action 13 in this Strategy, we 
will establish a specific unit within Ramallah Municipality to 
oversee implementation of Resilient Ramallah Strategy. This 
unit will lead the following actions:
•   Develop detailed Implementation Plans for our 37 actions 
in cooperation with the municipal management team. This 
will be supported by an overarching Annual Plan.
•   Work to embed resilience principles and build 
capacity within Ramallah Municipality and other key 
institutions throughout our city – this is an important 
acknowledgement that truly enduring change for resilience 
will only come if it is embraced and owned throughout our 
city - not just within one municipal unit. 
•   Ensure fruitful and effective ongoing relationships with 
100RC, other cities in the network, and Ramallah’s other 
‘twin cities’.
•   Mobilize additional resources and support for resilience-
building through national and international sources, 
including 100RC’s Platform Partners.
•   Promote leading activities that support the resilience of 
Ramallah and its surroundings.
•   Coach different municipality departments and units in 
developing their annual plans in an integrated way
The table on page 122 summarizes all the actions 
documented in this strategy, including action leads, partner 
agencies and delivery timeframes. It also documents any 
alignment the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the 
Global Targets established under the Sendai Framework for 
Disaster Risk Reduction.
Additionally, the Action Implementation Summary includes 
two levels of implementation target – one indicates what 
we want to have achieved during Year 1, while the other 
provides the desired impact of each action once it has been 
implemented fully. These preliminary targets may be refined 
by developing the detailed Implementation Plan with long 
term, medium term and short term actions highlighted.

Monitoring and reporting on 
our progress
A crucial quality of resilient systems is reflectiveness – 
ensuring that we learn from past experiences and use them 
to inform future decisions. Resilient Ramallah will be a truly 
reflective strategy by monitoring our performance in a 
number of ways:
•  We will track progress against the implementation plans 
for each action, informed by the targets set out in the 
Action Implementation Summary. Acknowledging that 
cities rapidly evolve, in some cases we may identify that 
an action is not having the outcome we expected at the 
outset, or that the need for the action has changed. In 
these cases we will be adaptive, evolving actions where 
necessary in consultation with our local experts, partners 
and the Municipality.
•   Monitor the collective progress of actions in this strategy 
to increase Ramallah’s resilience. While data availability is 
a challenge, a longer term aim will be to report fully against 
a tested and recognized global framework for measuring 
urban resilience. In the interim, we will develop a concise 
and manageable set of city resilience indicators that suits 
the Ramallah context. These will be adapted from existing 
approaches, such as the City Resilience Framework, 
UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the Sendai 
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. 
In keeping with Actions 13 and 15 of this Strategy, we 
will report to the public annually on progress against this 
Strategy. We see this as a positive example that can catalyse 
greater public accountability among other institutions in 
Palestine.

Vision

Tangible and implementable project, program or activity designed to build Ramallah’s 
resilience and contribute to achieving the strategy’s vision and supports a specific goal
Comprising four dimensions and 12 drivers that together illustrate what makes a city 
resilient, the CRF is used by cities in the 100RC network to help them understand the 
complex and overlapping systems that contribute to their resilience. 
Advisor that reports directly to the city mayor. Their task is to establish a compelling 
resilience vision for his or her city, working across departments and with the local community 
to maximize innovation and minimize the impact of unforeseen events.
Applying across a range of sectors or resilience issues. For example, investment in one area 
(e.g. sustainable transport) that can also have cross-cutting, or flow-on, effects in other 
areas (e.g. improved air quality, social cohesion).
People of Palestinian origin currently living away from Palestine
Important areas or issues to investigate during Phase II of the resilience strategy 
development process
A specific part of the 100RC strategy development process where cities prioritize and refine 
actions to maximize resilience benefits
A document that establishes an initial, qualitative understanding of the city’s strengths and 
weaknesses against the City Resilience Framework
The severity and likelihood of a shock or stress occurring
A sudden event that threatens a city, such as an earthquake, flood or snowstorm
An priority area where Ramallah needs to take action to improve its resilience
A longer-term problem that weakens the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis
Overarching aim for a Resilient Ramallah in the year 2050 that guides this strategy
