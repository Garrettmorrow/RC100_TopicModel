FOREWORD BY 
THE MAYOR OF DAKAR

Dakar, the first African city to join 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The 
Rockefeller Foundation alongside Durban, has put in place a
framework to develop its urban resilience strategy. This framework came
to life through the “Resilient Dakar” program coordinated by my
Chief Resilience Officer (CRO). 

Anchored around an inclusive approach and integrating a diversity
of functions, the strategy drafting process has mobilized the city’s
stakeholders, sparking participation and developing
dynamic actions aimed at articulating the various resilience
objectives. The strategy has also enabled an integrated approach
to address the multiple risks and challenges that can affect a city.

Khalifa Ababacar Sall
Mayor of the city of Dakar

Thanks to the support of the city’s stakeholders, especially the members
of the steering committee who I would like to thank for their contribution,
the city of Dakar was able to develop an urban resilience strategy which, 
in addition to consolidating the diagnostic and identifying actions to be 

11

taken, seeks to restore the territory’s structural stability and to develop urban functions in the context of 
a city currently characterized by inadequately controlled urbanization.

With strategy development complete, additional efforts are required to initiate and achieve the actions
identified for sustainable urban management. The implementation of the resilience strategy sets the city 
into an exercise in both operational and prospective dimensions to enable the city to not only anticipate 
and resist shocks, risks, and constraints, but to act on the socio-economic dimension in order to improve 
the living conditions of its citizens.

We can realize these efforts thanks to our sheer will, the combined efforts of all public authorities, the 
enthusiastic participation of citizens, and with the support of our partners including 100 Resilient Cities 
- Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, and its president Michael Berkowitz to whom I express my 
congratulations for putting forth such an unprecedented initiative. I would like to renew our sincere 
gratitude for the support of 100 Resilient Cities in developing the present urban resilience strategy. 
I would also like to reaffirm the interest of the city of Dakar in the 100 Resilient Cities network - the 
platform for exchange of best practices among cities - and to express our availability to pursue further 
partnership, namely by receiving its technical assistance to ensure the successful implementation of the 
first urban resilience strategy in Africa.

NOTE FROM THE 
CHIEF RESILIENCE 
OFFICER

I was motivated to become Dakar’s Chief Resilience Officer 
(CRO) given the position’s potential impact on the lives of 
Dakarois. And upon notification of the city of Dakar’s acceptance 
to the 100 Resilient Cities network, I accepted Mayor Sall’s 
invitation to launch Dakar’s resilience journey. 

In my role as the CRO for Dakar, I have worked with a broad 
group of stakeholders to:

01
02

03

Create a compelling vision of resilience within the city,

Generate excitement and facilitate the resilience 
discussion across a diversity of sectors and actors, and

Ensure active and inclusive public participation 
throughout the whole process. 

Assembling the pieces that form Dakar’s present strategy has not 
always been an easy task. All those who took part in this exercise 
have been pushed to tackle and resolve various challenges and 
concerns which we had, in order to effectively and efficiently 
complete our work. Through this process, the entire team 
acquired a valuable understanding that in order for Dakar’s 
Resilience Strategy to be successful, it had to acknowledge and 
be built around the complex and interconnected challenges 
that the city faces. This will position the city to best identify 
downstream impact, and create appropriate solutions. 

I thank Mayor Sall for the opportunity to serve the City of Dakar 
through this process in my capacity as CRO. I am also thankful 
to Dalberg Global Development Advisors, and the staff and 
leadership of 100 Resilient Cities and Dakar’s Resilience Steering 
Committee. Individually and collectively, these teams have made 
it possible to address Dakar’s resilience challenges in a holistic 
and integrated way, leveraging innovation to address our city’s 
emerging and chronic challenges of rapid urbanization. 

Dakar’s Resilience Strategy will prepare the city for a shared 
vision towards a stronger, more resilient city that is able to adapt 
to the demands of the 21st century and beyond. It will foster a 
shared confidence between all actors to better define problems, 
inform policies and utilize tools to prioritize, make informed 
choices, and plan for the future. 

I am immensely excited about my contribution towards launching 
Dakar’s Resilience Strategy and the work of my team. I very 
much look forward to carrying forward the implementation of 
the Strategy’s many critical initiatives.

LETTER FROM
100 RESILIENT 
CITIES 

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, it is my honor 
to congratulate the city of Dakar on the release of Africa’s first 
resilience strategy. The work outlined within the strategy takes 
a bold approach toward confronting Dakar’s current and future 
shocks and stresses.  The strategy provides a roadmap towards 
a city that is clean, safe, energy efficient, and poised for inclusive 
growth. This reflects exactly the type of holistic urban resilience 
approach that 100RC seeks to spread far beyond our network of 
member cities. 

The support and leadership of Dakar’s Resilience Steering 
Committee – spanning a diversity of representatives, from 
academia, public, and private sectors – was critical to the 
development of this document, and we thank them for their 
commitment to the strategy process. Of course, this strategy 
would not have been possible without the dedication of Dakar’s 
Chief Resilience Officer, Mr. Antoine Faye, and the tireless efforts 
of his team. 

While the release of this strategy represents an important 
milestone in the pursuit of a more resilient Dakar, we know that 
our work is far from over. Building urban resilience is a multi-
generational effort that will take continued commitment and 
action to ensure positive impact. We know that our success will 
not be measured by how well we plan for our future challenges, 
but rather how we implement the projects that will make the city 
as a whole stronger in the face of those challenges, no matter 
what form they may take. 

For this reason, we are so excited to continue our partnership 
into the implementation phase, transforming the innovative 
projects presented within into reality. This body of work will 
positively impact the lives of all who reside in Dakar, both when 
disaster strikes and during times in-between. 

These projects will also serve as a valuable best practice for the 
rest of the 100RC Network to learn from and emulate. As one of 
the African cities selected in the first round of the 100 Resilient 
Cities Challenge, Dakar has time and again been a pioneer in our 
global movement.  We could not be more excited to continue 
to partner with Dakar as this city helps to spread the urban 
resilience revolution to cities across the region, and the world.  

Congratulations again on this important achievement, and we 
look forward to the shared journey ahead.  

Yours Faithfully,
 

Michael Berkowitz

President, 100 Resilient Cities

DAKAR: A CITY OF CHALLENGES 
AND OPPORTUNITIES

Dakar, Senegal’s capital city, benefits from a strategic 
position as the western-most part of the African 
continent – it is at a junction point between Africa, 
Europe, and the Americas. Dakar is also an important 
metropolitan center for Senegal as well as the West 
African region as a whole. 

Dakar is the 5th most populated city in West Africa, with 
a population estimated at 3.3 million in 2015.1 Sustained 
urban migration since the 1970s, along with a population 
growth rate of 2.6%2, contribute to the rapidly increasing 
population of Dakar. These trends have translated into a 
high urbanization rate of 4% on average between 2010 
and 2015.3 At this pace, Dakar’s population will double by 
2025.

Dakar is facing many shocks and stresses that come with 
rapid urbanization, which are seriously outstripping its 
capacity to provide adequate services and quality living 
conditions to its citizens. Five areas have been identified 
as critical levers to reinforcing Dakar’s resilience 
following a review process with the city’s stakeholders. 
The perceptions gathered from these stakeholders 
and developed after a risk and asset analysis, were the 
basis of the selection process for the top five discovery 
areas. These discovery areas also have the potential to 
highly impact the city’s social and economic resilience: 
(i) civic engagement, (ii) climate change readiness, (iii) 
sanitation, and (iv) energy efficiency. Urban mobility, 
which is as critical, will be addressed later due to 
capacity. Main challenges in each of these discovery 
areas are described below. 

CIVIC ENGAGEMENT

The recurrence and persistence of risks facing the 
city is strongly linked to the behavior and attitudes 
of its citizens. Weak civic engagement, inconsistent 
construction practices, poor waste disposal behaviors, 
misuse of roads, poor hygiene, and environmental 
degradation are all stresses caused by citizens’ 
behaviors. The inability to control and correct such 
behaviors and attitudes can have massive repercussions 
or can become important shocks for the city (fires, 
epidemics, infrastructure disrepair, violence, etc.).

Climate change also presents a considerable challenge 
to the city. Rising sea levels are a threat to Dakar’s 
coastlines and several other coastal West African 
countries. The resulting coastal erosion not only 
threatens the city’s beaches which have an important 
touristic appeal, but also threatens to displace 12 of the 
city’s 19 communes by the Atlantic sea front. Coastal 
erosion also affects infrastructure such as the harbor, 
and other industrial plants along the coast such as the 
Cap des Biches power plant which is located one meter 
below sea level and has suffered floods caused by strong 
seasonal swells. Climate change is represented as a 
cross-cutting challenge throughout the identified focus 
areas.

The city’s waste water drainage infrastructure is 
constantly put to the test, especially in neighborhoods 
that were built on old shallows that have long been 
dried by years of drought. Furthermore, inconsistent 
construction standards have rendered the network of 
rainwater flow vulnerable. Waste disposal systems have 
also become obsolete – waste collection services reach 
only 39%4 of the population for solid waste, and between 
10 to 30%5 for liquid waste. This waste is often disposed 
of in the open - in streams, the ocean, or dumps, 
without prior treatment.6 With the return of heavy 
rains, floods have been recurrent for the past few years, 
leaving citizens in vulnerable neighborhoods exposed 
to dangerous pathogens. In a region where diseases 
such as cholera and malaria are rampant, the amplitude 
of this public health hazard can have far reaching 
consequences. 

Dakar also incurs the costs of limited supply of 
energy and frequent power. These lead to a loss of 
one percentage point in the city’s GDP every year.7  
Furthermore, Dakar consumes 56.9% of the national 
energy supply (about 1.3 TWh in 2013) and will need 
an additional supply of 50MW to meet its current 
demand.8 The majority of this electricity is produced 
by power stations built between the 1960s and 1980s, 
with a higher production cost (170 CFAF/kWh) than its 
market value (118 CFAF/kWh).9 Electricity production 
in Senegal is dependent on fossil fuels, which is one of 
the most expensive sources of energy and the likely 
driver of production costs. Thus, the final cost of energy 
to Senegalese consumers is one of the highest in West 
Africa.10 Moreover, the demand in electricity will rise 
two-fold between 2013 and 203011 due to inefficient 
consumer practices such as the use of incandescent 
lamps accounting for about 70% of Dakar’s lighting, and 
consuming more than five times more electricity than a 
LED lamp, or the use of air conditioning without inverters 
which don’t optimize for temperature changes.12

TRANSPORTATION

The public transport service is inadequate and is 
deteriorating from year-to-year. It is difficult to move 
in Dakar by public or private transport, either because 
of the congestion encountered on the main roads, 
especially in the central city area, or the poor quality 
of service. More than 100,000 vehicles enter and exit 
Dakar every day on a congested, double-lane road13, as 
up to 80%14 of economic activities are concentrated in 
the capital city. Since 2000, conventional bus services 
are operated by Dakar Dem Dikk (DDD), but capacity 
provided by DDD is very low (few vehicles are operated 
daily), resulting in low and irregular frequencies. In 
response to the low capacity to meet public demand, 
smaller buses, known as “cars rapides”, with between 
25 and 40 seats,  arose with 2,500 to 4,000 buses 
operating in the city.15 The majority of cars rapides are 
concentrated on the routes from the periphery to Dakar 
center. The quality of service is judged as bad by many 
users/observers. In particular, the service provided 
by the cars rapides is usually characterized by old 
and polluting vehicles, bad maintenance, poor safety 
standards, drivers stopping anywhere on the street to 
pick up passengers, intimidation by controllers, the 
practice of cutting routes, obliging users to pay two or 
three times the fare for one trip, poor route information, 
long waiting times, and vehicles turning short of their 
stated destinations. The government plans to phase 

out these vehicles by 201816 and replace them with new 
buses that will improve safety, comfort, accessibility, 
while also being much more environmentally-friendly.

Consequently, the development of a resilience 
strategy aims to build the city of Dakar’s capacity 
and preparedness to address these challenges. It is 
furthermore evident that without the full participation 
of the city’s inhabitants, even the most promising 
projects will likely fail. In the resilience strategy, we will 
thus begin by implementing targeted awareness raising 
activities in order to solidify efforts to find the best 
possible solutions for the urban resilience of the city. 
While not an exhaustive approach to resolving each 
of Dakar’s identified challenges, the current resilience 
strategy provides details on prioritizing and addressing 
the challenges in a manner poised to yield near term 
resilience dividends. 

We have the ambition to transform Dakar’s current 
challenges into opportunities. We envision to empower 
citizens advocating for the active engagement of their 
counterparts in the private and public spheres (local 
and national government) to make Dakar a city THAT IS 
CLEAN, SAFE, ENERGY EFFICIENT AND POISED FOR 
INCLUSIVE GROWTH to sustain any future shocks or 
stresses.

VISION: 
A RESILIENT DAKAR 

By joining 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The 
Rockefeller Foundation, Dakar hopes to accelerate 
its evolution to become a model African city, which 
will have successfully aligned its rich heritage to 
opportunities that the 21st century offers. Dakar is 
also a microcosm of the challenges that a majority of 
African cities experience, and could serve as a sandbox 
for local solutions to challenges posed by rapid and 
complex urbanization. Dakar thus foresees becoming a 
flexible and evolving city that adapts to be more robust, 

capable, and equipped to recover from socio-economic 
as well as climatic and environmental stresses. 

The urban resilience strategy of Dakar offers possible 
opportunities for a sustainable city which will be able to 
respond to a catastrophe by recovering its operational 
functions quickly, and will have lessened the impact 
of dysfunctions caused by its population boom, geo-
climatic disruptions, and environmental pollution by 
addressing them from the root. Dakar will achieve this 
vision through five strategic objectives: 

LEVERAGE ENERGY 
EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES 
TO SUPPORT THE CITY’S 
RESILIENCE
We will leverage the wasted potential 
of energy saving technologies to 
solve long-standing unresolved 
electricity challenges

PROMOTE INCLUSIVE AND 
EFFICIENT GOVERNANCE
We will put in place collaborative 
platforms that encourage all 
stakeholders to take part in initiatives 
which support resilience

PROMOTE AN INCLUSIVE 
RESILIENCE AGENDA BY 
AND FOR DAKAR CITIZENS
We will put those who live in Dakar 
firmly at the heart of the resilience 
strategy in laying the foundations 
for active and sustainable citizen 
participation

PROVIDE A HEALTHY 
LIVING ENVIRONMENT TO 
DAKAR’S CITIZENS
We will make Dakar a pleasant city to 
live in by building more green spaces 
and ensuring a better system for 
citizens and professionals to manage 
waste

POSITION THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR AS A RESILIENCE 
PARTNER
We will foster and support the 
involvement of the private sector - 
both formal and informal - in building 
resilience

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
OF THE DAKAR RESILIENCE STRATEGY

19

By  aligning  with  the  definition  of  resilience  as  “the 
capacity  of  a  city  and  its  systems  to  anticipate, 
absorb,  respond,  and  recover  from  any  challenges 
and  disruptive  changes”,  we  are  convinced  that  the 
success of the Dakar resilience strategy rests on the:

active  participation  of  the  city’s  population  in 
its implementation, 
creation  of  a  safe  and  clean  environment  for 
Dakar’s citizens, 
private  sector’s  contribution  of 
solutions and employment, 
use of technology as a lever for resilience,
implementation  of  an  inclusive  and  efficient 
governance strategy. 

innovative 

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF THE RESILIENCE 
STRATEGY FOR DAKAR

The drafting process of Dakar’s resilience strategy 
has sparked a lasting collaboration between several 
stakeholder groups, particularly experts and decision 
makers from all levels of the public, private, and civil 
society spheres. 

In celebrating the choice of Dakar as part of the 100 
Resilient Cities network, the workshop to launch the 
strategy development process also served to anchor 
the framework and pillars for the development of a 
comprehensive resilience strategy for Dakar. More 
specifically, the workshop also accomplished the 
following:

a broad common understanding of the justification 
for the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, its mission 
and services in support to members;
a definition of resilience agreed upon by all 
stakeholders;
acceptance of the key concepts, definitions and 
institutional framework for resilience, as anchors 
to the approach and thinking to develop the 
resilience strategy for Dakar.

Soumbédioune fish market

Over 50 stakeholders and stakeholder groups were 
consulted during the Preliminary Resilience Assessment 
(PRA) phase. Interviews were conducted with each of 
them to: (i) present the initiative concept; (ii) understand 
their vision for the city’s resilience and the project; and 
(iii) identify the most critical shocks and stresses that 
the city may face. These interviews have also allowed 
us to: (iv) identify similar initiatives implemented or 
being planned; (v) identify the main stakes this strategy 
would have to consider; and (vi) gauge the stakeholders’ 
interest in participating in the drafting of the strategy 
within the thematic groups. This in anticipation of the 
lasting platform we will put in place to reach concrete 
results and ensure the successful is delivery of the 
resilience strategy of the city. 

The interviews with the different stakeholders enabled a 
refinement of the strategy through an iterative process 
of generating new ideas and a prioritization of existing 
ideas. Following this, we formed a group for each 
priority theme of the strategy. Each group was formed 
to promote diversity of backgrounds and maximize 
the quality of ideas generated. We then organized a 
workshop bringing together the CRO, citizens of Dakar, 
subject matter experts, and municipality professionals 
to share the main insights from detailed analyses of the 
different identified themes. This brought out the main 
strategic objectives and secondary objectives that were 
identified for the city. 

An awareness workshop on the drafting of the resilience 
strategy was conducted at the same time with the 
different services of the municipality, other internal 
stakeholders in the city, as well as representatives from 
all 19 communes. This workshop was delivered with the 
large group first and then in smaller groups. The 100 
Resilient Cities process was presented to participants 
who then engaged in conversations around the key 
themes of urban resilience. 

This participatory design process for the resilience 
strategy also helped identify a number of other 
initiatives. The ones that were shortlisted will allow 
stakeholders to better address the numerous shocks and 
stresses that Dakar faces to date or will likely face in the 
near future.

Primary and secondary objectives, as well as initiatives 
address the identified shocks and stresses at this stage. 
The selected 21 initiatives fleshed out in this strategy 
document have been built on top of existing projects 
and will strengthen the critical components of economic, 
social, environmental, and strategic resilience. The 
municipality of Dakar will play a catalyst role in kicking 
off and coordinating each of them. We will leverage the 
approach of putting stakeholders who care about the 
future of the city in conversation with each other. We 
will also strive to be surrounded with the best partners 

for the implementation of this strategy. Each of the 
initiatives will be implemented by capitalizing on the 
100 Resilient Cities broad network (similar initiatives, 
experience sharing, etc.), and by profiting from a 
platform of partners engaged in the strengthening of 
Dakar’s resilience. 

Our resilience strategy is not a fixed document. In a spirit 
of constant improvement, the document will be reviewed 
periodically to account for economic, political, social, 
and environmental changes that the city will experience.

PRESENTATION
OF SENEGAL

1.1. PRESENTATION OF SENEGAL

Senegal is a Sahelian country with two seasons: a 
dry season from November to May, and a wet season 
from June to October. Senegal is on a plateau with an 
altitude that is below 130 meters (with the exception of 
the South-East which can reach altitudes of over 580 
meters). The country’s geographic location and natural 
resources give rise to a diversity of ecosystems that 
constitute an important environmental asset. However, 
this natural capital is threatened by drought, soil and 
vegetation degradation, dire loss of biodiversity, as well 
as coastal erosion.

Senegal is one of Africa’s most politically stable 
countries. The country has considerably strengthened its 
democratic institutions since its independence in 1960. 
Senegal is a secular and democratic republic. It strives to 
ensure equality for all its citizens under the rule of law, 
regardless of their origins, race, gender, or religion. It 
acknowledges and respects all faiths. 

Senegal aspires to emerge out of poverty by 2035. The 
Emerging Senegal Plan (Plan Senegal Emergent – PSE) 
is an ambitious strategy devised by the government of 
Senegal to foster economic growth with a high impact 
on human development. Senegal’s government is 
determined to consolidate its achievements, especially 
in terms of democratic governance, and to reprioritize 
economic, political, and social stability. The success 
of this plan is rooted in generating investments for 
profitable sectors of the economy such as agriculture, 
tourism, housing, social economy, mines, logistics, and 
industry to catalyze high and stable growth. One of the 
PSE’s projects is to make Dakar a West African regional 
hub for companies and international institutions, for 
health and education services and tourism. To achieve 
these objectives and become a city of the 21st century, 
Dakar needs to develop strategies to increase its 
capacity to better respond and adapt to the burgeoning 
economic, social, and physical stresses.

Dakar is the western-most location in Senegal and 
Africa. It was established by Governor Protêt in 1857. 
Dakar (or Ndakarou in the Wolof language) is close to 
170 years old and 79 km² wide (0.04% of the national 
territory)17, on what was coined as the Cape Verde 
peninsula during colonial times. It shares its eastern 
border with the Thies region, and is surrounded by the 
Atlantic Ocean otherwise. The city of Dakar is one of 
the four departments that make up the region of Dakar: 
Guediawaye, Pikine, and Rufisque are the other three. Its 
population was estimated at 1.2 million as of 2015.18 

“It can be hard to provide the exact 
data about the city of Dakar because 
most people who come to Dakar don’t 
actually live in the city (hospital staff, 
workers, etc.) but depend on it con-
siderably for their economic activities” 
– Government official 

The city of Dakar has 19 communes: Biscuiterie, 
Cambérène, Dakar Plateau, Dieuppeul – Derklé - Castor, 
Fann - Point E – Amitié, Gorée, Grand-Dakar, Grand Yoff, 

Gueule Tapée – Fass - Colobane, HLM, Hann - Bel Air, 
Mermoz - Sacré Cœur, Médina, Ngor, Ouakam, Parcelles 
Assainies, Patte d’Oie, Sicap Liberté and Yoff. 

DAKAR, A CITY WITH A CHANGING POLITICAL 
AND GOVERNANCE LANDSCAPE

DAKAR, A CITY OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES

Within the framework of Decentralization Act III enacted 
on December 28th, 2013 (Loi n° 2013-10), each of the 
19 communes composing the city of Dakar has become 
autonomous and is governed by an elected mayor. Thus, 
the city of Dakar has been reduced to an administrative 
district. Coordination between the 19 communes and the 
department has become challenging. Another challenge 
is the lack of effective cooperation and dialogue 
between the central government and the municipalities, 
which hampers the city’s ability to provide quality public 
services to its citizens.

Dakar is home to 50% of Senegal’s urban population, 
95% of industrial and commercial plants, 80% of the 
country’s infrastructure and services, and 87% of 
formal jobs.19 Despite several attempts to decentralize 
development opportunities, this situation persists. 
People from rural areas and other cities in Senegal are 
attracted to Dakar because of its strategic position, 
economic activity (68% of the country’s GDP is 
generated in the city), and health and education 
infrastructure. Seventy-five percent of domestic 
movements of goods are originating in or routed to 
Dakar. The main driver of growth is the tertiary sector, 
which is mainly concentrated in the capital, particularly 
in Dakar-Plateau. 

The Leopold Sedar Senghor international airport is 

served by most major airlines with direct flights to the capitals of the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Middle East 
as well as to the rest of Africa. The largest port in the country, Port Autonome de Dakar (PAD), serves as a national 
entry point for imports and exports. The PAD also plays a key role in regional integration: for instance, 70% of 
imports by Mali from overseas transit through the PAD.20

27

Figure 4: Late Léopold Sédar 
Senghor

From its independence, Senegal has positioned itself 
as a beacon of African cultural and artistic diversity as 
spearheaded by its first head of state, Late Leopold 
Sedar Senghor. As a result, Dakar has been the host 
of the first and third World Festival of Black Arts 
(FESMAN) in 1966 and 2010. The Festival celebrates 
African and diaspora talent under the theme of African 
renaissance, and claims to be the largest gathering of 
black arts and cultures. It is both an intellectual and 
festive event. In 2016, Dakar hosted the 12th edition of 
the Dak’Art Biennale, one of the most prominent visual 
arts exhibitions in Africa, held in Dakar every two years. 
Official exhibits and ‘off’ exhibits bring a few hundred 
artists from Africa and the world. 

Dakar is also a cultural and intellectual hub as it is home 
to the Cheikh Anta Diop University and several regional 
educational institutions. In addition to being a member 
of the Organization of World Heritage cities with Gorée 
Island (world heritage site since 1978), Dakar is also 
one of the three creative African cities in the UNESCO 
creative cities network since 2014. 

UNESCO Director Irina Bokova declared during the 
Istanbul Conference on the Alliance of Civilizations in 
2011 that “culture is a source of resilience”. Culture is 
indeed not limited to dancing and music, it is a source of 
wisdom and inspiration, two traits that strengthen bonds 
between members of a community and helps them build 
resilience in times of catastrophes. 

“Whereas  politics  are  currently  the 
priority  in  a  time  of  seeking  national 
independence,  the  primacy  of  culture 
will always remain over politics and even 
the  economy.  Cultural  independence, 
defined  as  the  will  to  think  and  act  on 
one’s volition is the sine qua non condition 
of  all  other  forms  of  independence, 
including political independence. Culture 
is the end all be all of development.”

Léopold Sédar Senghor

DAKAR, A CITY OF INFLUENCE

The capital also hosts most government entities, 
diplomatic representations and offices of international 
institutions. Many diplomatic events are hosted in 
the city of Dakar. The offices of many international 
institutions as well as major company headquarters, 
(such as Sonatel - a national telecom company) are 
located in Dakar. 

DAKAR, A CITY OF YOUTH

Youth below 35 make up 72%21 of Dakar’s population, 
representing one of the city’s greatest assets but 
it poses, at the same time, significant challenges; 
especially in terms of education and employment 
provision. From its position as the economic capital 
of Senegal, the city is the destination of a massive 
migration (mainly youth) which spurs urban poverty. 
The unemployment rate is 15% in Dakar.22 Demographic 
boom has outpaced economic opportunities. This is a 
consequence, among others, of the slow growth of the 
private sector that is the main engine of job creation. 
Youth unemployment represents a stress to the city’s 
growth and sustainability. Addressing challenges 
for youth economic opportunities will contribute to 
unleashing the city’s potential.

OF 100 RESILIENT CITIES

CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES 
OF 100 RESILIENT CITIES 

2.1. CONTEXT OF 100 
RESILIENT CITIES

Developing cities are young, dynamic, ambitious, and
breeding grounds for innovation. However, they are often
burdened by fast and erratic growth. In 2050, about two
thirds of the world’s population will be living in cities. 
Therefore, to face this global challenge and to celebrate 
its 100 years of operations, the Rockefeller Foundation 
decided in 2013 to address three major forces: 

01

02

03

Urbanization. By 2050, three-fourths of the 
world’s population will live in cities, putting 
new strains on limited resources. 

Globalization. Cities are more interconnected 
than ever before – and a system failure in one 
city can cause collapse in economies across 
the globe.
Climate Change. For the many cities located 
in fragile ecosystems and along coasts, the 
impacts of climate change can be particularly 
catastrophic.

Urban resilience is generally understood to be the ability 
for individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and 
urban systems to survive, adapt, and develop despite the 
number of acute shocks and stresses they may face. 
Strengthening resilience in cities is now imperative, 
seeing the growth in the number and size of cities 

around the world. Given their importance in terms of 
economic growth, innovation, individual growth, social 
and cultural exchanges, cities ought to be treated 
with meticulous attention. The Foundation created an 
organization called 100 Resilient Cities, and has thus 
set for itself the objective to support 100 cities around 
the world in their efforts to strengthen their resilience 
strategy and operations.

« … the ability for individuals, 
communities, institutions, businesses, 
and urban systems to thrive, adapt, and 
develop despite the number of acute 
shocks and stresses they may face… » 
100 Resilient Cities

100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation thus looks forward to strengthening the 
operational capacity of 100 cities around the world, 
so they can fully attain their potential by preparing 
themselves against the shocks and stresses that come 
with urbanization, rapid population growth, urban 
mobility, climate change, etc. The first step of this 
process is the elaboration of resilience strategies specific 
to each city. Dakar and Durban are the first two African 
cities that have been selected in the first cohort of 100 
Resilient Cities (100RC).

In line with the 100RC recommendations, three major phases characterize the drafting process of the resilience 
strategy, as illustrated in the figure below.

The stages of the drafting process place equal emphasis 
on the results as well as the process itself. Stakeholders’ 
engagement from the beginning of the process is one of 
the key success factors of this approach. 

Dakar’s resilience strategy will be a dynamic and 
evolving tool that will be able to integrate new initiatives 
identified by relevant stakeholders in order to adapt 

to the growth of the city. The strategy thus has the 
ambition to be the first step towards a common 
and ongoing reflection process to bring solutions to 
problems faced by the city of Dakar. The strategy 
will finally facilitate the continuous identification of 
intervention opportunities beyond those presented in 
the sections that follow.

35

2.2. ALIGNMENT OF THE RESILIENCE STRATEGY WITH THE EXISTING 
URBAN PLANNING STRATEGIES FOR THE CITY OF DAKAR

In 2011, the municipality of Dakar engaged in a strategic 
planning exercise and called on its socio-economic 
partners in order to achieve their common objectives 
considering the social, economic, and environmental 
challenges facing the city. The resulting Strategic 
Orientation Document (Document d’Orientation 
Stratégique – DOS) is a city planning document 
that clarifies the vision, values, engagements, roles, 
and responsibilities of the city council of Dakar. The 
document also suggests means to achieve results in the 
medium term (2012-2017) and long term (by 2030). 

The municipality expressed the following vision: “Dakar 
is a driver of socio-economic and cultural performance, 
striving for good governance and sustainable growth, for 
the prosperity of its people.” This vision will be achieved 
through the following strategic areas: 

01
02

Dakar, a city with planned development;

Dakar, a beautiful city with an improved living 
environment;

03

04

Dakar,  a  city  focused  on  education,  health, 
wellness, and creativity through culture;

Dakar, a city aspiring to socio-economic 
development

Similarly, the Environment Action Plan (PACTE), 
aligned with the Agenda 21 and the DOS, is another 
key feature of the Cultural and Economic Development 
Plan (Plan de Développement Economique et Culturel 
– PDEC) focused on Dakar’s social and environmental 
responsibility. 

These planning documents are the plinth of the city’s 
resilience strategy that takes into account themes in the 
vision for the city and strategic intervention areas, while 
adding key elements of resilience. The resilience strategy 
has the ambition to become a reference document that 
all local and international partners could refer to, in order 
to provide their support in the implementation of actions 
to strengthen the city’s resilience.

STRATEGIC AND SPECIFIC RESILIENCE 
OBJECTIVES FOR DAKAR

3.1. CONTEXT AND IDENTIFICATION PROCESS  
OF RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES FOR DAKAR 

The first phase of the initiative consisted of a preliminary 
diagnostic of the city’s current resilience situation 
by ranking its available resources, potential threats, 
constraints, risks it is exposed to, as well as stakeholders’ 
perception of its resilience. This diagnostic phase 
resulted in a non-refuted conclusion: on all measures set 

forth by the components of the Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment (PRA) – a tool proposed by 100RC – Dakar 
is not perceived as a resilient city. The only area in which 
the city showed some strengths was “stability and 
security”, as illustrated by the stakeholders’ perception 
tool below.

Figure 7: Perception of stakeholders on the resilience of Dakar

Source: Dalberg, 2015, Preliminary Resilience Assessment

39

Therefore, Dakar shows a weak economic, sanitary, infra-
structural, and strategic resilience. In addition, the PRA 

has allowed the identification of nine priority shocks, and 
a number of stresses represented in the below figures.

The city thus faces several stresses of which 23 were 
identified during the preliminary diagnostic. They are 
illustrated here above. Some the most urgent stresses 
identified include:

•  Unemployment, and more specifically the low 

diversity of employment opportunities for youth

•  Frequent power outages and poor access to 

technology (low bandwidth, etc.)

•  Environmental degradation (pollution caused by 

lack of access to water and sanitation services) 
and the effects of climate change (coastal 
erosion, rise of sea levels, etc.) 

•  Weak community and civic engagement, and 

chronic mendacity

“ Waste management costs the government, 
+10 billion (CFA francs) but yet several 
families do not have access to collective 
sanitation services. In addition, horse 
cart owners (informal actors for waste 
collection) dispose their loads in illegal 
dump sites, which increases the city’s cost 
of cleaning the streets.” – Research institute

This process resulted in the identification of six main in-
tervention areas (illustrated below). Climate change has 
been added in addition to these intervention areas as a 
cross cutting intervention, affecting all the others. 

23 Stresses were evaluated using a risk assessment tool developed by 100RC. The tool uses stakeholder perceptions during the preliminary resilience assessment and allocates 
them probabilities from 0 (low likelihood) to 1 (high likelihood) based on their likelihood of occurrence. Stresses are then weighted against the likelihood of occurrence of 
shocks, which typically would show the amplitude of the stress itself.

diagnosis

CIVIC ENGAGEMENT
How can Dakar citizens’ civic 
engagement be promoted? 
Particularly in the interest of 
developing responsible practices 
when it comes to hygiene, security, 
and solidarity? 

WATER AND SANITATION
How can waste water and rain water 
be appropriately processed, and 
how can clean water be distributed 
efficiently? 

HEALTH
How can the use of health 
infrastructure be maximized in order 
for the people of Dakar to benefit 
from reliable health services? 

URBANIZATION
How can responsibilities be shared 
efficiently in urban planning? How 
should the urban plans be formulated 
along with the transportation plans 
while ensuring their implementation? 

ENERGY
Which strategies can allow the supply 
of enough energy of good quality for 
the city, while optimizing for its costs 
and externalities?

DIGITAL ECONOMY
How can quality digital services be 
disseminated to the city’s inhabitants, 
as well as contribute to its growth? 

CLIMATE CHANGE
How can the intervention areas 
mentioned above contribute to the 
lessening of climate change effects in 
the city? 

Strategy’s priority intervention area

Additional intervention area

Cross cutting intervention area

Five discovery areas have been shortlisted as critical 
levers to reinforcing Dakar’s resilience following a review 
process with the city’s stakeholders. The perceptions 
gathered from these stakeholders and the risks and 
assets analysis were the basis of the selection process 
for the top five discovery areas with high impact 
potential on the city’s social and economic resilience: 
(i) civic engagement, (ii) climate change readiness, (iii) 
sanitation and, (iv) energy efficiency. Urban mobility, 
which is as critical, will be addressed later due to 
capacity.

The second phase of the initiative consisted of 
developing a resilience strategy for the city focused 
on the priority intervention areas identified during the 
preliminary resilience diagnostic. The development of 
the resilience strategy thus resulted from an in-depth 
study of the shortlisted priority intervention areas 
in order to identify a large portfolio of high impact 
activities that address the city’s challenges. 

Urban mobility, civic engagement and climate change 
were not included in the detailed analyses of the focus 
areas, in the context of the resilience strategy. However, 
the various existing studies on these topics over the 
years, were leveraged. Sanitation and energy efficiency 
reports are accessible.

Since it has joined 100RC, Dakar, primarily through its 
Chief Resilience Officer has hosted several awareness 
and knowledge sharing campaigns with stakeholders 
in government, civil society, and the private sector, as 
illustrated below. This process was reinforced through 
a workshop to validate findings and intervention 
opportunities, as well as to formulate the city’s vision for 
resilience and set the objectives to achieve it. Important 
stakeholders who took part in the workshop include 
the municipality, government representatives from 
key sectors (Waste management coordination unit – 
UCG), private sector actors (Federation of Electricity 
Enterprises in Senegal – FESELEC), and research 
institutions (African Institute for Urban Management – 
IAGU).

3.2. FIVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
FOR A RESILIENT DAKAR 

The analysis of the priority intervention areas included 
(i) a literature review; (ii) interviews with national and 
municipal authorities, as well as stakeholders from 

the formal and informal private sector; and (iii) the 
identification of a range of preliminary intervention 
opportunities for the resilience strategy. 

Figure 12: Process for elaborating the vision and objectives 
of Dakar’s resilience strategy

45

The objectives of the resilience strategy thus take into account the shocks and stresses, as well as the analysis of the 
five priority intervention areas. 

Figure 13: Links between resilience challenges and selection 
of strategic objectives

Source:  Dalberg, 100 Resilient Cities initiative, preliminary resilience assessment 2015; Dalberg analyses

The strategic objectives are directly in support 
of the vision: to make Dakar a city THAT IS 
CLEAN, SAFE, ENERGY EFFICIENT AND POISED 

FOR INCLUSIVE GROWTH. Each primary strategic 
objective includes secondary objectives, around 
which initiatives are developed.

46

a. Promote an inclusive resilience agenda by and for Dakar citizens

The recurrence and persistence of risks facing the 
city is strongly linked to the behaviors and attitudes 
of its citizens. Weak civic engagement, inconsistent 
construction practices, poor waste disposal behaviors, 
anarchic occupation of roads, unhealthy lifestyles, and 
environmental degradation are all stresses caused 
by citizens’ behaviors. The inability to control and 
correct such behaviors and attitudes can have massive 
repercussions or can become important shocks for 
the city (fires, epidemics, infrastructure collapse, civil 
violence, etc.). A shared understanding and buy in from 
the population, as well as an inclusive approach will 
be building blocks to the generalization of resilience 
practices. 

Awareness of the link between on one hand, natural 
and urban environments, and on the other, social and 
economic development, is essential on the journey to 
resilience. In this context, Dakar’s resilience strategy 
should be a repository of multiple interventions by all its 
citizens. 

Civic disengagement is at best a lack of understanding 
or failure to carry out one’s civic duty, or at worse 
indifference about the city’s affairs. This can be the 
result of a lack of investment in dialogue or social 
solidarity efforts, and the absence of a culture of shared 
responsibility about city preservation. Civic education 
is thus a crucial factor for the harmonious development 
of a city. In fact, citizens who understand and respect 

common laws: are able to discipline themselves and 
adopt responsible behaviors towards their community; 
are knowledgeable of human and civic rights; and 
understand the importance of upholding the values of 
peace, solidarity, and environmental friendliness. These 
abilities are key assets to promoting harmony within 
their communities. 

Citizens should be at the heart of the resilience strategy 
to bring out the strong link between human actions 
and their effects on the challenges the strategy seeks 
to solve. To do so, it will for instance be necessary to 
innovate methods of knowledge sharing, education, 
and city-wide communication channels to improve 
citizens’ comprehension of the problems they face 
and promote the concept of resilience as a tool to 
solve those problems sustainably. In addition to this, 
awareness campaigns will be conducted with religious 
leaders, traditional chiefs, and influential figures who 
play a thought leadership role in their community, whose 
voices are heard and respected.

“ Roads are constantly misused and run 
the risk of disintegrating quickly due to 
the high number of people. In addition, 
rain water canals have become dumps.” 
– Municipal authority

b. Create a healthy living environment for Dakar’s citizens

For citizens to be proud of their city, they need to 
feel that they are living in a safe and harmonious 
environment which can allow them to improve their 
living conditions. Dakar has witnessed the destruction 
of several of its green spaces, but also the lack of 
planning for housing, as well as rising pollution levels.24 
Dakar produces more than 850 tons of waste daily, but 
more than 400,000 (38.5%)25 of its inhabitants do not 
have access to basic sanitation services. This leads to 
a proliferation of illegal dump sites all around the city. 
In addition, 30% of the population doesn’t have access 
to sewage services; some call on manual emptiers who 
dispose of their liquid waste into the surroundings. 
Lastly, green spaces from the time of independence, 
which served as parks and could have contributed to 
the preservation of the environment, have increasingly 
been disappearing due to rapid urbanization and 

irregular construction all over the city. These elements all 
contribute to the degradation of the city’s environmental 
landscape. 

Improving the living environment of its residents should 
be one of the essential services that the municipality 
offers. This would range from improving organization of 
sanitation services to raising awareness about activities 
that can be detrimental to the environment. The 
municipality of Dakar has expressed a strong interest in 
improving the living conditions through the launch of 
programs such as the Environmental Action Plan (Plan 
d’actions environnementales – P.ACT.E) – City of Dakar, 
and the program clean city “Dakar Set Wecc”. These 
initiatives should be strengthened in the framework of 
the resilience strategy.

Overview of the Environmental Action Plan (P.ACT.E.) – City of Dakar

47

In order to translate the shared vision of the municipality, “Dakar by 2025”, into concrete 
ecological and civic behaviors, the Direction of Planning for Sustainable Development 
(Direction de la Planification et du Développement Durable – DPDD) of the municipality 
of Dakar have developed in 2013, the Environmental Action Plan (PACTE). It is a decision 
making tool as well as a good governance tool to integrate an environmental dimension 
when designing projects and interventions for Dakar’s sustainable development and 
when implementing these projects. The P.ACT.E is part of the Agenda 21 of Dakar and 
serves as a harmonization document between the city’s environmental efforts and tools 
from the central government. 
The P.ACT.E’s specific objectives are: 

•  To build an environmental plan and projects to ensure improved solid waste 

management, control pollution from domestic and industrial liquid waste, and 
develop an adapted sanitation system;

•  To give priority to the urban renewal and high impact large planning projects; 
•  To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce climate change effects by 

saving energy in buildings (energy efficiency tools and renewable energy 
integrated into buildings); 

•  To support a green economy that generates revenues and employment. 

The PACTE is thus the engagement from the municipal authorities to undertake neces-
sary changes for a sustainable development of the city.

Dakar Clean City « Dakar Set Wecc » initiative

The Dakar Clean City initiative was officially launched in 2012 with the aim to rid the 
city of trash and electronic waste that obstructs its roads and avenues. The Ministry 
of Decentralization and Land Planning, with the support of the municipality of Dakar, 
launched this initiative with bins placed in strategic locations around the city. In order to 
further incentivize the population to take part in their city’s sanitation, the municipality 
also supported the launch of a song about good sanitation practices entitled “Dakar 
set wecc, aqu dekk-bi” (A clean Dakar - the city’s right), as well as a song about urban 
development titled “Aqu dekk-bi” (The city’s rights). In the same vein, the municipality of 
Dakar was also engaged in a vast campaign consisting of removing hawkers from main 
roads and sidewalks.

 “ Green spaces must be multiplied across the city in order to 
improve the living environment, with the very few unoccupied 
spaces that remain.” – Neighborhood council official 

48

c. Position the private sector as a resilience partner 

The lack of economic prosperity is another area 
of intervention identified for the city, based on the 
perceptions of the population. This perception is further 
confirmed by stresses identified in the preliminary risk 
assessments such as unemployment, lack of diversified 
employment opportunities, limited access to credit, 
causes or effects of low productivity of the private 
sector, and to an extent, lack of economic prosperity. 
The private sector has an important role to play in the 
resilience strategy of the city, not only by investing and 
forming partnerships for the delivery of the resilience 
initiatives, but also through the creation of employment 
opportunities for social stability. However, the private 
sector is not sufficiently empowered or associated 
to fully play its role, as expressed in the preliminary 
assessment.

Besides, the Senegalese economy rests predominantly 
on the informal sector which contributes 42% to the 
wealth of the country, and employs more than 48.8% 
of the working population.26 The informal economy has 
thus been the main driver of the construction of the 
city and urban life. For instance, the company Dakar 
Dem Dikk (DDD), an urban transportation company, 
cannot fulfill the demand for all neighborhoods. 
Until recently, its 280 buses only covered 25% of the 
demand in transport.27 The gaps of Dakar Dem Dikk 

gave rise to an informal transportation sector. The 
“cars rapides” (refurbished buses), yellow-and-black 
taxis, and “clandos” (‘clandestine’ taxis) transport more 
than 875,000 passengers daily, and have become the 
common modes of transportation.28 Similarly, in the 
sanitation sector, 38.5%29 of households in Dakar use the 
services of informal waste collectors (horse cart owners 
and manual pit emptiers). The intervention of these 
informal players is thus essential to the city’s functioning, 
but can equally contribute to the city’s environmental 
pollution (illegal dump sites across the city), or create 
urban congestion, etc.

“ The informal sector needs to be 
organized and valued in order to 
adequately support and strengthen the 
city’s resilience. ” – Municipal authority

The municipality will thus have to give an important role 
to the private sector in acting as a resilience partner 
by promoting a climate favorable to investments and 
economic activity, by engaging and coordinating the 
informal sector, and by promoting local products 
and services as means to generate local wealth and 
employment.

d. Create a healthy living environment for Dakar’s citizens

Dakar incurs the costs of limited supply of energy 
and frequent power outages - 11.8 power outages 
occur every month on average. These lead to a loss of 
one percentage point in the city’s GDP every year.30 
Furthermore, Dakar consumes 56.9% of the national 
energy supply (about 1.3 TWh in 2013) and will need an 
additional supply of 50MW to meet its current demand.31 

With an average annual growth rate of 4.4%,32, 33,  the 
electricity consumption of Dakar is expected to double 
between 2013 and 2030.34  At the same time, Senegal 
has committed to reduce its emissions of CO2 from 
the energy sector by 17% by 2030. Focusing only on 
developing electricity supply has shown its limits given 
the amount of investments required, against limited 
public resources and competing priorities in education, 
health and basic infrastructure. 

“ Senegal needs to make a 
technological leap forward by 
leveraging technology to distribute and 
manage electricity. ”– Private sector 
stakeholder, company specialized in 
electric technologies. 

While it is important to note that electricity is managed 
at the central government level and thus not in the 
capacity of the city, local authorities have a crucial 
role to support government efforts to ensure that the 
energy needs of all citizens are met. However, ensuring 
energy sufficiency is complex and requires interventions 
across various areas including policy and regulation, 
technology, and behavior change. Encouraging the 
adoption of energy efficient technologies among citizens 
is a simple and cost-effective way local authorities can 
engage to reduce energy wastage.

e. Promote inclusive and efficient 
governance

Governance institutions that are actively engaged 
and collaborate closely are essential to implement the 
resilience strategy, especially in the context of cities 
with a special status such as Dakar where the central 
government and municipality work in the same territory 
and share responsibilities on several aspects. For 
instance, sanitation, which was managed for a long time 
by the municipality, has now become the responsibility 
of a government institution, as well as the collection 
and allocation of taxes to finance the sector which is 
exclusively managed at the central government level. 
The procurement of housing permits or electricity 
licenses is equally controlled by the central government. 
Despite the decentralization act, Dakar is in a context 
where the central government and municipal authorities 
operate within the same jurisdiction with the common 
mandate to provide basic necessities and a safe living 
environment to residents. However, there are several 
overlaps between these two powers, which often hinder 
the progress of activities and initiatives to develop 
the city. Dakar has now became a stage for political 
stakes and negotiations between the central power 
and the municipality. This state of affairs negatively 
impacts the speed and transparency of procedures. An 
important cautionary step in the design of the resilience 
strategy was to acquire a clear comprehension of these 
relationships. 

“ Different institutions should work in 
synergy more often (e.g. Direction of 
Urbanization to deliver construction 
permits with ONAS) for a better 
organization of vulnerable sectors 
and enforcement of the construction 
regulations.”– Association of private 
sector companies 

To overcome the city’s vulnerability and put in place 
an efficient resilience strategy, collaboration between 
the central power and municipality is paramount. This 
can go a long way in ensuring a shared understanding 
of the concept of resilience and its initiatives for the 
city, as well as the provision of quality services to 
citizens. The collective action spearheaded by the city’s 
Mayor, technical advisors in the public sector, and the 
central government will be necessary to carry out the 
resilience strategy of Dakar. Citizens should benefit from 
institutions that work better than they do now, and that 
are capable of consistently providing services of better 
quality. Besides, the implementation of an inclusive 
and efficient governance strategy will contribute to 
a positive relationship between institutions and the 
citizens so as to provide them with a clean and safe 
living environment.

ENVISIONING THE CITY OF DAKAR:  

A RESILIENT SYSTEM

ENVISIONING THE CITY OF DAKAR:  
A RESILIENT SYSTEM

Cities are systems; consisting of multiple composite 
parts, contributors and subsystems. Improving the 
individual systems that make up a city will increase 
the resilience of the city overall. Resilient systems 
withstand, respond to, and adapt more readily to shocks 
and stresses to emerge stronger after tough times, 
and last better in good times. We view the strategic 

objectives and the associated initiatives outlined in this 
document as essential contributors to strengthening the 
city of Dakar’s resilience. In developing each initiative, 
the following resilience qualities were taken into 
consideration, as these aid in enhancing each initiative as 
well as contributing to the overall resilience of the city.

55

Qualities of resilient systems

REFLECTIVE: Using past 
experience to inform future 
decisions

ROBUST: Well-conceived, 
constructed, and managed 
systems

RESOURCEFUL: Recognizing 
alternative ways to use resources

INCLUSIVE: Prioritizing broad 
consultation to create a sense 
of shared ownership in decision 
making. Inclusive processes 
emphasize the need for broad 
consultation and ‘many seats at the 
table’ to create a sense of shared 
ownership or a joint vision to build 
city resilience. For example, early 
warning reaching everyone at 
risk will enable people to protect 
themselves and minimize loss of life 
and property.

INTEGRATED: Bringing 
together a range of distinct 
systems and institutions that 
ensure investments and actions 
are appropriate, addressing the 
needs of the most vulnerable and 
collectively creating a resilient city 
– for everyone.

REDUNDANT: Spare 
capacity purposively created to 
accommodate disruption due 
to extreme pressures, surges in 
demand or an external event. It 
includes diversity where there are 
multiple ways to achieve a given 
need. For example, energy systems 
that incorporate redundancy 
provide multiple delivery pathways 
that can accommodate surges in 
demand or disruption to supply 
networks.

FLEXIBLE: Willingness and 
ability in adopting alternative 
strategies in response to changing 
circumstances. Systems can 
be made more flexible through 
introducing new technologies or 
knowledge, including recognizing 
traditional practices. For 
example, in times of crisis, cities 
may redeploy public buses for 
emergency evacuations.

Robustness, redundancy and flexibility are qualities that help conceive systems and assets that can 
withstand shocks and stresses as well as the willingness to use alternative strategies to facilitate rapid 
recovery.

56

57

Primary objective A:
Promote an inclusive resilience agenda by and for Dakar citizens

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE A.1.: EMPOWER CITIZENS TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPRESS THEIR 
THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE CITY’S RESILIENCE, AS WELL AS PROPOSE SOLUTIONS

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: The process of strengthening the resilience of the city first begins with alignment, 
by all citizens, of the challenges facing the city so they are able to propose and implement solutions addressing 
those challenges. To achieve this alignment and push to action, the citizens of Dakar should feel that their feed-
back is taken into account and inspire actions taken by the municipality. The city should implement inclusive and 
participative initiatives to collect feedback from citizens at all levels and integrate the proposed solutions into 
resilience initiatives. By leveraging ideas from citizens who are confronted with the city’s challenges on a day to 
day basis (urban mobility, floods, sanitation, etc.), the city will promote inclusive resilience. 

INITIATIVE A.1.1.: ENHANCE CITIZENS’ COMPREHENSION OF RESILIENCE FOR DAKAR
INITIATIVE A.1.2.: CREATE A MECHANISM FOR ONGOING COLLECTION OF CITIZEN’S FEEDBACK ON THE 
CHALLENGES AND RESILIENCE OPPORTUNITIES 
INITIATIVE A.1.3.: INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF RESILIENCE IN BASIC EDUCATION
INITIATIVE A.1.4.: EXPLORE (EARLY WARNING) TOOLS AND SERVICES TO PROVIDE DAKAR CITIZENS WITH 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON IMMINENT SHOCKS IN REAL TIME

Initiative A.1.1. 

ENHANCE CITIZENS’ COMPREHENSION OF RESILIENCE FOR DAKAR

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Ensure comprehension of the concept of resilience by all citizens of Dakar

•  Spark the citizens’ interest in, and contribution to resilience through active citizenship 

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: Comprehension of resilience and active citizenship is weak among Dakar 
citizens. Civic acts such as crossing roads using pedestrian crossings or disposing of trash in bins are 
simple gestures that the city’s citizens don’t often perform. Public property is often stolen (e.g. electric 
posts, rails) or destroyed (e.g. during riots against public authorities). Some citizens are convinced that 
citizenship is the State’s responsibility as some colloquial expression suggests: “mbedd mi, mdeddou bour 
leu” (literal translation: streets belongs to the State; meaning, we are allowed to do whatever we want in 
the streets since the State is in charge of fixing it). To change such attitudes, this initiative aims to spread 
the concept of resilience and foster active citizenship among Dakar citizens. This will propel the rise to: 

•  Autonomous citizens, who understand and respect the law, are capable of self-regulation, and adopt 

responsible behaviors for themselves and for those around them; 

•  Citizens capable of engaging in conversations about the city’s affairs, debating with discernment, 

and taking initiative; 

•  Citizens who are conscious about the resilience challenges facing their country and communities, in 
order to develop a sense of belonging and choose to adopt more responsible behaviors, as well as 
citizens who transmit this awareness to those around them. 

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative will spark the rise of new types of citizens who are conscious of their civic duty in the 
city’s prosperity and who embrace resilience-promoting behaviors. It will also empower communities to 
have increased civic engagement, and will generate strong traction around the implementation of the 
resilience strategy.

interests, youth organizations, religious 
associations, etc.) to help amplify awareness 
creation efforts within communities – these 
groups played a crucial role in awareness 
creation for HIV/AIDS reduction in Senegal

•  Train existing sensitization groups to support/

relay awareness messages, and also to support 
in times of acute shocks such as floods

Initiative A.1.2.

CREATE A MECHANISM FOR ONGOING COLLECTION OF CITIZEN’S FEEDBACK ON 
THE CHALLENGES AND RESILIENCE OPPORTUNITIES 

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Elicit a feeling of inclusion of citizens in the core of the city’s actions, and incorporate their feedback 

in implementation of various initiatives

•  Ensure citizen’s ownership and buy-in towards the resilience strategy

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Citizens are both actors in and beneficiaries of efforts that strengthen the city’s resilience against the risks 
it faces. As such, they need to be and feel at the core of resilience initiatives, and therefore necessitating 
awareness and expression of their perception of resilience within their communities. The intervention aims 
to address this need and to spark citizens’ involvement and ownership of Dakar’s resilience strategy.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative will promote a common understanding and shared perspectives in the Dakar community of 
the city’s resilience, as well as encourage citizens to act towards strengthening the city’s resilience.

•  Poll citizens on their comprehension of 
the concept of resilience through photo 
competitions, text messages or phone calls, 
etc. 

•  Quiz citizens about their understanding of 

resilience, for instance by texting in local 
languages “what is resilience?” and have them 
respond

•  Collect citizen’s ideas on civic acts that could 

strengthen the city’s resilience, using for 
instance, a photo competition 

ACTION 2: EXPLORE/DEVELOP TOOLS FOR

•  Explore existing platforms such as the 

city’s mobile application currently under 
development, NAVIGEM, as a tool for citizen’s 
feedback collection

•  Develop alternative tools to ensure broader 

reach

Initiative A.1.3.

INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF RESILIENCE IN BASIC EDUCATION

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Ensure an understanding and ownership of the concept of resilience by Dakar citizens from an early 

age in order to generate spontaneous behaviors strengthening resilience

•  Anchor civic values in the basic education of all Dakar citizens

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Formal education includes aspects of civic and moral education, but needs to be strengthened so that 
people understand at an early age (during elementary school) the concept of resilience. On the other 
hand, with a net school attendance rate of 61% (UNICEF, 2015), a significant proportion of Senegalese 
children of school age do not get enrolled in formal primary education. Some are enrolled in Koranic 
schools «Daaras» where they receive religious education. Education on resilience and active citizenship 
should be extended to all educational institutions. These modules would be delivered through all channels 
including education in public schools, private schools, as well as Koranic schools. Thus all children, 
regardless of the educational system in which they find themselves, will have the basic knowledge to be 
active actors of resilience and active citizens.
CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative strengthens the commitment and collaboration among industry players for better 
accountability in educating marginalized populations. It promotes the emergence of communities sharing 
the concept of resilience. It also contributes to the empowerment of people by anchoring the concept of 
resilience at an early age, regardless of the form of education received.

existing curricula on civic and moral education 
and possibilities to introduce a resilience lens

ACTION 2: DISSEMINATE CURRICULA ACROSS 
VARIOUS BASIC EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

•  Define mechanisms and timelines to ensure 

introduction of the curricula in the formal 
education channels

•  Hold discussions with Koranic schools and 

other educational institutions

Initiative A.1.4.

EXPLORE (EARLY WARNING) TOOLS AND SERVICES TO PROVIDE DAKAR CITIZENS 
WITH ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON IMMINENT SHOCKS IN REAL TIME

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Be informed of the shocks to which the city could be exposed in real time

•  Prepare the city and its population to prevent and respond effectively in case of a major shock’s 

occurrence through an effective response and communication system

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: In 2013, Dakar experienced floods that caused a loss of life and injuries to 
populations, and infrastructure to collapse. Citizens were not prepared for such events, given the lack 
of anticipation and communication about its potential impact. For example, a few months before the 
rainy season or time of high tides, the municipality could start communicating on disturbances observed 
to anticipate and reduce eventual damages caused by flooding or other major hazards. National and 
international observatories keep track of natural events preceding major shocks, but such information is 
not actively used to the best advantage of the city. This situation raises the need for the city (population 
and ecosystem stakeholders) to be prepared to respond in a timely way, in the event that such shocks 
occur, through an effective response and communication system.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
Provides a reliable database on the state of vulnerability of the city. Builds a resilient city, informed of its 
key challenges, through early detection of and warning about imminent shocks. Ensures the protection 
of populations, and helps prevent shocks that can be anticipated such as floods, tornadoes, seismic 
movements, etc.

WARNING TOOLS   

•  Initiate consultations with stakeholders 

involved in meteorology, observation and 
monitoring of major shocks, as well as those 
evolving at the national level in Senegal, to:

•  Establish an up-to-date database of the 

city’s vulnerability state

•  Set up a mechanism to receive and relay 

information on real-time major shocks ahead 
of time

•  Explore existing international early warning 

systems that can provide data on Dakar’s 
climate situation and other relevant information 

ACTION 2: ESTABLISH A NETWORK OF

•  Leverage the city’s mobile application currently 

under development, NAVIGEM, to integrate 
real-time information, and advise people when 
imminent risks are detected 

•  Develop alternative tools to proactively 

communicate upstream periods of vulnerability, 
behaviors to avoid/counter damages, and 
procedures in case of major shocks (e.g. 
daily/weekly radio programs) to populations, 
irrespective of their education level

Primary objective B:  

Provide a healthy living environment to Dakar’s citizens

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE B.1.: PROMOTE INITIATIVES TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: Environmental protection is an integral part of the preservation of living species. To 
achieve this, the municipality of Dakar will initiate projects to make the city greener, and to reduce emissions of 
greenhouse gases. Achieving environmental protection requires a collaborative effort of all stakeholders. Thus, in 
the short term, the municipality will implement initiatives that involve all stakeholders including the private sector 
and citizens to take resilience actions contributing to a harmonious life. 

INITIATIVE B.1.1.: REINSTATE PUBLIC GREEN SPACES IN THE CITY
INITIATIVE B.1.2.: IMPLEMENT SYSTEMS FOR PROMOTING ECO/GREEN LIFESTYLE

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE B.2.: IMPROVE THE CITY’S SANITATION

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: Sanitation is a sector facing many challenges in the city of Dakar. The city generates 
850 tons/day of waste,  of which a non-negligible part end up in 40 arbitrary dumps  (ecological bombs) in the 
city, due to uncontrolled disposal of waste. This situation presents public health hazards to the population, and 
alternative solutions must be sought to provide the population with organized sanitation services or to reduce the 
quantity of waste produced or dumped, especially through recycling. The municipality will take several actions 
including:

•  The installation of public recycling bins throughout the city for better waste management

•  Implementing a program to curtail arbitrary and hazardous dumps through collaborations with horse cart 

owners and UCG dealers

•  Launching a digital platform to disseminate best practices and increase technical expertise of actors in 

sanitation

•  Creating a competition to spur innovative solutions for drainage management

•  Reorganizing horse cart owners to encourage sorting of trash according to recycling norms

INITIATIVE B.2.1.: INSTALL PUBLIC RECYCLING BINS THROUGHOUT THE CITY FOR A BETTER WASTE 
MANAGEMENT
INITIATIVE B.2.2.: IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO CURTAIL ILLEGAL AND HAZARDOUS DUMPS THROUGH 
COLLABORATION WITH HORSE CART OWNERS AND UCG DEALERS
INITIATIVE B.2.3.: LAUNCH A DIGITAL PLATFORM TO DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES AND IMPROVE 
TECHNICAL GUIDANCE FOR ACTORS IN SANITATION
INITIATIVE B.2.4.: CREATE A COMPETITION TO SPUR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR DRAINAGE 
MANAGEMENT IN DAKAR
INITIATIVE B.2.5.: ORGANIZE HORSE CART OWNERS IN COOPERATIVES TO ENCOURAGE SORTING OF 
TRASH ACCORDING TO RECYCLING NORMS

Initiative B.1.1.

REINSTATE PUBLIC GREEN SPACES IN THE CITY

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Conservation of biodiversity

•  Preservation of green spaces for leisure and relaxation 

•  Enforcement of land use policy

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Since the independence era, the green areas of Dakar have considerably decreased. The Hann National 
Park remains the only green place left in the city. Rehabilitating green spaces across the city thus 
represents a means to fight against climate change. The initiative will consist of collaborating with the 
private sector to develop public gardens and playgrounds in different areas of the city - neighborhoods, 
empty spaces between motorways, along main roads of the city, etc.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative will create a greener, well-kept, and people friendly city. It will also ensure an inclusive 
management of resilience initiatives through effective framework for partnership between the public 
sector and the private sector.

IMPLEMENT SYSTEMS FOR PROMOTING ECO/GREEN LIFESTYLE

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Create a healthy living environment for the residents of Dakar

•  Ensure active contributions by all stakeholders towards protecting the environment 

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Pollution and environmental degradation are both stresses identified in the city during the preliminary 
resilience assessment. The region of Dakar produces about 15,786 million tons of CO2 annually, mainly 
from industrial activities and energy production, transportation of people, and household activities.35 The 
current initiative aims to ensure resilience building by all stakeholders, using the private sector as a driver 
of change. It will encourage the adoption of «green» behaviors for environmental protection (e.g. reduced 
waste generation; reforestation of public spaces; use of less polluting vehicles, etc.) through a taxation 
incentive scheme. Companies complying with the defined standards will enjoy benefits such as tax 
reduction, and on the flipside, those not complying will incur tax penalties. The municipality will explore 
ways to collaborate with the private sector to create a healthy living environment for people.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative encourages users to respect and protect the environment in their daily activities. Moreover, 
it will reduce pollution in the city to further prevent climate change related damages through coordinated 
action of all stakeholders.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE B.2.: IMPROVE THE CITY’S SANITATION

OPERATING  ASSUMPTION:  Sanitation  is  a  sector  facing  many  challenges  in  the  city  of  Dakar.  The  city  ge-
nerates 850 tons/day of waste,36 of which a non-negligible part end up in 40 arbitrary dumps37 (ecological 
bombs) in the city, due to uncontrolled disposal of waste. This situation presents public health hazards to the 
population, and alternative solutions must be sought to provide the population with organized sanitation ser-
vices or to reduce the quantity of waste produced or dumped, especially through recycling. The municipality 
will take several actions including :

•  The installation of public recycling bins throughout the city for better waste management

•  Implementing a program to curtail arbitrary and hazardous dumps through collaborations with horse cart 

owners and UCG dealers

•  Launching a digital platform to disseminate best practices and increase technical expertise of actors in 

sanitation

•  Creating a competition to spur innovative solutions for drainage management

•  Reorganizing horse cart owners to encourage sorting of trash according to recycling norms

INSTALL PUBLIC RECYCLING BINS THROUGHOUT THE CITY FOR A BETTER WASTE 
MANAGEMENT

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Encourage Dakar citizens to adopt systemic sorting of waste before disposal

•  Educate Dakar citizens on better sanitation management

•  Provide a healthy living environment for Dakar citizens 

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Almost all of the 850 tons of solid waste38 generated in Dakar every day are sent to the Mbeubeuss 
landfill where they do not undergo further processing, other than the informal circular economy on 
site,39 and pose a risk to the environment. In order to limit the consequences of the city’s poor waste 
management, households have to get accustomed to sorting their trash in specific bins. The sorted waste 
can then be recycled and this provides a way to reduce waste and create economic opportunities through 
recycling.40

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative ensures the provision of basic sanitation services. It will also reduce the amount of waste 
normally sent to landfills, and provide economic opportunities through waste recycling for the private 
sector. The initiative has the power to spark a gradual change of population habits in sorting waste 
both in public places and also in homes. This intervention can lastly engage communities to be more 
responsible in the management of waste.

IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO CURTAIL ILLEGAL AND HAZARDOUS DUMPS THROUGH 
COLLABORATION WITH HORSE CART OWNERS AND UCG DEALERS

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Reduce the proliferation of illegal dumps in the city

•  Coordinate with horse cart owners to structure their intervention into the value chain

•  Empower residents to manage household waste

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
The landscape of Dakar is characterized partly by heaps of rubbish and plastic bags disposed 
haphazardly throughout the city. More than 400,000 people (38.5% of the population of the city of 
Dakar) that are not covered by collective sanitation services, are served mainly by horse cart owners 
who are informal collectors of solid waste.41 These horse cart owners unload the collected trash in nature, 
creating dumps which become ecological ticking time bombs (there are 40 in the city currently).42 Trash 
collection and treatment in Dakar is largely managed by the national waste management agency (Unité 
de Coordination et de Gestion des déchets – UCG), which provides neighborhoods with bins and trucks 
for daily garbage collection. Collaboration between horse cart owners and dealers of UCG is thus needed 
to phase out illegal dumping, by allowing horse cart owners to dump their daily toll of trash in UCG’s 
trucks, saving them time when compared to their current approach. 

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative will strengthen the commitment of stakeholders in waste management, and ensure the 
consistency of waste collection services. This will encourage cooperation between the public sector and 
the informal private sector to provide solutions together with resilience and above all, to ensure health 
and environmental protection.

LAUNCH A DIGITAL PLATFORM TO DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES AND IMPROVE 
TECHNICAL GUIDANCE FOR ACTORS IN SANITATION

OBJECTIVES: 

access to their products

•  Promote actors’ involvement in all aspects of the sanitation sector in Dakar and create channels of 

•  Facilitate communication and coordination between industry actors

•  Strengthen stakeholders’ capacity using an online library with tutorials on technical sanitation and 

recycling

•  Demonstrate waste management value chain

•  Shift cultural perception on stakeholders in the sanitation value chain

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
According to the preliminary resilience assessment, Dakar faces challenges such as inadequate sewage 
treatment, poor solid waste collection system, and low capacity of human resources. The sanitation 
sector is not popular in Dakar and actors in the sector are victims of poor public perception for 
dealing with a sector that for instance, produces recycled or recovered goods. Moreover, when highly 
appreciated objects (arts and decorative objects, bags, furniture, etc.) are produced in the recycling 
industry, communication efforts are often insufficient to inform users of supply channels, and investors 
about investment opportunities. Finally, there are limited formal training programs for actors across the 
sanitation value chain. 

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative strengthens the public-private partnership to support economic prosperity while also 
providing for basic services. It provides users a reliable information base on the sanitation sector and 
facilitates private sector involvement in sanitation management.

CREATE A COMPETITION TO SPUR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR DRAINAGE 
MANAGEMENT IN DAKAR

OBJECTIVES: 

system in Dakar

•  Challenge local actors to generate innovative ideas for a more effective drainage management 

•  Implement most feasible and cost effective solutions to reduce floods in Dakar during the rainy 

seasons

•  Provide a healthy environment for residents by reducing occurrence of epidemics related to flooding

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
30% of Dakar households are not covered by collective liquid sanitation services, thus the use of manual 
draining methods, or illegal connections to the drainage networks which lead to overload of the drainage 
networks. In addition, drainage systems are not cleaned frequently and sometimes are turned into dump 
sites for solid waste. Such situations lead to major floods during the wet season. While the flood situation 
particularly affects the city of Dakar, the drainage networks are managed at the central government level, 
through the National Sanitation Organization (Office National de l’Assainissement du Sénégal – ONAS). 
The municipality of Dakar does not have direct authority over the drainage systems and resources for 
its management. The initiative thus consists of creating a competition to spur innovative ideas among 
citizens, the private sector, the academia, etc. in response to the water drainage management system 
(e.g. drainage cleaning, expanding coverage capacity, behavioral change interventions, recycling, etc.). 
Most feasible and cost effective solutions could be implemented through PPPs between the National 
Sanitation Organization (ONAS) and private players, in an effort to combine science and technology with 
policies and systems. 

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative empowers local actors to think through their city’s challenges and contribute to solving 
them. Improving water drainage management systems also helps reduce public health hazards risks and 
makes the city an enjoyable environment for its residents.

ORGANIZE HORSE CART OWNERS IN COOPERATIVES TO ENCOURAGE SORTING OF 
TRASH ACCORDING TO RECYCLING NORMS

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Coordinate the intervention of horse cart owners in the trash sanitation value chain

•  Educate households in sorting trash according to recycling norms 

•  Improve the performance of the value chain

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Approximately 38% of the population of the city of Dakar, estimated at 400,000 inhabitants, is not 
covered in the collective sanitation system43. The waste produced by these populations is collected by 
independent horse cart owners who do not have proper equipment and dump waste in nature, creating 
environmental hazards. Furthermore, the delivery system of sorted waste for recycling industry needs is 
highly disjointed and waste sorting is done in several steps along the chain. This redundancy of activities 
leads to investing additional resources that increase the cost of waste sorted for recycling. The following 
statistics characterize the sanitation sector in the city of Dakar:

•  850 tons/day44 of trash generated in the city, and routed to Mbeubeuss;

•  38% sand (unnecessary burden in most public bins)45;

•  3% of putrescible (reusable compost and fertilizer)46;

•  9% plastic (recyclable or recoverable brick, pavers, public toilets, etc.)47;

•  ~13,000 horse cart owners carrying trash to in illegal dumps because of the distance to the 

Mbeubeuss central waste dump48;  

•  40 arbitrary dumps (ecological bombs) in the city, presenting public health hazards.

The trash value chain can be made more efficient by reorganizing the intervention of horse cart owners 
and performing a systematic sorting of waste prior to collection. Organizing the horse cart owners as 
cooperatives also provides formality for unorganized informal actors, and opportunity to connect them to 
the sanitation platform49.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative helps empower households to be actors of resilience, and improve their social conditions. It 
capitalizes on the strength of the informal sector for improved resilience, and ensures the protection of 
the environment through the reduction of illegal dumping as well as the reduction of the amount of waste 
sent to landfills.

Primary objective C: 

Position the private sector as a resilience partner 

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE C.1.: PROMOTE THE EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIPS FOR RESILIENCE AT MUNICIPAL LEVEL (CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRIVATE 
INVESTMENTS)

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: There are several investment opportunities for the private sector in Dakar. Some of 
these  may  be  the  responsibility  of  the  central  government  to  structure,  but  others  are  definitely  promoted  by 
the Municipality. These include better management of sanitation, energy efficiency, and protection of the living 
environment. On the one hand, the private sector requires substantial support (technical, regulatory, and financial) 
to play their role more effectively as economic growth and resilience drivers to address the key challenges of the city. 
On the other, they must be made aware of investment opportunities, or their role could also be stimulated through 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and streamlining recognition mechanisms by the municipality. The 
municipality will aim to leverage collaboration opportunities with private actors for enhanced resilience.

INITIATIVE C.1.2.: PROVIDE SUPPORT TO SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (SMES) ACTIVE IN RESILIENCE 
BUILDING

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE C.2. : PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH BY LEVERAGING BOTH THE 
FORMAL AND INFORMAL SECTOR

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: Many entrepreneurs, artisans and designers operate in the city of Dakar but struggle 
to  find  markets  for  their  products  and  services.  Initiatives  are  already  being  implemented  at  national  level  to 
encourage the consumption of local agricultural products, but few are implemented at the city level. In May 2016, 
Orange/Sonatel, Senegal CITYDIA, and the CSR Senegal Initiative organized a round table on CSR and “Consuming 
Local”. The roundtable focused on the economic potential of local consumption in Senegal, and the means for a 
better consideration of development issues for SMEs operating in the sector of agricultural transformation. Dakar, 
being the first center of consumption in the country, wants to insert and magnify these dynamics by leveraging 
both the formal and informal economy. Consumers need to be educated, to overcome the complex of the imported 
product and think more highly of local products when shopping. At the same time, local businesses will ensure 
the  supply  and  availability  of  quality  products  that  are  diversified  and  affordable  (#MadeInDakar).  The  waste 
recycling sector is particularly an area of interest for the promotion of local products given the low current draw 
for consumers despite its double objective of reducing pollution and creating wealth.

Initiative C.1.1.

IMPROVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS (SENELEC, UCG, ONAS) 
AND PRIVATE ACTORS FOR BETTER SANITATION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
(ENFORCEMENT OF NORMS, INSTALLATION OF SMART METERS, ETC.)

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Enhance collaboration between public sector actors and the private sector

•  Establish a mechanism to ensure compliance with sanitation and energy efficiency standards

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Resilience building activities require collaboration between the public sector (who develops and ensures 
enforcement of regulations) and the private sector (who facilitates the provision of basic services 
to populations). However, there is little collaboration between these two sets of actors in regards to 
compliance with the standards and management of resilience related activities (e.g. weak collaboration 
between UCG and horse cart owners for waste disposal; lack of coordination between ASN, SENELEC, 
PROQUELEC, and FESELEC for electrical installation standards, etc.). There is a  public-private 
partnership framework at the national level but it is not applied at the level of the city. This framework 
could be improved in Dakar to better integrate resilience solutions (effective energy management, waste, 
etc.). This initiative aims at strengthening the public-private partnership framework by introducing 
simpler and streamlined processes (simple and less cumbersome procedures) to facilitate collaboration 
between the two sets of stakeholders. 

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative advances long term planning and broad stakeholder inclusion. It strengthens the position of 
the private sector as a driver of resilience.

•  Municipality and utility service providers 
to define common procedures for better 
management and coordination around Dakar’s

Initiative C.1.2.

PROVIDE SUPPORT TO SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (SMES) ACTIVE IN 
RESILIENCE BUILDING 

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Promote potential benefits that come with integrating resilience in SMEs’ activities

•  Ensure targeted support and enable access to financing mechanisms tailored to SMEs dedicated 

to sectors that support the city’s primary resilience focus areas (sanitation, energy efficiency, 
protection, and preservation of the environment, etc.)

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Few companies take into account resilience in their initiatives (e.g. reduced quantities of waste produced, 
efficient energy management, environmental conservation), or engage in resilience related initiatives (e.g. 
waste recycling, production of renewable energy, etc.) The main obstacles to private sector investment, in 
particular SMEs, in activities related to resilience include: (i) lack of information on the potential benefits 
of such endeavors, (ii) lack of targeted support for SMEs involved in such activities, and (iii) lack of 
appropriate financial mechanisms. To meet these challenges, business development support institutions 
(such as Bureau for SME development, ADEPME, etc.) and incubators in the ICT sector like CTIC will be 
leveraged to initiate programs that support the development of SMEs in activities related to resilience 
through (i) establishment of an incubator or resilience lab and (ii) creation of a green financing grant 
mechanism.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative encourages the private sector to participate in resilience related interventions. It provides a 
unique funding mechanism that maximizes the investment of SMEs operating in sectors that strengthen 
resilience.

ACTION 1: IDENTIFY START-UPS AND SMES 
DEDICATED TO RESILIENCE-RELATED ACTIVITIES 
IN ORDER TO DEVELOP, WITHIN EXISTING 
INCUBATORS AND ENTREPRENEUR FORUMS, A 
RESILIENCE LAB OR INCUBATOR ADAPTED TO 
THEIR NEEDS  

•  Leverage existing incubators and entrepreneur 
forums to host and support identified start-ups 
and SMEs

•  Select ideas through a business plan 

competition to ensure the best initiatives are 
supported

•  Provide support services to incubated start-

ups and SMEs depending on their need 
and maturity (e.g. workspace, technology 
systems, access to sector experts, business 
development, managerial skills training, access 
to network and financing opportunities, access 
to markets)

ACTION 2: LAUNCH A GREEN INVESTMENT FUND

•  Design most appropriate financing mechanism. 

E.g. the fund may take the form of a credit 
line with reduced interest rates provided 
through banks, or of a private equity fund 
where companies have a long-term loan (3 to 
5 years), associated with technical, operational, 
and managerial support to maximize the use of 
received funds

•  Facilitate access to credit for all incubated 

SMEs and those involved in focus areas related 
to the city’s resilience priorities, to enable them 
to develop their initiatives

Initiative C.2.1.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE C.2: PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH BY LEVERAGING BOTH THE 
FORMAL AND INFORMAL SECTOR

OPERATING  ASSUMPTION:  Many  entrepreneurs,  artisans  and  designers  operate  in  the  city  of  Dakar  but 
struggle to find markets for their products and services. Initiatives are already being implemented at national 
level to encourage the consumption of local agricultural products, but few are implemented at the city level. In 
May 2016, Orange/Sonatel, Senegal CITYDIA, and the CSR Senegal Initiative organized a round table on CSR 
and “Consuming Local”. The roundtable focused on the economic potential of local consumption in Senegal, 
and the means for a better consideration of development issues for SMEs operating in the sector of agricultural 
transformation.  Dakar,  being  the  first  center  of  consumption  in  the  country,  wants  to  insert  and  magnify 
these  dynamics  by  leveraging  both  the  formal  and  informal  economy.  Consumers  need  to  be  educated,  to 
overcome the complex of the imported product and think more highly of local products when shopping. At the 
same time, local businesses will ensure the supply and availability of quality products that are diversified and 
affordable (#MadeInDakar). The waste recycling sector is particularly an area of interest for the promotion of 
local products given the low current draw for consumers despite its double objective of reducing pollution and 
creating wealth

CREATE A #MADEINDAKAR LABEL TO BRAND LOCALLY SOURCED AND PRODUCED 
GOODS 

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Encourage the increased production and consumption of local products

•  Promote economic prosperity and job creation through stronger engagement of the private sector

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Local products are not sufficiently promoted and often face high competition (in terms of price and 
quality) with imported ones. Therefore, Dakar citizens consume less local products and have a preference 
for imported products. Boosting the local economy and local private sector development appear as 
sustainable means of job creation and strengthening economic resilience, therefore there is a need to 
encourage and promote the consumption of local products. The intervention consists of creating a label 
#MadeInDakar, combining both quality assurance, cultural grounding, and community resilience and is an 
effective way to spur consumption of local products.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative empowers communities to contribute to economic resilience through increased production 
and consumption of local products, reducing imports and promoting economic growth. It also helps to 
empower the private sector to provide good quality products and strengthens protection of citizens 
through assurance of distribution of quality products. Finally, it provides opportunities for creating 
cooperatives as a channel to formalize informal actors and recycling activities.

FACILITATE ACCESS TO MARKETS FOR RECYCLED PRODUCTS

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Promote consumption of local products and provide economic opportunities for recycled products

•  Encourage private sector participation in waste recycling as a means for environmental protection 

and improved management of the sanitation sector 

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
About 23% of waste generated in the city of Dakar is composed of putrescible waste (appropriate for 
making compost and fertilizers); 12% is paper and cardboard (used for manufacturing of office materials, 
crates for eggs distribution, etc.); and 9% is recyclable plastic (re-usable to create new plastic materials 
such as pavers, road signs, etc.). Liquid waste can be equally used to process compost or irrigation 
water used for agricultural production. However, access to markets is a challenge for the expansion of 
recycling activities, due to negative social perception on recycled products and limited support provided 
to companies for the promotion of local products (Made in Dakar). The initiative aims at promoting 
consumption and access to market for recycled products through a quota for recycled products in the 
administration’s procurement system. Products that may be covered include: the provision of office 
equipment (made from recycled paper); the construction of public assets (streets pavement, traffic 
lights installation, etc. using recycled plastics); and the maintenance of public spaces (with compost and 
fertilizer from putrescible waste).

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative promotes local products and import substitution through the #MadeInDakar label and job 
creation. It empowers a large number of private and institutional stakeholders in waste management and 
environmental protection.

inputs used for the construction / maintenance 
of public infrastructure)

•  Encourage procurement though suppliers 

using recycled materials

ACTION 2: EXPAND MARKET ACCESS THROUGH

•  Explore incentive mechanisms for procurement 

of recycled products by the private sector 
(e.g. significant reductions in taxes for these 
companies)

ENHANCE EXISTING MUNICIPAL LED INCUBATOR FOR INFORMAL ECONOMIC 
ACTORS50  

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Develop more sustainable businesses to support economic growth

•  Leverage the informal sector as a contributor to the city’s resilience

•  Promote more job opportunities to youth

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
The municipality of Dakar has recently created an incubator to support youth-led initiatives in the IT 
sector. The initiative aims to enhance the existing incubator to provide services to the under-represented 
informal economic sector. In fact, the informal sector contributes to 42% of the economy and employs 
48.8% of the active population.51 However, informal businesses lack adequate support to use their full 
potential to expand and further contribute to economic development and job creation. Many actions have 
been undertaken to formalize informal firms through sanctions, but have not always been successful. This 
initiative will bridge gaps in assisting these firms so as to increase their contributions to employment and 
income while they remain informal.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative promotes local products and import substitution through the #MadeInDakar label and job 
creation. It empowers a large number of private and institutional stakeholders in waste management and 
environmental protection.

Primary objective D: 

Leverage energy efficient technologies to support the city’s resilience 

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE D.1.: PROMOTE THE ADOPTION OF ENERGY CONSERVATION 
TECHNOLOGIES

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: The increase in urban population causes congestion, increasing pressure on scarce 
resources, such as energy, and increases the exposure to shocks such as extended power outages, fires (sometimes 
due to anarchic installations of electrical systems), and stresses such as high cost of electricity and high cost of 
living. Ensuring energy sufficiency is complex and requires interventions across various areas including policy and 
regulatory, technology, and behavior modification. Given the limited authority of the municipality of Dakar over 
energy production and distribution, the city will use energy efficiency as an entry point to addressing the city’s 
energy challenges over the long term, and to meet the growing pressure of resource needs. Energy efficiency 
does not address the full range of complex energy-related issues, but helps solve an important part within the 
jurisdiction of the municipality.

DISSEMINATE INFORMATION AND PROMOTE STANDARDS ON ELECTRICAL SYSTEM 
INSTALLATIONS

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Ensure citizens are well-informed about energy efficiency policies, regulations and standards 

•  Ensure electrical installations meet the standards of the Senegalese Standards Association (ASN) in 

order to reduce energy wastage and avoid accident

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
In Dakar, 93% of electrical installations do not meet the standards set by the Senegalese Standards 
Association (ASN).52 Failure to comply with these standards lead to many dangers including fires. For 
instance, of the 2036 fires registered in 2013, over 50% came from an electrical fault.53 This is due in part 
to the lack of a systematic compliance monitoring facilities and the limited capacities of the Association 
for the Promotion of Internal Electrical Installations Quality of Senegal (PROQUELEC).

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative aims to minimize the risks of electricity-related accidents by promoting ownership of 
standards by users.

PROMOTE END USER AWARENESS AND ADOPTION OF ENERGY-SAVING 
OPPORTUNITIES

OBJECTIVES: 

conservation

•  Enable citizens to understand that their actions matter and empower them to contribute to energy 

•  Provide energy conservation guidance to citizens

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Frequent occurrence of power outages result in economic losses for Dakar: 11.8 power outages occur 
every month on average.54 These lead to a loss of one percentage point in the city’s GDP every year.55 
In addition, Demand for electricity will double between 2013 and 203056 due to projected population 
growth. However, inefficient consumer practices such as the use of incandescent lamps accounting for 
about 70%57 of Dakar’s lighting contribute to energy wastage, and most citizens are unaware of their 
ability to contribute to energy-saving.

COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ACROSS THE CITY TO REDUCE ENERGY WASTAGE FROM 
AIR CONDITIONING

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Demonstrate adoption of innovative technologies towards substantial energy savings

•  Demonstrate projected increase in access from energy savings

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Most commercial buildings in Dakar use 5-6 air conditioning units on average. Most of these lack thermo-
regulator vis-à-vis external factors, resulting in energy wastage. Gradually installing thermostats in air 
conditioning units by 2021 could generate energy savings of 51 million kWh between 2017 and 2021, 
equivalent to 28% of consumption in cooling these buildings in 2013 (or the equivalent of the annual 
consumption of about 232,000 kWh in Senegal in 2013).58

CAVEAT: 
Ensuring energy sufficiency is complex and requires interventions across various areas including policy 
and regulatory, technology, and behavior modification. This initiative uses energy efficiency as an entry 
point. However, it does not address the full range of complex energy-related issues.

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Demonstrate adoption of innovative technologies towards substantial energy savings

•  Demonstrate projected increase in access to electricity from energy savings

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
While lighting accounts for 23%59 of household electricity consumption at the national level, this 
proportion increases to nearly 50%60 in buildings for professional use. At the national level and in the 
capital, incandescent lamps represent 70% of the lighting park even though they offer much lower 
performance than new-generation lamps such as LBC or LED lamps, consume up to five times more 
energy than LED lamp, and have a life span of 15 to 25 times less. An increase in LED lamp usage to 90% 
by 2030 in commercial buildings could generate energy savings of 1.4 billion kWh between 2017 and 
2030, equivalent to more than 11 times the 2013 lighting consumption (or the equivalent of the annual 
consumption of nearly 11 million Senegalese in 2013).61 The central government ban “Decree No 2011-160 
on January 28th 2011” prohibits import and sale of incandescent lamps but this is yet to be implemented.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
This initiative further explores the potential to use energy-efficient technologies to help reduce energy 
wastage and improve sustainability, through the reduction of greenhouse gases. Generated energy

CREATE A COMPETITION TO SPUR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE 
CITY’S ENERGY CHALLENGES

OBJECTIVES: 

in Dakar

•  Challenge local actors to generate innovative ideas for a more effective energy management system 

•  Provide alternative solutions to the city’s energy challenges, beyond consumption (e.g. alternative 

energy sources and distribution mechanisms)

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
Frequent power outages result in economic losses for Dakar: 11.8 power outages occur every month 
on average, and these lead to a loss of one percentage point in the city’s GDP every year. Demand for 
electricity will double between 2013 and 203062 due to projected growth. Since, electricity production 
and management is managed at the central government level, through the SENELEC, ensuring energy 
sufficiency becomes complex as the city has limited control over energy production, distribution, and 
management. Such a situation requires exploring innovative approaches to address the city’s energy 
challenges, by putting ideas of all stakeholders to contribution.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative empowers local actors to think through their city’s challenges in regards to energy and 
contribute to solving them. Improving access to, and management and use of energy has the potential to

Primary objective E:  

Promote inclusive and efficient governance 

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE E.1.: FOSTER INSTITUTIONAL COLLABORATION TO IMPROVE SERVICE 
DELIVERY

DESCRIPTION.: The current political context of integrated communalization commands that the approach pursued 
in the search for resilience improves and ensures sustainability of the larger urban ecosystem components. This 
requires  a  systemic  collaboration  among  relevant  public  stakeholders  driven  by  a  common  will  to  implement 
a  robust  and  achievable  urban  resilience  strategy.  However,  decentralization  (“Act  III”,  law  2013-10)  has  led  to 
political  misunderstandings  and  lengthy  negotiations  between  the  central  government,  the  municipalities,  and 
local officials, resulting in limited coordination and siloed planning. This objective addresses a concern of making 
Dakar an inclusive city with the participation of all key stakeholders (central authorities, administrative officers and 
municipality workers).

INITIATIVE E.1.1.: ENHANCE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPAL 
ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS RESILIENCE BUILDING COLLABORATIONS 
INITIATIVE E.1.2.: INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF PUBLIC SERVICE PERSONNEL TO BECOME AGENTS OF 
INTEGRATION OF RESILIENCE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

Initiative e.1.1.

ENHANCE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPAL 
ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS RESILIENCE BUILDING COLLABORATIONS

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Foster common understanding between central and municipal authorities for effective 

implementation of Dakar’s resilience strategy initiatives

•  Build upon existing collaboration frameworks between the city and the central government and 

explore further opportunities

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
The close collaboration between the actors of the central government and municipal level is essential 
for a successful implementation of Dakar’s resilience strategy. There are regional development agencies 
(Agences Régionales de Dévelopment – ARD) tasked with ensuring harmonization of national and 
local interventions within the geographical limits of each municipality. However, for budgetary reasons 
or planning, monitoring of consultation frameworks and harmonization of national and municipal 
interventions is not always effective. For example, the Intended nationally determined contribution on 
climate change (Contribution Prévue Déterminée au niveau National – CPDN) provides several initiatives 
to be implemented in the city of Dakar (e.g. establishment of a Bus Rapid Transit - BRT driver) and also at 
national level. This could facilitate the vertical and horizontal collaboration that are required to undertake 
most initiatives as they seek to strengthen existing collaboration frameworks and explore further 
opportunities.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
The initiative fosters cross jurisdictional collaboration and empowers a broad range of regional, municipal, 
and community actors. It strengthens cooperation with various municipalities and the central government 
for the smooth implementation of national initiatives, with clearly defined implementation timelines. The 
initiative equally fosters cross jurisdictional collaboration.

ACTION 2: DEFINE NODES FOR COLLABORATION 
TOWARDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPDN’S 
ACTIONS AS PERTAINS TO THE CITY OF DAKAR

•  Conduct a cross- mapping of CPDN activities 

and Dakar resilience strategy to understand 
areas of overlap and build upon these 
synergies and identify planned initiatives 
for the city of Dakar within the CPDN (e.g. 
establishment of a Rapid Transit Bus)

•  Explore collaboration mechanisms: period of 
implementation, government contributions, 
and the city’s contributions for timely 
implementation 

Initiative e.1.2.

INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF PUBLIC SERVICE PERSONNEL TO BECOME AGENTS OF 
INTEGRATION OF RESILIENCE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

OBJECTIVES: 

•  Promote a shared vision of resilience among public service officers

•  Develop public servants’ knowledge and understanding of Dakar’s resilience building priorities

•  Integrate a resilience lens in public affairs’ management

OPERATING ASSUMPTION: 
For effective implementation of Dakar’s resilience strategy, it is essential to ensure a shared vision of 
the concept of resilience among institutions; the public and private sectors, as well as among their staff. 
The technical staff of public services is often the primary implementer of government initiatives and 
must be in line with Dakar’s resilience agenda. This initiative aims to improve the level of knowledge of 
the technical staff of public services (municipality of Dakar, and in the 19 communes composing the city 
of Dakar) about the concept of resilience, and to ensure their capacity to apply a resilience lens in the 
implementation of public services and initiatives. Some technical services to target in the municipality of 
Dakar include the Directorate of Planning and Sustainable Development (PDSD), the Urban Development 
Department (DDU), the Directorate of Technical Services (DST), the Directorate of Health and Action 
Services to individuals (DASS), the Department of Education and Assistance for Insertion (DEI), etc.

CONTRIBUTION TO RESILIENCE: 
Municipal staff with technical expertise hold primary responsibility for implementation of Dakar’s 
resilience strategy. This initiative empowers public institutions employees to implement initiatives 
effectively using a resilience lens to fulfill their mandates in this regard. Capacity building will 
progressively empower staff to mainstream and institutionalize resilience in the implementation of all 
public initiatives.

MONITORING AND
EVALUATION MECHANISM

5.1. INSTITUTIONAL 
IMPLEMENTATION SYSTEM

With the advent of decentralization in 1996, the 
territorial organization of the country has become 
more complex due to the layering of several levels 
of decentralized authorities (region, departments, 
municipalities, county boroughs, and rural communities). 
At the same time, decentralized local authorities 
(regions, departments, districts) that represent the 
territorial command have remained topical. 

Actors had nourished the hope that Act 3 of 
decentralization, in 2013, would reduce this complexity 
by abolishing the region and rural communities from 
an administrative point of view. However, when applied 
to the Dakar Region, Act 3 resulted in the erection 
of 19 self-sufficient towns under the city of Dakar. At 
the same time, the city of Dakar remains a territorial 
administration though it cannot make decisions in the 
name of the 19 towns without prior agreement. This 
has reinforced the hierarchical frustration locally and 
conflicts of causes, competence and power prevail.
In addition, the rise of multiple projects, as well as the 
proliferation of structures for their implementation 
(typically known as agencies) has caused malfunctions 
and conflicts given the lack of coordination between 
central and local authorities. 

The implementation of the resilience strategy must take 
into account this institutional context and encourage the 
municipality to find new channels of cooperation with 
the other players at the communal, regional, and national 
level for concerted action and cooperation. To do this, 
the Municipality will use various means some of which 
are listed below:

THE SIGNING OF FRAMEWORK AGREEMENTS 
WITH KEY TECHNICAL PARTNERS

The municipality will identify, for each initiative, 
the main partners in the city, region or country. 
It will thus establish with these organizations 
(technical services, companies or state agencies, 
public institutions and implementing agencies) 
framework agreements allowing it to solicit 
updates on the progress of the implementation of 
initiatives.

THE SOLICITATION OF PARTNER PLATFORMS

Aside from public partnerships, the municipality 
will build on partner platforms developed under 
the definition of resilience strategy to accelerate 
the implementation of some initiatives. In 
particular, the platform of the initiative “100 
Resilient Cities” which facilitates partnering 
with service providers and investors for the 
implementation of resilience initiatives will be 
leveraged. On the other hand, other thematic 
platforms can also be explored (eg. governance 
of decentralized cooperation, European Union, 
International Council for Local Ecological 
Initiatives - ICLEI).

The City will also use external consultants, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), associations, 
private companies or mixed economy, and 
technical and financial partners (TFP) foreign to 
accompany the implementation of the action plan.

“ We must focus on strengthening 
stakeholder capacities of technical 
services for an effective implementation 
of the resilience strategy ” - 
Governmental Authority

THE CREATION OF AD-HOC COMMITTEES

The Municipality will form, during its first annual 
session, commissions to study subjects within 
its jurisdiction. Thematic commissions, including 
stakeholders from various backgrounds, will 
be put in place to initiate reflections about the 
best ways and options to implement specific 
interventions. For example, a commission, 
bringing the National Office for Sanitation of 
Senegal (ONAS), the Ministry of Water and 
Sanitation, the Coordination Unit of the Solid 
Waste Management (UCG), representatives of 
district associations / municipalities and the 
informal sector could be set up for initiatives 
related to improved sanitation and waste 
management in the city.

115

5.2. MONITORING AND 
EVALUATION MECHANISM
The  resilience  strategy  is  not  a  static  document.  It  is 
called  to  be  reviewed  periodically  to  take  into  account 
the  economic,  social  and  environmental  developments 
in the city, but always in the spirit of building resilience. 
In  this  context,  the  CRO  must  ensure  that  the  steering 
committee,  the  representative  of  all  stakeholders, 
continues  to  exist,  to  monitor  the  implementation  of 
actions,  and  recommend  adjustments  to  the  strategic 
plan.

Moreover, the capacity of the municipality administration 
in  monitoring  and  evaluation  must  be  reinforced.  The 
CRO  and  the  Directorate  of  Planning  and  Sustainable 

Development can together ensure regular monitoring of 
the  implementation  of  action  plans  from  the  resilience 
strategy.

They  will  be  provided  with  the  human  and  financial 
resources and the tools to support these tasks (steering 
dashboards,  IT  platform,  etc.).  The  IT  platform,  when 
created and is functional, will also be an impact assessment 
tool  for  the  overall  implementation  of  the  strategic 
plan.  This  dashboard  will  be  accessible  to  all  townships 
in  the  city,  taking  into  account  the  areas  and  levels  of 
responsibility.  A  summary  will  also  be  communicated 
to  all  those  involved  in  achieving  the  objectives  of  the 
strategy, including Dakar citizens themselves.
