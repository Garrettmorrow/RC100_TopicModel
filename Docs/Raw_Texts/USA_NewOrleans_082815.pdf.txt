LETTER FROM THE MAYOR

August 25, 2015

Dear Friends,

Nearly 10 years ago, on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, 
becoming the costliest disaster in United States history. As that fateful storm shrouded 
our city in darkness, the federal levee system protecting New Orleans failed, flooding 80 
percent of our city and the homes and businesses of 1 million people in the region.  
In total, Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath claimed over 1,800 lives.

After the last decade of Katrina, Rita, Ike, Gustav, Isaac, the BP oil spill, and the Great 
Recession, it is safe to say that New Orleans has faced the biggest challenges any 
American city has ever faced. But New Orleans is a resilient place with resilient people. 
With resolve, determination, and commitment from the entire nation across public, 
private, and philanthropic sectors, we not only came back, but we are rebuilding 
New Orleans better and stronger than before. 

Even as some continue to deal with the effects of Katrina and the federal levee 
failure, there are new challenges that confront us—climate change and rising sea 
levels, land subsidence and coastal erosion, and lack of equity and opportunity for all 
New Orleanians to grow and thrive. For our city, being resilient means more than levees 
holding back water and wetlands protecting us from storms. It means striking a balance 
between human needs and the environment that surrounds us while also combating the 
chronic stresses of violence, poverty, and inequality.

As we look to our future challenges and opportunities, our innovative spirit will help us 
find creative solutions that protect the city’s people, culture, and infrastructure. Our 
commitment to action will define the next chapter of the city’s history. We must seize 
the moment. We not only have an opportunity to continue in the positive direction of the 
past several years, we have a responsibility to get it right and set the city on a more just 
and sustainable path for generations to come. We cannot afford to fail. 

As we move beyond the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina toward our city’s 300th 
anniversary in 2018, I am calling on each of you to join in our shared vision of becoming  
a global leader in urban resilience.

Sincerely,

Mitchell J. Landrieu 
Mayor

EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY

Three years from now, New Orleans will 
enter its fourth century. When it is home 
to the next generation of New Orleanians, 
what sort of place will it be? 

The actions we take today will shape our 
future city for the coming generation. 
What must we do now to make the 
next generation more equitable, more 
adaptable, and more prosperous? 
How can we make their New Orleans a 
dynamic urban landscape—aligned with 
its natural environment? What leadership 
is needed—from individuals, communities, 
and the public and private sectors—to 
realize the city we envision? 

Resilient New Orleans addresses these 
questions and sets forth aspirations to 
guide our work and specific actions to 
tackle these challenges. We are building 
upon the existing visions and plans 
developed over the past decade. Guided 
by 100 Resilient Cities—Pioneered by 
The Rockefeller Foundation, Resilient 
New Orleans combines local expertise 
with global best practices to confront 
our most urgent threats and seek ways 
to redress our legacy of inequity and risk. 
We propose bold yet pragmatic actions 
to adapt our city to our changing natural 
environment, invest in equity, create 
flexible and reliable systems, and prepare 
for future shocks. 

Our approach is organized into three 
sections, each with a vision for our 
future city. 

ADAPT TO THRIVE
We are a city that embraces our 
changing environment.

By adapting our city to our natural 
environment and the risks of climate 
change, we can create opportunities 
for all New Orleanians to thrive. We 
must align our infrastructure and 
urban environment with the realities 
of our delta soils and geography. Our 
adaptation must be both physical and 
behavioral. Rather than resist water, we 
must learn to embrace it, building on 
the confluence of Louisiana’s culture, 
history, and natural systems. As we look 
to the wisdom of the past, we must also 
prepare for the risks of the future.

We will adapt to thrive by advancing the 
restoration of our coastal wetlands, which 
protect our communities and support our 
economy. We will implement our regional 
Urban Water Plan to reduce flood risk, 
mitigate soil subsidence, and beautify our 
communities. We will provide incentives 
to property owners to retrofit their 
homes to be more resilient to storms. We 
will further environmental stewardship 
programs to create a culture of 
environmental awareness at every stage 
of life. Just as we adapt to our changing 
climate, we will also commit to mitigating 
our own contribution to climate change. 

CONNECT TO OPPORTUNITY
We are an equitable city. 

By investing in equity, we are investing 
in resilience. Equity will be the driving 
force behind our economy’s growth and 
innovation, our communities’ safety and 
stability, and our families’ health and 
prosperity. While New Orleans’ economic 
recovery and growth in recent years has 
been remarkable, it has not been enjoyed 
equitably. We will grow our economy by 
investing in stable, healthy communities 
where individuals have the training, 
access, and support needed to connect 
to opportunity. 

City of New Orleansemerge stronger. Through a small 
business resilience initiative, we will 
develop the preparedness of our 
business owners and entrepreneurs. 

For centuries, we have demonstrated our 
ability to innovate and adapt in the face 
of major challenges. While New Orleans 
has recovered from many shocks in 
the past, our future is threatened by 
rising seas and coastal erosion, crime 
and a lack of economic opportunity, 
income inequality and disparate health 
outcomes. We now stand before a 
critical threshold. We must move beyond 
the devastation of the past and cross 
into the possibilities of the future.

New Orleans will continue to lead, serving 
as an urban laboratory for innovation 
and change, working to recognize and 
adapt to an unpredictable future, and 
remaining committed to the equitable 
adaptation and transformation of coastal 
cities worldwide. As a global leader, we 
have a responsibility to seek wisdom and 
guidance from around the world, to listen 
to the stories of our peers, and to share 
our progress toward shaping the future 
city—a Resilient New Orleans. 

 

To build equity, we will invest in the 
financial stability of our low-income 
households. We will work to narrow 
the digital divide to lower the barrier 
to workforce participation. We will 
continue to invest in homicide reduction, 
public safety, and social cohesion. We 
will continue to improve the health 
of our communities and expand 
access to affordable housing through 
integrated policy and investment. 

TRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS
We are a dynamic and prepared city. 

We are building a New Orleans for the 
future—one that embraces change, 
prepares for the risks of the future, and 
honors our traditions. To achieve this 
vision, we must not only adapt, we must 
transform. Through better management, 
coordination, and service delivery, we 
can unlock value by improving daily life 
while also preparing the city as a whole 
for future shocks. By modernizing our 
operational systems, we will better equip 
residents and businesses to evolve from 
consumers of public services to partners 
in addressing shared challenges. 

We propose to achieve this by 
redesigning our regional transit systems 
to connect people, employment, and 
essential services. We will promote 
sustainability as a growth strategy, 
seeking ways to increase energy 
efficiency and renewable energy sources. 
This strategy calls for investment to 
increase the redundancy and reliability 
of our energy infrastructure with 
microgrids. The City of New Orleans 
will establish the Mayor’s Office 
of Resilience and Sustainability to 
integrate resilience-driven decision 
making across public agencies and 
the Center for Resilience to deliver the 
outreach and education components 
of building community resilience. We 
will develop a pre-disaster plan for 
post-disaster recovery that prepares 
the city to rebound quickly and

Shaping the Future City

New Orleans is becoming a global leader in resilience thinking 
and action. We are moving beyond our recovery to focus on our 
future, and this strategy outlines many deliberate steps forward. 
We are now stronger, more knowledgeable, and more innovative 
than ever before. We are positioned to build the future city: one 
that is responsive to our delta and coastal geography, locally 
forged and globally connected, and founded on the equity of 
opportunity and social mobility. While our challenges are many, 
our will and capacity to act have never been greater.

The children born in 2015 will be 35 years old in 2050. What 
we do today will help determine their future and the future of 
their city. The next generation will be more equitable, more 
adaptable, and more prosperous. As children, they will have 
better educational opportunities; as young adults, they will have 
better mobility throughout the region; and as adults, they will 
have better career opportunities and a safer city in which to raise 
their own families. 

When we imagine the future New Orleans, we see a dynamic 
urban landscape that is aligned with its natural environment—
we embrace living with water. We envision strong leadership 
from individuals, businesses, and public agencies that prioritize 
building city resilience. We see a city where every individual 
has access to the education, services, and resources needed 
to succeed; safe and affordable housing; employment; and the 
transportation to get there.

We are building the future New Orleans today.

Resilient New OrleansSHAPING THE FUTURE CITY

OUR RESILIENCE 
CHALLENGE

Many of the threats to New Orleans are 
not surprises to residents or visitors. 
The most prominent environmental 
shocks come in the form of severe 
storms or hurricanes and flooding 
events. The impacts from these events 
are only exacerbated by the presence 
of cumulative physical stresses, like land 
subsidence and coastal wetland loss, 
and social stresses, like poor economic, 
educational, and health outcomes among 
vulnerable populations.

City resilience is the capacity of 
individuals, communities, institutions, 
businesses, and systems within a city 
to survive, adapt, and grow no matter 
what kinds of chronic stresses and 
acute shocks they experience.

Our environment is changing.  
Climate change is accelerating it. 
New Orleans was founded in the 18th 
century due to its strategic location for 
commerce in the Mississippi River Delta 
and on the Gulf of Mexico. Today, the 
natural systems upon which the city was 
built continue to sustain the city, but also 
threaten it. The deltaic soils underfoot 
and the wetlands that largely surround 
the city are part of a shifting coastal 
landscape that offers unique challenges 
for the built environment. The natural and 
coastal systems of Southeast Louisiana 
are directly connected to the urbanized 
area of New Orleans, providing natural 

protections from storms and storm surge 
and creating landscapes for economic 
development.

Shocks like hurricanes are compounded 
by daily stresses on the city’s natural 
and built environment. The rapid loss 
of coastal wetlands puts extra stress 
on the city’s flood protection system, 
while hard surfaces that do not absorb 
water and sinking urban soils exacerbate 
flood risk from regular rainfall. Sea 
level rise and a projected increase in 
frequency and intensity of storm events 
are expected to accelerate coastal land 
loss, adding greater stresses to our 
levee and flood protection system, while 
more extreme heat will directly threaten 
other infrastructure systems and the 
health of our residents. We are already 
facing many climate change–related 
challenges in advance of other cities 
and regions around the world due to our 
unique geography.

City resilience is about more than 
building stronger infrastructure to hold 
back the water and withstand the wind. 
Our capacity to adapt is founded on 
our knowledge and learning from past 
experiences with shocks and stresses. 
However, some fundamental aspects of 
our existence as a coastal city have been 
hidden behind walls and under asphalt, 
including our slowly sinking deltaic 
soils and our disappearing wetlands. 
While we now may recognize the risks 
that a hurricane presents, we still lack 
a widespread public awareness of how 
climate change increases the future risks 
to our city. 

10

City of New Orleans 

We will continue to adapt to our semi-
aquatic home. With a comprehensive 
coastal master plan and implementation 
strategy, Louisiana is already taking 
action on coastal protection and 
restoration efforts. Today, New Orleans 
is ready to be an urban model for living 
with water and adapting to the rapid 
environmental changes that will only 
accelerate with climate change.  

Equity is critical to our resilience. 
Many New Orleanians suffer the chronic 
social stresses of poverty, unemployment, 
and violence. Wide disparities exist in 
employment and wages, educational 
attainment, and health outcomes. These 
social stresses are correlated with a 
greater vulnerability to physical shocks: 
low-income households in New Orleans 
are more likely to be located in areas 
at greater risk of flooding and land 
subsidence. These chronic stresses 
compound the risks of intermittent 
shocks, leaving our communities that 
already experience inequity further 
exposed to risk, and weakening our 
resilience as a city. 

Even as we look to the future, we cannot 
ignore past injustices. Racial inequity is 
present in every facet of our society—
employment and income, education and 
health, violence and justice, housing 
and social mobility. To advance as 
a city, we must confront this reality 
collectively and seek meaningful ways 
to address its effects in our institutions, 
our communities, and our families. With 
a strategy that prioritizes racial equity, 
we will be stronger as a society and more 
capable of responding to adversity.  

The future is uncertain.
As we seek to make resilience thinking a 
part of our daily practice, we must plan 
and prepare for a future that remains 
uncertain. Even in our recent history, new 
challenges have emerged. For example, 
following the levee failures and floods of 
2005, New Orleans spent years preparing 
for another major storm event, only to 
be shocked in 2010 by BP’s drilling rig 
explosion and oil spill—considered the 
largest environmental disaster in US 
history—which sent over 210 million 
gallons (780,000 cubic meters) of oil 
flowing across our coast. 

While not common to our city, other 
potential threats could include terrorist 
attacks, infectious disease epidemics, 
drought, and civil unrest. We might not 
know what shocks we will face, but we 
do know our future will be dynamic 
and complex. We need transportation 
systems that can get us to work every 
morning, but also move us to safety 
during a crisis. We need electricity and 
water systems that we can count on to 
keep us productive and that we know 
will perform under stress. We need a 
government that is agile enough to 
deliver critical services to all people in 
all conditions. By creating systems that 
are flexible enough to address multiple 
challenges and reliable enough to 
continue to support us, we can shape 
a city that can thrive no matter what 
may happen.

REGIONAL TRENDS

We have abandoned our long history of living 
with water. For the first two centuries of the 
city’s existence, we occupied the high ground 
nearest the Mississippi River and the natural 
ridges throughout the region. With the advent 
of highly efficient pumping technology in the 
early 20th century, the draining of swampland 
in low‑lying parts of the city and region 
incentivized new development to spread 
into previously uninhabitable locations. With 
this development came suburbanization 
and regional sprawl, setting the stage for 
challenges to our water management and 
flood protection systems, as well as to our 
ability to connect residents to regional 
job opportunities.

FROM STRATEGY TO IMPLEMENTATION

From Strategy  
to Implementation

STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

We developed this strategy by 
researching the challenges facing 
New Orleans, gathering input from 
stakeholders with relevant knowledge 
and expertise, and sourcing best 
practices from around the world. 
We investigated the city’s shocks, 
stresses, and assets. We met with local 
organizations and stakeholders to 
understand how the city’s resilience is 
perceived today, to gather local best 
practices, and to devise new approaches. 

Over 350 individuals participated 
throughout the process and provided 
valuable insight into what contributes to 
and detracts from the city’s resilience, 
what local expertise and knowledge 
exist, and what specific needs are not 
being met. In addition, the Office of 
Neighborhood Engagement convened  

a summit of neighborhood leaders to 
solicit perspectives on city resilience.

This research was then compiled in 
the Preliminary Resilience Assessment 
and grouped into focus areas. Working 
groups, composed of local and outside 
experts, met to further explore each 
focus area and propose potential 
approaches and solutions. This, in turn, 
led to a more detailed analysis of the 
opportunities within each focus area and 
resulted in more specific workshops on 
issues such as financing, risk modeling, 
and design. The proposals developed 
through this process directly inspired the 
actions set forth in this document.

addresses some long-term 
stresses, such as coastal 
erosion, subsidence, and 
drought.

FROM RECOVERY TO RESILIENCE

Over the past decade, we have undertaken extensive planning efforts to guide 
the recovery and rebuilding of our city and to envision the long-term future of 
New Orleans. We are moving beyond what was damaged in the past to look 
forward to the possibilities of the future. 

These planning processes have included broad and intensive outreach and 
engagement of residents, civic leaders, and experts across the city and beyond. 
This document does not represent another planning process—we do not seek 
to replicate the vast work that has been done over the past decade, or to 
create another plan. This strategy builds upon the existing visions by creating 
a series of short-term actions with long-term goals that provide a road map for 
implementation. In order to achieve this, we have reviewed previous work to 
understand the evolution of resilience planning that leads us to this integrated 
strategy today.

OUR APPROACH
Working to build resilience is different 
than conducting business as usual. It 
means breaking down traditional divisions 
between agencies and organizations 
to find common purposes. It means 
designing to deal with the next event 
rather than just assessing the last one. It 
means improving our cities today in ways 
that also make them better prepared for 
the risks of tomorrow. 

Our guidepost for designing a strategy 
that achieves these outcomes has been 
the City Resilience Framework. The 
framework, developed by Arup with 

support from The Rockefeller Foundation, 
is made up of four dimensions—Health 
& Well-being, Economy & Society, 
Infrastructure & Environment, and 
Leadership & Strategy—and is further 
defined by 12 drivers of resilience. We 
used the framework throughout the 
process to assess the connections 
between our challenges, identify critical 
areas of weakness, and develop actions 
that build upon our strengths. We 
also used the framework to facilitate a 
comprehensive discussion of resilience 
with our stakeholders. 

100 Resilient Cities 
- Pioneered by The 
Rockefeller Foundation 
(100RC) helps cities 
around the world 
become more resilient 
to the physical, 
social, and economic 
challenges that are a 
growing part of the 
21st century. 100RC 
provides this assistance 
through funding for a 
chief resilience officer 
in each member city to 
lead resilience efforts; 
resources for drafting 
a resilience strategy; 
membership in a global 
network of peer cities to 
share best practices and 
challenges, and access 
to a variety of resilience 
tools, including the City 
Resilience Framework. 
New Orleans was one 
of the first members 
of the 100 Resilient 
Cities Network, and 
Resilient New Orleans 
was supported by the 
100RC process.

City of New OrleansThe Resilience Dividend

By using this approach to evaluate and 
set priorities, New Orleans will achieve 
the Resilience Dividend: Instead of 
investing to reduce impacts from a single 
hazard or improve a single metric, the 
city will make strategic decisions to 
improve its overall strength and endure 
multiple shocks and stresses. Investing 
in resilience can save money, save 
lives, and build a more equitable and 
prosperous city. 

 

At each stage of the process, we 
also relied on the qualities of resilient 
systems as a touchstone to guide 
the development of our actions. We 
continually sought strategies that were: 

•  Reflective: informed by our past 

experiences 

•  Resourceful: made efficient use of our 

limited resources and attracted new 
resources  

•  Robust: were designed to be strong 

but also could fail safely

•  Redundant: had backup or spare 

capacity when needed 

•  Flexible: had alternative paths to 

achieve the same outcome 

•  Inclusive: involved those who bear risk 

and responsibility 

•  Integrated: coordinated across public 

and private organizations to achieve 
common purposes  

An example of the Resilience Dividend in action

Developing a reliable and comprehensive multimodal 
transit network will help New Orleans be more 
resilient whether the challenge is to be efficient 
and coordinated in times of emergency response, 
to enable low-income families to connect to 
opportunity, or to improve safety and connectivity. 
The point of entry might seem like a single 
infrastructure project, but it has the potential to 
create benefits across sectors, scales, and potential 
shocks. This is the Resilience Dividend in action.

challenges.

The principles and actions outlined in 
this strategy are designed for results and 
immediate benefits, but with long-term 
aspirations founded on the concept of 
generational change. 

The City will develop indicators and 
targets to track the progress of this 
strategy. The Office of Performance and 
Accountability (OPA), which promotes 
better city services through data-driven 
management, decisionmaking, and 
accountability, will support the Mayor’s 
Office of Resilience and Sustainability  to 
develop and track these measures. The 
City will make the data available publicly 
through ResultsNOLA, its quarterly 
reporting program for performance 
management.

DEMONSTRATING 
GLOBAL LEADERSHIP
For centuries, we have demonstrated our 
ability to innovate and adapt in the face 
of major challenges, making New Orleans 
well known as a model of community- 
based recovery and resilience. Today, 
New Orleans is continuing to lead, serving 
as an urban laboratory for innovation 
and change, working to prepare for an 
unpredictable future, and remaining 
committed to the equitable adaptation 
and transformation of coastal cities 
worldwide.

As part of the growing 100 Resilient 
Cities Network, we have been able to 
connect with resilience leaders around 
the world to learn from their wisdom 
and experience, while also sharing our 
own. New Orleans was the site of the 
inaugural Chief Resilience Officer Summit 
in November 2014, where we had the 
opportunity to showcase our progress 
along with the challenges that remain. 
The summit reminded us that resilience as 
a practice should always be grounded in 
our everyday lives and that ideas for our 
collective future might not always come 

IMPLEMENTATION & 
MONITORING
Our strategies will only be as effective 
as our ability to act. This document 
serves as a focal point and initial work 
plan for taking action to build resilience. 
The newly formed Mayor’s Office of 
Resilience and Sustainability and the chief 
resilience officer will have responsibility 
for implementing the strategy by 
coordinating with partners and agencies. 
The office will advise the mayor on policy, 
guide prioritization, and provide regional 
leadership on resilience. To further 
integrate resilience into our regulations, 
policies, and practices, the office will 
work closely with the City Planning 
Commission and Hazard Mitigation Office 
to ensure consistency with the City’s 
Master Plan and Hazard Mitigation Plan. 

By coordinating regionally, we can solve 
immediate and long-term problems 
that no single municipality or parish 
can address. Single jurisdictions cannot 
effectively build better levee systems, 
restore the coast, create stronger 
economies, ensure safe and affordable 
housing for our workforce, or build a 
transportation systems that will serve 
us into the future. It is only through 
cooperation among cities and towns 
acting together as a region that we will

FROM STRATEGY TO IMPLEMENTATION City of New Orleansfrom the places we expect. As a global 
leader, we have a responsibility to seek 
wisdom and guidance from all continents, 
to listen to the stories of our peers, and 
to share our progress toward shaping the 
future city.

FUNDING
Funding for the actions and initiatives 
outlined in this strategy will be derived 
from various sources, including existing 
government budgets, new grants and 
revenues, philanthropic funds, and private 
partnerships. 

Leveraging and maximizing existing 
sources of funding is a top priority. 
Aligning the City’s budgetary priorities 
with the resilience strategy, by utilizing 
the resources we already have to achieve 
multiple benefits, is the first step to 
investing in a resilient future. Strategically 
programming new sources of funds, 
particularly those that can be targeted to 

build resilience, like RESTORE Act funds, 
the BP Settlement, Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard 
Mitigation Grant program, and the US 
Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) National Disaster 
Resilience Competition, will provide a 
down payment on our future.

Beyond locally controlled funds, the  
City of New Orleans will continue to 
partner with federal and state agencies 
on their projects that have a direct 
impact on the future of the city. An 
example is strengthening the partnership 
between the City and the Louisiana 
Coastal Protection and Restoration 
Authority (CPRA) on projects both 
inside the city and outside the city that 
have a direct impact on our resilience. 
In addition, where the actions in this 
resilience strategy are aligned with the 
investments and missions of our private 
sector partners, we will seek to expand 
the partnerships to support these 
initiatives. 

Leveraging one-time funding sources

In 2010, the Gulf Coast experienced the 
worst environmental disaster in US history 
after the BP oil rig explosion and spill. In 
July 2015, BP agreed to pay $18.7 billion in 
fines—the largest corporate settlement in 
US history. It is anticipated that $6.8 billion 
will be made available to the State of 
Louisiana, and $45 million to the City of 
New Orleans, to further a variety of coastal 
protection, remediation, and adaptation 
projects moving forward. This presents a 
prime opportunity for the state and city 
to operationalize resilience planning in 
coastal protection.

FROM STRATEGY TO IMPLEMENTATION Resilient New OrleansVISIONS AND ACTIONS

Visions and Actions

The following sections outline our many interconnected challenges and 
lay out strategic approaches and goals for each challenge. In order to 
achieve each goal, a series of strategic actions will be implemented, 
focused both on immediate results and generational change. The 
initiatives within these sections are both ambitious and pragmatic, 
both short term and long term. Most are new, while others are already 
succeeding, and we will seek ways to amplify their impact. Some will be 
implemented immediately, while others will need more study. However, 
they all have committed organizations and agencies, City support, and 
potential resources to pursue implementation.

•  Featured Actions are key initiatives for immediate implementation.

•  Supporting Actions are projects to be developed in the near future.

•  Ongoing Actions are examples of initiatives currently underway that 
demonstrate how New Orleans is already working to build resilience. 

•  Aspirations are the visions we hold for 2050 to guide our actions.

•  Resilience Values are the multiple benefits, both direct and indirect, 

that we stand to gain by taking these actions.

We recognize that becoming a truly resilient city will require significant 
investment in both time and resources. It will require the hard work of 
our public and private leaders, and each and every person who lives 
and works in our city. This document is a call to action—a statement 
of values that will evolve and focus our activities to build resilience for 
decades to come.

Resilient New OrleansIntroduction

By adapting our city to our natural environment 
and the increasing risks of climate change, we 
can create opportunities for all New Orleanians to 
thrive. Successful adaptation will mean creating 
resilient systems and a culture of environmental 
awareness among all New Orleanians. 

Throughout our city’s history, water has 
been essential to New Orleans’ existence 
but has also threatened it. The only 
constant in our natural environment 
since the city’s founding in 1718 has 
been change. New Orleans is built upon 
some of the newest land in the world—
the shifting soils of the Mississippi River 
Delta. Prior to the construction of major 
levees and flood control structures in the 
20th century, the Mississippi River spent 
more than 7,000 years changing course 
and depositing sand, clay, and silt along 
its banks to build the land around us. In 
the past 100 years, we have channelized 
the river, dug canals, laid pipelines, 
drained wetlands, and introduced invasive 
species—all to establish conventional 
settlement and commercial patterns on a 
challenging environment.

Largely due to our own influence, we 
have been losing the coastal wetlands 
that sustain us both physically and 
economically at a rate of more than 
16 square miles (41 square kilometers) 
per year. River levees deprive the delta 
of the necessary sediment to build new 
wetlands; canals and pipelines destabilize 
marshes, allowing exposure to damaging 
saltwater. Even in the city, the soft soils 
beneath us are not static. The ground 
in New Orleans is sinking—as much as 
10 feet over the past 100 years in some 
parts of the city. Known as subsidence, 
this process is partially a result of our 
practice of pumping water out of the 
city as quickly as possible, which dries 
and compacts the typically moist soil—
buckling streets, bursting pipes, and 
destabilizing utility poles.

Sea level rise and the increased frequency 
and intensity of extreme storm events 
are projected to accelerate coastal land 
loss, adding greater stresses to our levee 
and flood protection system, while more 
extreme heat will directly threaten other 
infrastructure systems, such as electricity 
distribution, and the health of our 
residents. New Orleans is arguably more 
threatened by global climate change 
than almost any other US city, but we are 
also more capable than ever to address 
its effects.

Louisiana will 
likely experience 
temperatures 
above 95˚F (35˚C)

and climate change. We must align our 
infrastructure and urban environment 
to the realities of our delta soils and 
geography. Rather than resist water, 
we must embrace it, building on the 
confluence of Louisiana’s culture, history, 
and natural systems. As we look to the 
wisdom of the past, we must also prepare 
for the risks of the future. 

The infrastructure of the future city will 
look different than it does today. Our 
parks and schoolyards will be designed 
with native plants and trees to soak up 
water; our canals and streets will provide 
greenways for recreation and water 
management. The infrastructure of the 
future New Orleans will work with natural 
systems, be redundant and reliable, 
provide multiple benefits to residents, 
and even beautify the city. 

“ This is a floating city,  
floating below the surface 
of the water.”

 

—  Benjamin Latrobe,  
describing New Orleans, 1819

Our adaptation must be both physical 
and behavioral. Our historical experience 
of living with water in Southeast 
Louisiana has been largely forgotten. 
Much of our water flows behind walls and 
through culverts, where we rarely see it. 
Despite being a place that is so defined 
by hydrology, we have systematically 
hidden water from our daily experience. 
We need spaces where we can regularly 
encounter the water that surrounds us, 
learn about how it shapes our city, and 
explore ways to manage its presence.

33

Resilient New Orleansthreatens us in Southeast Louisiana, and 
our understanding and stewardship of it 
will only become more critical. 

A resilient approach examines the 
relationship among critical systems 
and commits to collaboration between 
private, public, local, regional, and 
national actors. We have already 
begun to work together to protect and 
restore our coast. We are committed to 
comprehensive urban water management 
that will help us live with our abundance 
of water. 

We are building the future delta city. 
We have a responsibility to the next 
generation of New Orleanians to be 
reflective of our past and flexible in 
adapting our city and our lives to a new 
reality. We have a responsibility to the 
world to share our progress.

Generational change starts at a young 
age, with children being exposed to  
water during swimming lessons, in  
parks, and on neighborhood streets.  
For our students, incorporating our local 
geography and hydrology into formal 
education is essential to begin lifelong 
learning and engagement with the risks 
and opportunities of our collective future. 
With a new generation of emerging 
environmental stewards, we are poised 
to become a global leader in sustainable 
environmental management. 

Being ready for a dynamic future 
economy will be an important outcome  
of our successful adaptation. Building 
new types of infrastructure and 
retrofitting conventional systems 
is already growing our local water 
economy. More than 14,000 new water 
management jobs have been added to 
our region since 2010, with more growth 
projected. 

Our future in the Mississippi River Delta 
will inevitably be wet—with less land 
around us and more intense storms 
projected—and in order to thrive and 
prosper we need to accept water and 
transform how we manage it. Our 
dynamic environment both sustains and

Credit: CPRA

To improve the flood protection provided by coastal wetlands, 
New Orleans will support the efforts of the Louisiana Coastal 
Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) by leveraging financial 
resources available through the BP settlement, the National Disaster 
Resilience Competition, and the RESTORE Act. In partnership with the 
CPRA, the City will help advance coastal restoration and protection 
projects in Orleans Parish that benefit the city of New Orleans and 
the region, providing flood protection, habitat restoration, and 
workforce opportunities. 

The Coastal Master Plan’s risk reduction targets of “500-year” 
storm protection can only be achieved through a combination of 
“structural” flood protection, such as levees and coastal restoration, 
and “nonstructural” approaches, including home elevations and flood-
proofing measures. New Orleans will be the model for combining 
these approaches through the development of coastal projects and 
complementary urban water management strategies and the reduction 
of risk by adapting the urban environment.

Our Disappearing 
Coast

 

Coastal land lost since 1932:  
1,900 mi2 (4,920 km2)

Projected land loss by 2060, 
without action:  
1,806 mi2 (4,677 km2)

The channelization of the Mississippi River 
deprives Southeast Louisiana of the sediment 
that builds coastal wetlands, while the oil 
and gas, shipping, and logging industries 
have caused severe damage to make way 
for pipelines and canals. This damage causes 
saltwater intrusion that further degrades our 
natural ecosystem and exacerbates the effects of 
storms. Because coastal wetlands reduce storm 
surge and tropical storm intensity, their loss puts 
the city’s flood protection system and national 
economic assets at risk. The coast also supports 
numerous communities, wildlife and recreational 
areas, and industries that depend on its health 
for their survival.

Rain gardens and home elevations, seen here in the Lower Ninth Ward, are examples of ways 
homeowners can invest in risk reduction.

New Orleans will develop a resilience retrofit program to provide 
incentives for property owners to reduce their own risk. The City is 
exploring the use of innovative financial instruments to launch the 
program, including the Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) 
program. PACE is a voluntary program in which property owners can 
make energy efficiency improvements at little or no upfront cost, with 
loans repaid through property tax bills for up to 20 years. Low‑interest 
capital and a potential reduction in insurance premiums will serve 
as incentives to property owners to invest in storm resilience 
improvements such as elevation, floodproofing, storm shutters, and 
stormwater management features.

CHALLENGE IN CONTEXT

Living with flood risk  
As wetlands were drained 
in the 20th century to make 
way for urban development 
and federal flood insurance 
became widely available, more 
households and businesses 
were constructed in flood-
prone areas. Due to real estate 
policies that reinforced racial 
segregation and historic 
settlement patterns tied to 
topography, people of color 
and lower-income residents 
are today more likely to live 
in low-elevation areas at 
greater risk of flooding and 
subsidence.

Resilient New OrleansCRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Critical infrastructure in New Orleans is more than just levees, bridges, and canals. It is a complex series 
of interdependent built and natural systems that keep our coastal city safe, productive, and healthy. 
Part of a resilient approach to infrastructure is an accurate understanding of the full geographic and 
functional breadth of these systems and the connection between our built urban environment and the 
managed landscapes that surround us. 

Shocks like hurricanes have cascading effects on the city’s critical infrastructure systems. When one 
system is compromised, it negatively impacts the function of other critical systems. For example, a 
power outage during a storm may compromise the function of the energy-intensive pumping stations, 
resulting in severe street flooding. We recognize the interdependence of these systems and are 
committed to their comprehensive management and adaptation to future conditions. 

Infrastructure—such as reliable and affordable transportation and communication networks—is not just 
critical for protection against shocks, but also for supporting economic growth and stability, providing 
reliable service delivery, and enabling equitable access to opportunity for all New Orleanians.

Inspiration from Rotterdam
Living and designing with water

The Netherlands, a country situated primarily below sea level, has 
always been at the forefront of innovation in water management, with a 
thousand-year history of building dikes and other control structures to 
protect against flooding. But with climate change, the country is seeing 
rising seas and heavier storms further challenge its ability to live with water. 
The city of Rotterdam has chosen to tackle the threats associated with 
impending climate change and flooding risks by embracing it as a chance to 
strengthen the main ambitions of the city. Surrounded on all sides by water, 
the Dutch delta city is looking to design innovations that turn the city into 
a sponge, creating countless spaces for absorbing and storing rainwater, 
including water plazas, green roofs, and even a water storage facility in an 
underground parking garage. These spaces not only reduce flooding in the 
city, but also connect water to opportunity, recreation, and beautification. 
As global leaders in living with water, the Dutch are exporting their 
expertise to other cities facing threats from climate change and sea level 
rise, creating jobs and growing their economy as a result. 

For the Dutch, learning to live with water and adapting to a changing delta 
environment start at a young age. Children’s books depict lessons about 
canals, and students compete in state-sanctioned sand castle building 
competitions coached by expert engineers to see whose structures 
can withstand the tide the longest. Water is ubiquitous in the lives of 
Rotterdammers, who every day cross scenic canals that flow through their 
city. Environmental awareness and education are deep and ongoing—as 
critical to the city’s future as floodwalls and water plazas.

We will actively facilitate connections that prioritize the development 
of environmental stewardship and disaster readiness in our region’s 
students. The City will partner with organizations already serving 
as hubs for experiential learning about the environment and 
preparedness and support content development with the best 
information available about our changing environment. Going beyond 
the inclusion of geography as a curriculum element, we seek expand to 
opportunities to experience the power of water and our environment 
across in-classroom subjects and in the wider city-as-laboratory. 
For example, Ripple Effect partners with teachers, designers, and 
water experts to rethink in-school science education. Around the city, 
students engage in site-specific design challenges that also meet 
national science standards. 

We recognize the need for physical sites outside of schools for students 
and educators alike to interact and learn about how we live with water. 
As an example, the Louisiana Children’s Museum is committed to being 
a space for environmental education and experiences for children 
and adults—with a focus on all the ways we live with water in coastal 
Louisiana.

New Orleans is arguably more affected by climate change than any 
other US city, and while we are committed to adapting to our changing 
environment, we also share a responsibility to mitigate our impacts 
on climate change. New Orleans will join the growing international 
movement that seeks to limit our collective contribution to global 
climate change. We will set aggressive greenhouse gas reduction 
targets for 2050 and implement a plan to achieve them.

We will begin by determining our baseline emission levels, and then we 
will identify specific strategies to reduce them. The plan will set forth 
multiple strategies for reducing our climate impact, including transit 
improvements, land use policy changes, investments in alternative 
energy and energy efficiency, and greening and conservation projects. 
We will then monitor our progress against measureable goals. The 
climate action plan will augment our climate adaptation measures 
already underway. Many of our climate adaptation strategies, such 
as wetland restoration, green infrastructure, and transportation 
improvements, will also have mitigation benefits.

Dependence on Fossil Fuels 

Every year Louisiana provides the US with more oil and gas than we import from Saudi Arabia.  
The extraction of fossil fuels has been critical to our region’s economy for the past century. 
Thousands of Louisiana families rely on jobs in the oil and gas industry. But the blessing of 
abundant natural resources can also be a curse. Tens of thousands of miles of pipelines cut 
through our marshes, exacerbating coastal land loss, and fossil fuels are the primary producers 
of climate change–inducing greenhouse gases. As a region, we have been slow to shift our 
consumption and our economic drivers away from traditional energy sources like oil and gas  
and toward adopting large-scale renewable energy.

Resilient New OrleansIntroduction
By investing in equity, we are investing in 
resilience. Equity will be the driving force 
behind our economy’s growth and innovation, 
our communities’ safety and stability, and our 
families’ health and prosperity. 

New Orleans’ economic recovery 
and growth in recent years has been 
remarkable. Despite the enormous 
impacts from the floods of 2005, the 
global financial crisis, and the BP oil spill, 
New Orleans has continued to recover 
its population, add jobs, and keep 
overall unemployment lower than most 
cities around the country. Furthermore, 
new businesses are forming at a rate 
well above the national average, and 
New Orleans has been recognized 
nationally as a top location to start and 
grow a business. But this revitalization 
has not benefited everyone and in many 
cases has even furthered inequity.

While the majority of New Orleanians 
are African American, most low-income 
households and people of color have not 
shared in the recent economic growth 
and prosperity. Wages have declined 
when adjusted for inflation. Income 
inequality has grown. Joblessness 

exceeds 50 percent among African-
American men. Minority-owned 
businesses compose 27 percent of 
total firms in metro New Orleans but 
receive just 2 percent of total business 
receipts. The effects of workforce 
inequality extend beyond the worker 
or job seeker. Today in New Orleans, 
39 percent of children and 27 percent of 
all New Orleanians are living below the 
poverty line. Wide disparities in public 
health outcomes exist, including higher 
rates of heart disease, diabetes, and 
cancer, and lower life expectancies for 
African-American residents compared to 
white residents. 

We are actively working to address 
these inequities with a comprehensive 
set of projects and initiatives that 
reduce violence, build healthy and 
stable communities, connect workers 
to opportunities, and increase wages 
and improve livelihoods. However, even 
as we look to build equity in the future, 
we cannot ignore past injustices and 
our city’s legacy of inequity. Racial and 
economic inequity is present in every 
facet of our society and threatens our 
resilience as a city. We must meaningfully 
address this challenging reality and its 
effects in our systems, our institutions, 
and our communities. 

The Opportunity of Growing Industries

Southeast Louisiana is fast emerging as a leader in the environmental 
services sector, but sustained growth and benefits to our local 
workforce and economy are not inevitable. We need to continue 
to foster local business growth and local hiring practices to create 
more local job opportunities and keep wealth in our communities. 
Greater New Orleans, Inc, the regional economic development 
alliance, is committed to further developing the emerging water and 
environmental services sector, with a goal of Southeast Louisiana 
becoming a global hub of businesses that profitably manage 
environmental issues and challenges. At the same time, the City 
of New Orleans is working to prepare the local workforce for the 
dynamic industries of the future city, especially as we embrace living 
with water.

City of New Orleans

VISIONS AND ACTIONS CONNECT TO OPPORTUNITY 

Our dynamic economy requires an 
adaptable workforce with the skills 
and training needed to pivot to new 
industries. We witnessed the impacts of 
economic shifts when modernization in 
the shipping industry and an economic 
downturn in the petroleum industry 
left generations of workers behind. 
We have to prepare today’s workforce 
for emerging industries and connect 
New Orleanians to the opportunities of 
the 21st century. 

Access to opportunity comes in many 
different forms. It means providing 
sector-specific technical training and 
“soft skills” development. It also means 
partnering with our anchor institutions 
and emerging industries to change hiring 
practices and strengthen employment 
opportunities for local job seekers and 
small businesses. Reliable and affordable 
childcare, physical and behavioral 
health care, and transportation are also 
fundamental to connecting potential 
workers to employment. 

We are working to increase household and 
family stability since it directly influences 
our ability to succeed. Trauma and severe 
stress interfere with learning. Housing 
instability and poor health threaten careers 
and frequently result in debt. Incarceration 
often leads to further crime rather than to 
rehabilitation. Hopelessness can be more 
harmful than a hurricane. 

By investing in the safety, stability, 
health, and housing of our communities, 
New Orleans can create connections to 
opportunity that did not exist previously. 
The economic growth that can be realized 
from investing in our people is an example 
of the Resilience Dividend. Just as we 
must adapt our city to align with the 
environment, so too must we shift the 
landscape of opportunity toward  equity. 

“ There can be no renewal  
of our relationship with  
nature without a renewal  
of humanity itself.”

while growing our overall economy in  
an equitable way. 

54

Building on the model of the Individual Development Account, a 
savings-matching program for low- and moderate-income earners to 
set aside funds for emergency uses will be launched. A lack of access 
to savings poses a threat to many New Orleanians in times of crisis. 
By building savings for emergency purposes, New Orleanians will be 
better prepared to handle unexpected costs. The program will provide 
an entry point to banking for the many unbanked and under-banked 
individuals in New Orleans, making them less susceptible to predatory 
lending and costly financial products. The emergency accounts will 
be complemented by an effort to empower individuals and families to 
become more financially literate. Financial education efforts will focus 
on understanding credit, banking, and investment strategies.

The Network for Economic Opportunity 
(the Network) focuses on connecting 
disadvantaged job seekers and 
businesses to opportunities. Since 
launching in 2014, the Network’s key 
initiatives have included:

•  Policy improvements, such as 

strengthening enforcement and 
compliance with the disadvantaged 
business enterprise (DBE) program 
and executing a local hiring initiative  
to employ residents 

•  Opportunity centers, where workforce 

development organizations provide 
foundational skill development 

•  Case management and supportive 

services

•  Sector-specific job training to increase 

opportunities through partnerships 
with large employers and projects 
including the new airport terminal, new 
hospitals, and the Sewerage & Water 
Board of New Orleans 

The water management sector in 
Greater New Orleans is one of our 
fastest-growing fields. With over 14,000 
new water jobs added since 2010, the 
region is now beginning to face a skilled 
labor shortage, particularly among the 
local workforce. The Network has forged 
a partnership with Delgado Community 
College’s Water and Wastewater 
Treatment Program and the Sewerage 
& Water Board to train certified water 
infrastructure personnel, creating direct 
local career pathways in advanced 
manufacturing. We will continue to 
increase the impact of these specialized 
training programs to connect our local 
workforce to the growing opportunities 
of the future economy.

Anchor industries in our region offer 
quality jobs with career potential. The 
Network is engaging the leadership 
of these industries to strengthen 
employment and procurement 
opportunities for area job seekers and 
small businesses. The Network is also 
exploring models for worker-owned 
cooperatives that could provide anchor 
institutions large-scale, locally procured 
services and enterprises that produce 
and keep wealth within our communities. 
Local hiring and purchasing commitments 
are not the only ways in which anchor 
institutions can maximize their positive 
impact on the local community, but they 
are essential to increasing equitable 
access to livable wages and careers.

Inspiration from Mexico City  
Comprehensive solutions for improving health

In 1992, the U.N. called Mexico City the “most polluted city on the planet.” Poor air quality 
had catastrophic effects on the health and opportunity of its residents—leading to tens of 
thousands of hospitalizations each year and causing schools and offices to close on unsafe air 
days. Since then, the city has become a leader in environmentalism with bold and innovative 
approaches to regulation, smart design, and building awareness. 

Mexico City closed down or moved high-polluting industries, required gasoline to be 
reformulated, and introduced a program called “Hoy No Circula,” which requires commuters 
in private cars to stay off the road one day per week. These regulations have been supported 
by smart design and resource-efficient systems, including expanded subway networks, bicycle 
sharing, zero-emission bus corridors, and a design for the city’s new airport that includes park 
spaces called “lungs” that reduce and absorb air pollutants. Recognizing a need for cultural 
changes, the city developed various outreach programs to inform people about the problem 
and invite them to act. The city’s air quality home page, which receives upward of 50,000 
visitors a day, shares real-time data and resources with residents. 

While Mexico City can still further reduce harmful air pollutants, many have recognized the 
great strides the city has taken over the past two decades toward improving health and quality 
of life for residents. In 1992, Mexico City had only eight days with air quality considered “good.” 
In 2012, that number had improved to 248.

Inspiration from Medellín 
Integrated infrastructure for opportunity 
and hope 

In recent years, Medellín, Colombia, has become known as a 
global model for confronting city violence, polarization, and 
social inequity. For a place that was once known around the 
world for its drug cartels and incredible rates of violence—
in excess of 5,500 murders per year in the early 1990s—
Medellín’s success is truly remarkable. By investing in its most 
disadvantaged neighborhoods and directly connecting them by 
transit to new opportunities, Medellín has transformed itself and 
the lives of countless residents. 

The most striking example of infrastructure improvements takes 
the form of the Metrocable—a gondola system that connects 
some underserved and formerly isolated hillside neighborhoods 
to the commercial and industrial opportunities of the valley. 
The transit expansion was not completed in a vacuum, however. 
Complementary investments have also been made in the form 
of integrated public libraries, community centers, and parks 
that improve the social and physical landscape of those areas 
most affected by violence in the past. Perhaps most importantly, 
meaningful attention and investment have been given to 
communities that have felt overlooked in the past, improving 
trust and a sense of pride. 

These new additions have not only reshaped the urban 
environment in a beautiful way, but can also be credited with 
helping to drastically lower the city’s crime rate. By 2013, the 
city reported a reduction in its murder rate by a factor of 10 
compared to the 1990s.

and with access to jobs, services, and neighborhood 
amenities that support their families and well-being.

This policy is based on a multilayered approach 
of increasing the supply of affordable housing 
through the strategic use of financial subsidies 
and development incentives while building the 
skills of residents and the capacity of small and 
disadvantaged business enterprises to take 
advantage of the growing number of quality, 
high-wage jobs and contracting opportunities  
in the metropolitan area. 

This policy builds on the work of the past decade, in 
which local, state, and federal government agencies, 
through significant coordination and in partnership 
with non-profit and for-profit housing developers, 
have already made significant investments in 
affordable housing, developing nearly 5,000 
affordable rental units, completing 637 housing 
renovations for low-income homeowners, and 
building 551 permanent supportive housing units. 
Additionally, four major public housing developments 
have been completely redeveloped as mixed-income 
communities, transforming those neighborhoods and 
improving the surrounding area.

Unaffordable Rent

More than half of all New Orleans 
households rent, compared to 
roughly a third of households 
nationally. Over the past decade, 
rents have been rising faster 
than incomes, resulting in a rising 
number of households paying 
more than 30 percent of their 
incomes in rent—considered 
unaffordable by federal standards. 
Lack of affordable housing forces 
many households to move to more 
affordable areas in the region, 
where public transit options to 
employment are less accessible.

Resilient New OrleansIntroduction

We are building a New Orleans for the 
future—one that embraces change, prepares 
for the risks of the future, and honors our 
traditions. To achieve this vision, we must not 
only adapt, we must transform. 

Our future city will be one in which we 
live with water, invest in opportunities, 
and prepare ourselves for whatever 
unforeseeable challenges we may face. 
In order for people to connect to the 
opportunities of the future, we need 
modern and efficient transportation 
options to get workers to jobs and 
students to school. In order to bounce 
back from future shocks, we must 
prepare our city, neighborhoods, and 
businesses. In order to reduce our 
reliance on fossil fuels and join the 
global community in mitigating climate 
change, we must invest in renewable 
energy sources and design for greater 
efficiency. 

Shocks threaten our existence and 
complicate our daily lives. Sometimes 
they come in the form of a hurricane, 
while other times an electrical surge 
interrupts our access to clean water. 

Our city has faced significant shocks 
over the past decade in the form of 
infrastructure failures, floods, recessions, 
oil spills, and storms. While we cannot 
predict exactly what future challenges 
are ahead or when they may come, we 
can be certain we will face them. Planning 
and preparing for future shocks is critical. 
This means making sure small businesses 
have tools to open sooner after storms. It 
also means developing a plan in advance 
for how we will recover our critical 
infrastructure, deliver social services, 
and rebuild our homes after a disaster. 
By planning in advance of a major 
shock, we can accelerate the recovery 
process, make more efficient use of 
scarce resources, and reduce the overall 
economic and social impact to the city.

VISIONS AND ACTIONS TRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS 

In order to be a city that supports 
the health, safety, and prosperity of 
its people, we need systems that are 
reliable—both in times of crisis and in 
our daily lives. A comprehensive and 
efficient transit system is key to creating 
opportunities for social mobility. In order 
to be an equitable city, it is imperative 
that we invest in a multimodal regional 
transportation system that connects 
people to jobs, education, services, and 
recreation. 

Part of reliability is an understanding of 
where redundancy is most appropriate—
knowing where backups can ensure the 
continuity of our most critical services.  
By creating redundancy in the electrical 
grid, we can reduce downtime at 
facilities like hospitals and pumping 
stations, thereby limiting the potentially 
devastating impact of electrical outages. 
By reducing the rate of increasing 
demand through energy efficiency 
measures and diversifying production 
sources through renewable energy, 
we can reduce our impact on the 
environment.

During the past five years, the vast 
majority of basic municipal services 
and structures have been updated or 
transformed. Our work is not done. In 
order to be resilient, city government 
cannot simply provide basic public 
services but must also make these 

delivery systems flexible to future 
needs, robust and redundant in the face 
of shocks, integrated across agencies 
and departments, and responsive 
to community concerns. The public 
and private sectors must incorporate 
resilience thinking into decision-making 
processes to ensure that investments are 
strategic, create multiple benefits, and 
have a view to the future. 

Through better management, 
coordination, and service delivery, we 
can unlock value by improving daily life 
while also preparing the city as a whole 
for future shocks. By modernizing our 
operational systems, we will better equip 
residents and businesses to evolve from 
consumers of public services to partners 
in addressing shared challenges.  

Our delta city is already defined by its 
dynamism, and our future will only be 
more complex. We need to prepare now 
by building systems that are flexible 
enough to respond to changing demands 
and conditions. Transforming city 
systems is about taking action today to 
build the city of tomorrow.

“ Planning is most effective 
when it is practiced in 
advance.”

FEATURED ACTION

Redesign regional  
transportation 
systems

Lead: City of New Orleans,  
Regional Transit Authority
Partners: Ride New Orleans, Bike Easy 

ASPIRATION 

New Orleans is a car-optional city 
with an integrated, efficient, and 
reliable multimodal regional transit 
system, prioritizing connections 
to employment and focusing on 
pedestrian and bicycle safety.

RESILIENCE VALUE 

By investing in a robust world-class 
transit system, we will be more 
equitable, be more economically 
competitive, reduce our environmental 
impact, and support growth.

68

The City will hire a Transportation Coordinator to facilitate a transit 
system redesign and implementation strategy to connect people, 
employment, and services. The City will lead by example in promoting 
mass transit use by providing public employees with a pre-tax 
transit pass.

The City of New Orleans will work with the Regional Transit Authority 
(RTA), neighboring jurisdictions, local advocacy organizations, and 
national experts to develop a multimodal regional transit vision. We 
will work together to create a detailed road map to guide investment 
in service improvements and expansion today and in the future, with 
a view to developing a comprehensive regional network. Establishing 
critical linkages between regional economic development projects 
and employment centers, such as the UMC-VA Medical Center and 
Louis Armstrong International Airport, identifying potential bus rapid 
transit (BRT) corridors will help guide early planning efforts. Our 
future multimodal transit system will integrate bicycle and pedestrian 
networks, with a “Vision Zero” goal of no pedestrian or bicycle 
fatalities on city streets. 

City of New OrleansVISIONS AND ACTIONS TRANSFORM CITY SYSTEMS 

Our jobs are regional,  
but our transit system is not.

New Orleans was late to create a regional transit authority, doing so only in the late 
1970s and early 1980s, and the effort was curtailed from the outset by the decision by 
surrounding parishes to withdraw from the Regional Transit Authority. While any efforts 
at regional transit floundered, the RTA operated an efficient and widespread system—
primarily based on bus service—that served the entire city with frequent and dependable 
routes until the eve of Katrina.  

However, since Katrina, New Orleans’ transit system has only regained 45 percent of the 
level of bus service, and the operating budget for the RTA has been reduced by almost 
40 percent. Service reductions have been worst in areas where transit is most critical: 
low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and areas where people lack access  
to personal vehicles.

Today, the region is lacking a comprehensive regional vision for transit 
service. Because of this, the city faces significant challenges in connecting 
residents to jobs and services, attracting new residents, and remaining 
competitive for scarce federal transportation funding.

100 RESILIENT CITIES NETWORK HIGHLIGHT 

Inspiration from Chicago
Leading by example on efficiency and sustainability

In 2000, Chicago built the city’s first green roof garden on City Hall to signal to residents 
and businesses the city’s commitment to sustainable strategies and to demonstrate 
the potential of innovative retrofits to Chicago’s historic building stock. This green roof 
reduces stormwater runoff, conserves energy, decreases the urban heat island effect, 
and improves air quality. Over the past 15 years, hundreds of property owners across 
Chicago have followed City Hall’s lead and installed green roofs of their own, supported 
by incentive programs for existing buildings and encouraged by “cool roof” regulations on 
new developments. 

When it comes to sustainable design, the City of Chicago continually leads by example. 
The City’s current Retrofit Chicago initiative is a coordinated, cross-sector plan to improve 
energy efficiency in municipal, commercial, and residential buildings across the city. Through 
creative financing strategies, the city is upgrading 60 municipal buildings—including libraries, 
police stations, and health care facilities—to reduce energy consumption and operating 
costs. In addition to public sector improvements, over 20,000 residential units have been 
upgraded, creating savings for renters and homeowners. Retrofit Chicago’s voluntary 
Commercial Buildings Initiative sets a goal of 20 percent energy use reductions in five years 
for participating buildings. Through these programs, buildings across the city are seeing 
gains in efficiency and savings on utility bills, while creating jobs and improving the city’s 
impact on the environment.

ASPIRATION

Greater New Orleans has a reliable 
and redundant energy production 
and distribution network that is able 
to meet and adapt to the increased 
demands and risks of the 21st century.

RESILIENCE VALUE 

By providing energy backup during 
shocks and outages for a variety of 
co-located critical infrastructures 
(e.g., pumping stations, hospitals, 
communications), we can support 
faster disaster response and recovery, 
and avoid losses of life and property.

72

Credit: NASA

The City of New Orleans is assessing the risks of energy outages 
to critical infrastructure systems and conducting feasibility studies 
for backup generation, or microgrids. Microgrids are small backup 
electrical generation and distribution systems that can disconnect 
from the traditional grid to operate autonomously and help mitigate 
the effects of outages. Microgrids can help strengthen grid resilience 
and support quicker system response and recovery. Microgrids also 
support a flexible and efficient electric grid by enabling the integration 
of renewable sources of energy. In addition, the use of local sources 
of energy helps reduce energy losses in transmission and distribution, 
further increasing efficiency of the electric delivery system.

We are highly dependent on the electrical grid, and a major outage 
can have severe consequences. Reliable power is especially important 
for infrastructure and critical facilities that support and protect public 
health and safety, including water and wastewater, police and fire, 
hospitals, and communications systems. Our city has multiple critical 
functions or services that are interdependent, such that a loss of power 
or energy to one facility or service will adversely affect other functions 
or operations. For example, loss of power to a water treatment plant for 
an extended period could reduce the ability to pump water, impacting 
not only public health, but also firefighting and water for industrial 
uses. Therefore, extended power outages can have cascading impacts 
or lead to a devastating chain of failures of critical services.

generation, we can reduce our environmental impact and 
lower our energy costs.

CHALLENGE IN CONTEXT

In August 2012, Hurricane Isaac 
brought high coastal surges,  
strong winds, and heavy rainfall, 
which persisted over the city for 
51 hours. Hurricane-force winds 
caused widespread power outages,  
leaving over 787,000 
customers without power  
in Louisiana.

Energy Vulnerability

Reliable energy is essential for the swift response and recovery of a city. Today, New Orleans’ 
households, businesses, infrastructure, and public facilities sometimes suffer electrical surges and 
outages. Climate change and rising temperatures are expected to increase electricity demand 
among New Orleanians and physical strain on infrastructure, causing increased vulnerabilities to 
the system. Likewise, warming temperatures are predicted to increase the strength and frequency 
of tropical storms, creating greater risk of damage to distribution lines.

When critical services like potable water, sewer systems, or drainage pumping stations are 
down due to power outages, even briefly, it can cause damage to infrastructure, economic 
losses to businesses, and hazardous public health consequences. In order to adapt to the more 
extreme conditions of a changing climate, greater capacity, efficiency, and redundancy must be 
incorporated into how we produce and consume power.

adaptive capacity and providing 
cross-sectoral benefits.  

The City of New Orleans will develop a comprehensive plan for

Partners: Swiss Re, Veolia

The City of New Orleans will conduct a thorough 
risk assessment of the city’s critical infrastructure to 
determine the exposures and the associated costs of 
disasters in various scenarios. With this assessment, 
the City will be able to isolate systems that are 
critical to continued livability of the city and have 
deployable private market assets prepared to repair 
and improve the system immediately after an event. 
Through this process, New Orleans will be positioned 
to be the first city to pre-fund the disaster resilience 
of its critical infrastructure using private market 
assets. Catastrophic losses will be pre-funded 
through the transfer of the risk to the private 
market. This will decrease the chances of sustained 
impairments to basic services and save the city and 
its residents substantial expense in the future while 
improving the speed of recovery.

Citywide Parcel and  
Building Survey

In order to assess risk and measure blight reduction, 
the City is developing a rapid method for surveying 
building conditions on every parcel in the city, 
capturing photography using car-mounted cameras 
and engaging community members to evaluate each 
parcel. Outside of crises, the property condition data 
can be used to develop strategies for risk reduction, 
code enforcement, and reuse of vacant property. 
After a disaster, the imagery can be quickly collected 
and used to rapidly assess recovery needs and 
support services, such as mobile first aid clinics, 
food and water distribution, and temporary housing. 
During disaster recovery, a citywide property 
condition census conducted at regular intervals 
can provide crucial progress updates and be used 
to strategically deploy public services and case 
management. Having comprehensive pre-storm data 
can facilitate more efficient reimbursement from 
FEMA and private insurers.

Resilient New OrleansACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Resilient New Orleans is possible because of the hard work and input of 
the many city staff members, community members, technical experts, 
and project advisors who participated in the development of this 
strategy to shape the future New Orleans.

This work would not have been possible without the tremendous 
support of The Rockefeller Foundation, and in particular the leadership 
and guidance of Dr. Judith Rodin, Patrick Brennan, Dr. Nancy Kete, and 
Sam Carter.

Special thanks to all our friends and colleagues at 100 Resilient 
Cities who made this strategy a reality, especially Michael Berkowitz, 
Bryna Lipper, Andrew Salkin, Leah Flax, and Max Young. 

We want to also thank the following Chief Resilience Officers who 
provided inspiration for this strategy: Cezar Busatto (Porto Alegre), 
Alessandro Coppola (Rome), Nicole Ferrini (El Paso), Greg Guibert 
(Boulder), Toby Kent (Melbourne), Arnoldo Matus Kramer (Mexico City), 
Arnoud Molenaar (Rotterdam), Christine Morris (Norfolk), Patrick Otellini 
(San Francisco), and Santiago Uribe Rocha (Medellín). 

Support was also provided by the Greater New Orleans Foundation; 
Louisiana Office of Community Development; Tulane University; Greater 
New Orleans, Inc; Iberia Bank; Jones Walker, LLP; Waggonner & Ball 
Architects; Young Leadership Council; and CityMart.

We want to thank the exceptional team at HR&A Advisors, who helped 
transform our collective thoughts into actionable goals and initiatives.
