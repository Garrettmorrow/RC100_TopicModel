MAYOR’S LETTER

Alhamdulillah, I would like to extend my gratitude to God Almighty for 
the completion of Semarang City’s Resilience Strategy Document as 
part of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative.

As a city, Semarang still faces a diverse range of issues. Tidal flooding 
and flash floods, sanitation and waste management, congestion, and 
unemployment, among others, are the issues the city currently dealt 
with. About five percent of the city’s population living in poverty is 
considered to be the most vulnerable to these problems. Therefore, a 
special attention is needed to this group of people.

During this time, the Semarang city’s government, together with all 
of the city elements, has tried to overcome these challenges, both 
through improved physical and non-physical infrastructures. The city 
has achieved and accomplished a lot, however, there is still much left 
to be done. For this matter, Semarang does not rule out the possibility 
to learn from other cities, either in the national or international levels. 
Further, Semarang’s participation in the 100 Resilient Cities network is 
expected to strengthen every effort the city makes in tackling these 
issues.

Mayor of Semarang

RESILIENT SEMARANGThere are 6 pillar strategies, 18 strategies, and 53 initiatives listed in this City Resilience 
Strategy Document. The strategy was formulated through an inclusive process involving 
many elements of the city. It is hoped that the document becomes one of the guidelines 
in implementing the concrete actions towards the resilient Semarang. These actions 
will not only be done by the agencies within the city government, but also by the entire 
community of Semarang. In addition, through a network built in the 100 Resilient Cities, 
it is also expected that there are opportunities to cooperate with other parties related to 
resources in order to build the city resilience, nationally and internationally.

A resilient city does not only mean as a city that can withstand the current challenges 
and adapt accordingly, but also as a city that can further develop better in the future. In 
this regard, all elements of the city have a significant role in creating the city resilience. 
Therefore, on this occasion I would like to invite all ‘sedulur-sedulur’ –brothers and 
sisters-- in Semarang to move together towards a resilient Semarang, with the ultimate 
goal of realizing the welfare of the whole society. As for the future, I hope that with this 
City Resilience Strategy Document, Semarang, along with all its challenges, can become 
a more resilient city and develop into a modern and sustainable city.

MOVING TOGETHER TOWARDS A RESILIENT SEMARANGLETTER FROM 100 RESILIENT CITIES 

Today, 100 Resilient Cities is proud to partner with the city of 
Semarang to release their Resilience Strategy: Moving together 
towards a Resilient Semarang.  For over four centuries, Semarang has 
been the focal point of trade in Indonesia, and a destination for people 
from all different backgrounds in the region. It takes a bold and honest 
view of the wide variety of challenges and opportunities the city 
faces, and brings together both existing and new resilience building 
initiatives while honoring the diversity that is a key characteristic of 
Semarang.  This strategy is the end result of a process that ensured 
participation from a broad range of stakeholders.  This strategy truly 
reflects Semarang as a whole- thoughtful, inclusive, and diverse and if 
implemented that process, along with the initiatives herein, will make 
the city better able to survive the shocks and stresses the city faces. 

We would like to thank Mayor Hendrar Prihadi for his continued 
partnership, and congratulate him on the release of this strategy.  
None of this could have happened without his strong commitment 
to support the resilience building efforts in Semarang, from the city’s 
engagement in the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network to 
the work we see before us today.  

We must also commend the entire Semarang resilience team, 
including Chief Resilience Officer Purnomo Dwi, and Wiwiek 
Handayani, Deputy CRO. Their tireless efforts and analytical thinking 
to produce this exemplary plan is already inspiring people in cities all 
across the world.  We expect the city will continue to be a leader in a 
global resilience movement that will revolutionize the way cities act, 
think, plan, and support their citizens.

RESILIENT SEMARANGThis document has 18 strategies and 53 initiatives, each of which were constructed to 
provide multiple benefits, realistic timelines, and project owners and supporters.  The 
fact that this document is so actionable is critical, because the need for resilience 
building has never been greater not only here in Asia but around the world. The 
challenges and pressures of climate change, urban density, social cohesion and 
overtaxed infrastructure will continue to confront cities and their leadership for the 
foreseeable future.  

Going forward, we could not be more excited to continue working with Semarang to 
support the implementation of key initiatives and solutions for the city and its citizens. 
With an engaged city leadership and the passionate resilience team, I am confident 
that Semarang will continue to leverage a wide range of local stakeholders and global 
partners to begin implementing the projects detailed within the strategy. Please accept 
my warmest congratulations on behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities and Rockefeller 
Foundation teams. We are looking forward to continuing our strong partnership with 
Semarang to achieve our shared vision of building more resilient cities.

MOVING TOGETHER TOWARDS A RESILIENT SEMARANGUrban resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, 
adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses 
and acute shocks they experience.

We believe in building our capacity to better strengthen our 
city resilience.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Semarang continues to transform. In the 
6th century, the coastline of Semarang 
was in the  Bergota area, about 4 km from 
the current coastline. The continuous 
sedimentation from upper area of 
Semarang expanded the coastline further, 
thus extending the inland area, which 
grew into a coastal city. Unfortunately, 
the current trend of sea-level increase 
presents future flooding risk to this area.

If Semarang’s physical transformation 
is highly dynamic, so are the challenges 
that come with it. The city is experiencing 
urbanization. Its population and urban 
sprawl continue to grow, especially to the 
south and the east. Regional dynamics 
also increasingly play a critical role. 
Therefore, it is necessary for Semarang to 
continue to adapt. 

Semarang must prepare to face these 
continuous changes and challenges. With 
support from 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) 
initiated by the Rockefeller Foundation, 
Semarang started the preparation of a city 
resilience strategy. 100RC has developed 
a comprehensive understanding of city 
resilience that is based on four dimensions, 
including (1) Health and Wellbeing, 
(2) Social and Economic Development, 
(3) Environment and Infrastructure and 
(4) Leadership and Strategy. All process 
is conducted in an inclusive manner to 
ensure ownership of the 100RC by various 
elements of city stakeholders.

12

RESILIENT SEMARANGMOVING TOGETHER 
TOWARDS A RESILIENT 
SEMARANG

The development of a city resilience 
strategy requires the participation of 
various city stakeholders, including 
government officials, academics, 
businesses, the youth and community 
representatives in managing the 
shocks and stresses in the city. The 
collaborative work between city 
stakeholders identified 53 detailed 
initiatives in achieving the shared vision 
of a “Resilient Semarang”. 

We believe in building our capacity to better 
strengthen our city’s resilience. Any efforts on 
improving our resilience in facing increasing 
shocks and stresses need to be supported 
by excellent capacity. Building capacity to 
increase empowerment and productivity in the 
government, communities and institutions will 
become a key aspect in many of our initiatives.

These initiatives fall under six pillars:

13

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY1.SUSTAINABLE WATER AND 
ENERGY

The risk of water scarcity in 
Semarang is increasing due 
to the expected rise of future 
water demand, topographical 
challenges with hilly terrain and 
drought. PDAM (the city-owned 
water company) continues to 
improve water access in the 
city; however, their coverage is 
still limited.  Another challenge 
is electricity distribution as 
blackouts occur frequently in 
the city.

Related to these challenges, 
Semarang identified that its water 
and energy consumption must 
be conducted sustainably. We 
believe this can be accomplished 
through a series of performance 
improvement actions of our 
water management systems 
by promoting innovations in 
water provision and fostering 
environmentally-friendly 
behaviors in the community.

Therefore, the provision of 
alternative water sources will 
be explored. These alternative 
sources include, among others, 
rainwater harvesting, upstream 
and watershed area conservation, 
desalination plant and advocacy 
to reduce the excessive 
groundwater use. Coordination 

with neighboring local authorities 
for water provision is encouraged 
as it is a regional issue. Relating 
to energy, the city plans to 
organize energy-saving campaign 
and green building campaign. 

2. NEW ECONOMIC 
OPPORTUNITIES

The unemployment rate in the 
city of Semarang exceeds the 
average rate in Central Java 
and national level. One of the 
causes is labor market gap where 
employment level does not meet 
the high number of job seekers.

In the past, Semarang’s 
industrial sector was dominant. 
However, trade and service 
sector gradually reduced 
the dominance of industrial 
activities. Semarang needs to 
creatively explore additional 
alternative economic resources 
to minimize the potential increase 
of unemployment. The rapid 
development of SMEs (Small 
Medium Enterprises) seems 
to have a potential capacity in 
becoming a future generator of 
economy and employment in 
Semarang. Market research will 
be conducted in parallel with the 
provision of SMEs’ trainings. 

such as urban farming, waste 
recycle and ecotourism are 
potential and will be encouraged. 
Traditional markets should 
also be revitalized, not limited 
only to physical improvements, 
but also extended to the 
management and capacity of 
quality control. Furthermore, 
research cooperation between 
the government, private 
sector, universities and NGOs 
in identifying new strategic 
economic sector must be 
encouraged.

By creating economic climate 
that allows the emergence of 
new opportunities, we believe 
that it will answer the economic 
and unemployment challenge 
in Semarang. Furthermore, 
Semarang will be able to secure 
the welfare of its citizens. 

3. READINESS FOR 
DISASTERS AND DISEASES 

Semarang is at risk of flooding, 
landslide, and dengue fever 
outbreak. The disasters also 
have a vast element; they are 
connected to regional issues and 
spatial planning issues and they 
involve various stakeholders.

Additionally, environmentally-
friendly business innovations 

The public must have better 
knowledge of these risks so 
they can be better prepared. 

14

RESILIENT SEMARANGDissemination of information 
about the risk of disasters 
and diseases to communities 
must be improved.  Also, the 
potential of applying the latest 
technology to reduce these risks 
will be explored. 

While natural causes, such 
as precipitation increase, 
contribute to flooding, urban 
waste materials might also 
become the cause of flooding. 
Therefore, urban sanitation 
system in Semarang must be 
improved.

Communal collaborative work 
for disaster preparation by 
disaster preparedness groups 
are proven to be effective 
and will be encouraged to be 
replicated. However, disaster 
prevention must also be 
coordinated on a regional scale 
and consider the challenges in 
regional spatial planning. 

The disasters and diseases 
pose a challenge in Semarang. 
The city must be ready to face 
this challenge to minimize the 
impacts. We plan to achieve 
this by taking several actions 
that are going to improve 
information sharing, innovation 
and collaboration in disaster and 
disease outbreak preparedness.

4. INTEGRATED MOBILITY

and strengthen the productivity 
and activities of the citizens. 

Traffic congestion in Semarang is 
inevitable due to the increase in 
private vehicles. Meanwhile, road 
expansion is very limited. The 
municipal government continued 
to improve the city transportation 
service with the provision of BRT 
(Bus Rapid Transit).  However, 
the institutional capacity and 
management of BRT must be 
improved. More integrated, better 
quality and more affordable 
service will interest people 
more into switching to public 
transportation. 

It can include, among others, 
the provision of school buses, 
improvement of pedestrian and 
bicycle path, expansion of BRT 
routes and improvement of bus 
stops. The network and traffic 
management of BRT and the 
traditional public transportation 
must also be improved in order to 
achieve a more efficient mobility 
network. 

Despite transportation is a 
regional issue, there was only 
minimal regional coordination 
and this must be improved in 
the future. Furthermore, better 
connection to major economic 
nodes and tourism attractions can 
improve the overall connectivity 

Better connectivity and 
institutional capacity of transport 
service has been identified as 
necessary. We plan to achieve 
this by taking several actions 
that are going to enhance the 
performance of mobility by 
improving the quality, quantity 
and the management system of 
public transportation, and also by 
promoting public transport to our 
community.

5. TRANSPARENT PUBLIC 
INFORMATION AND 
GOVERNANCE

The performance of Semarang 
development budget is still 
low, resulting to inefficient 
public services. Musrenbang 
(development planning forum), 
which serves as a participatory 
planning and budgeting platform, 
has been implemented, but it 
still has weaknesses, especially 
in its too rigid procedures and 
schedule. The performance 
of development planning and 
implementation can still be 
improved and realized by 
increasing the active role of 
participatory monitoring from 
communities.

15

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY6. COMPETITIVE HUMAN 
RESOURCES

Low quality of human resources 
and skill gap among job seekers 
contribute to the lack of 
competitiveness in the labor force 
in Semarang. The proportion of 
elementary and junior high school 
graduates is quite significant, 
while the proportion of graduate 
and diploma qualification is still 
low. However, labor market 
has improved regionally and 
even internationally with the 
launch of the ASEAN Economic 
Community. 

expected to reduce the gap in the 
labor market. Career information 
center that provides information 
about various career pathways 
and support job seekers to find 
the right employers and vice 
versa could be established.

We identified the need to 
connect citizen to new skills and 
knowledge. We believe we can 
fulfill the need by taking a series 
of actions which will increase the 
capacity of Semarang workforce 
by establishing information career 
centers and providing training, 
workshops and information about 
education.

Therefore, higher qualifications 
of labor are required in order to 
prepare Semarang workforce in 
facing these dynamic changes. 
Future Semarang workforces 
must be equipped early with 
information regarding the 
future job market or provision 
of scholarships and career 
consultancy support. 

Better cooperation between 
employers, academics and the 
government in Semarang is 

Better access to the city’s 
public information is required to 
improve the role of participatory 
monitoring by community 
members. Various city agencies 
also need to improve their data 
coordination and information 
integration. Not only that it will 
be beneficial for the community, 
integrated data will also support 
Semarang government in 
formulating effective policies with 
little or without overlap between 
government agencies.

Semarang identified that 
development program 
information must be made public 
transparently in order to improve 
the quality and performance of 
the program. We are optimist 
that we can achieve this by taking 
several actions under the strategy 
pillar of transparent public 
information and governance. 
These actions will enhance 
governance performance by 
improving participatory process 
and coordination system, and 
improve the public information 
system by providing integrated 
data

16

RESILIENT SEMARANGCreating a resilient city is a 
collective work. Future urban 
challenges are real, and caused 
by and affected everyone. Ideas 
and initiatives included in this 
strategy are expected to inspire 
the municipal government, 
citizens, business sectors and 
every other element in Semarang 
to acknowledge these challenges 
and participate in achieving a 
resilient city. 

Let’s move together to build of 
Resilient Semarang!

NEXT STEPS

Semarang must continue and 
extend the goal in becoming 
the city with adequate security, 
effective mobility and high 
capacity to the inhabitants and 
stakeholders. This is supported 
by the city’s participation in 
the 100RC network in which 
opportunities are open the city to 
collaborate with various cities and 
institutions on international scale, 
enhance our local knowledge 
and expertise in tackling urban 
challenges.

Semarang will become the first 
city in Indonesia to launch a 
Resilience Strategy. The launch 
is not the end but rather the 
beginning of the city in becoming 
more resilient. Participatory 
process during the CRS 
formulation must be maintained 
in the implementation phase.

WHY RESILIENT 
CITIES?

A resilient city is a city that continues to 
function in the face of various challenges 
and then able to recover, grow, and 
develop better. The people who live and 
work in a resilient city - particularly the 
poor and vulnerable - have the capacity 
to survive, adapt, and grow in spite of 
various shocks and stresses they must 
face.

Throughout the years, Semarang citizens 
have been building resilience in order 
to tackle challenges. For example, in 
managing tidal flooding, every year 
some coastal communities allocate their 
saving to increase the height of their 

houses. Tanjung Emas Port, located near 
these communities, built a higher new 
road to enable access during flooding, 
so that the port can still function when 
faced by shocks. The city authority 
also implemented innovative programs 
such as rain water harvesting, flood and 
dengue early warning system, mangrove 
reforestation and many more. In the 
process, we also invited multi-background 
stakeholders to give input, for example, 
by forming the Urban Development City 
Board, with members of experts from 
various backgrounds. However, with the 
increasing challenges in the future, there 
should be more things to be conducted.

26

RESILIENT SEMARANGAcute shock is a sudden and 
dangerous event that threatens 
the city. Example: earthquake, 
flash flood and disease 
outbreaks.

Chronic stress is a situation that 
weakens the daily or periodically 
functions of a city. Example: 
tidal flood, water scarcity.

challenges, such as climate change. 
Therefore, Semarang participation in 
100RC brings opportunities to combine 
our local context and expertise in facing 
various resilience challenges with shared 
lessons from international institutions 
and other cities in the 100RC network, 
supporting our efforts in improving 
Semarang resilience.

Semarang is the first city in Indonesia 
participating in the 100RC network, 
along with 64 other selected cities 
around the world. The combination 
of challenges and issues faced by 
Semarang,opportunities to improve 
andi commitment to increase resilience 
have provided a solid ground for the 
city’s participation in the 100RC work.
 
The 100RC organization was created 
by the Rockefeller Foundation and aims 
to help cities to be more resilient in the 
face of physical, social and economic 
shocks and stresses. Cities around the 
world are facing similar challenges 
especially with unprecedented global 

27

WHY RESILIENT CITIES?The 100RC started with the 
development of resilience strategy 
by applying the comprehensive “City 
Resilience Framework/CRF” approach. 
This approach is based on four 
important dimensions in the city system, 
which included 

(1) health and wellbeing, 
(2) economy and society, 
(3) environment and 
infrastructure, and 
(4) leadership and strategy. 

The strategy development process also referred to the principles 
of resilience qualities, in order to design resilience in city systems, 
services, and institution:

1. The inclusive process 
emphasizes the need for 
wider consultation and 
the nature of ‘mutual 
cooperation’ to create 
a sense of belonging, as 
well as their shared vision 
in building city resilience. 
Inclusiveness targets 
all elements of society, 
including vulnerable groups, 
persons with disabilities 
and it is more gender 
responsive.

2. Individuals or 
institutions that 
reflectively apply their 
past experience and 
extensive knowledge 
have the ability to 
identify, prioritize 
and plan for future 
anticipations or 
constantly changing 
trends.

3. The integrated 
process can unify 
systems and institutions 
and enable cooperation 
to achieve greater goals.

4. The existence of 
responsive oversight, 
transparency and control 
system enables fast actions 
and precise handling in the 
event of shocks or pressure.

28

RESILIENT SEMARANGPicture 1 
The Resilient City Framework

The CRF also covers 12 
drivers that collectively 
assessing the city’s 
strengths and weaknesses, 
and uncovering 
opportunities to address 
vulnerabilities.

5. A resilient city is 
resourceful, has sufficient 
resources also human 
resources who are 
competent to carry out the 
planned programs, have 
alternative and sufficient 
funding.

6. Robust designs, 
systems and assets 
are elements that 
are properly created, 
organized, and 
maintained that they are 
safe from damage in the 
face of shocks and can 
withstand pressure.

7. Redundancy refers 
to having capacity 
alternatives, substitution or 
diverse resources, providing 
the city with alternative 
strategies or other methods 
in the face of shocks and 
stresses.

29

WHY RESILIENT CITIES?ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

The resilience strategy document is 
expected to function as an initial step 
in achieving resilient Semarang. City 
resilience strategy will help in creating 
benefits with minimum investment or 
even to increase investments in the city. 
Other than that, city resilience strategy 
can minimize the costs resulting from 
shocks and stresses and invite the 
community to actively participate in city 
development. 

Semarang medium-term development 
planning cycle is every 5 years and 
is part of the 25 years long term 
development plan. The timing 
of Semarang resilience strategy 
development is in parrarel with the 
drafting of the 2016-2021 Semarang 
RPJMD (Medium-Term Development 
Plan). This makes the completion 
of city resilience strategy is in great 
momentum to better support the overall 
city development plan. The strategy and 
initiative in the Semarang City Resilience 
Strategy are expected to support 
and complement the programs in the 
RPJMD. The strategy also focuses on the 
directives of the 2005-2025 Semarang 
long-term development planning (RPJP), 
which include:

- Achieve cultured and quality 
  community life

- Achieve a more reliable government to   
  increase public service
- Achieve a dynamic and environmentally 
  insightful metropolitan city
- Strengthen people’s economy that is 
  based on local excellence and build a 
  conductive business climate.

This document can also be used as 
a proposal and investment tool of 
which can be proposed to obtain 
funding commitment unrelated to the 
government’s budget. Participation in the 
100RC enables Semarang to collaborate 
with international institutions and other 
cities in the 100RC network. The initiatives 
included in the city resilience strategy 
document can also be supported by 
the central or provincial government, 
or national or international donor and 
research institutions. 

Community, businesspeople and various 
stakeholders in Semarang are actors 
who will be affected by the shocks and 
stresses in the city. The initiatives included 
in the document are expected to inspire 
these actors in realizing actions to face 
the urban challenges and taking part in 
building city resilience.

Therefore, the document is expected to 
be able to support collaboration between 
various stakeholders in Semarang, 
Indonesia and the international world.

The city resilience strategy development was 
coordinated by the CRO (Chief Resilience Officer) 
team. The team was supported by six working 
groups related to the analysis process of each 
priority aspect. In the process, the team found a 
number of inputs from various city stakeholders 
during a series of meetings and workshops.

During the development, the team had received 
guidance from the Resilience Steering Committee. 
The committee included the City Secretary, 
acting as the committee advisor; and the head of 
Semarang’s BAPPEDA (Regional Development 
Planning Board), acting as the committee 
chairperson. The team was also supported by 
other urban decision makers, representatives of 
the business sector, academics, and community 
representatives. In terms of developing the 
substance, the team also consulted with the 
already established Urban Development Advisory 
Council whose members were made up of experts 
representing various fields in Semarang. 

The strategy formulation was also supported by 
Mercy Corps Indonesia as the strategy partner.

TOPOGRAPHY OF SEMARANG

Semarang has a varied topography. 
Although known more as a coastal city, 
hilly areas can also be found in Semarang. 
The lowland in the north region along 
the coast is known as Semarang bawah 
(lower). The old city’s center and also 
the center of government and trade are 
located in this area.

Meanwhile, the hilly south region is 
known as Semarang atas (upper). Waduk 
Jatibarang (reservoir) is located here. The 
city development is increasingly moving 
to the upper region. This trend threatens 
the upstream area that functions as a 
conservation area.

COASTLINE SHIFTING

In the 6th century, the coastline of 
Semarang was in Bergota area, not too far 
from Simpang Lima area (the current city 
center).

The sedimentation is coming from upper 
Semarang to the coastal area, shifting the 
coastline further to the Java Sea. Until 2007, 
the coastline has extended as far as ±6,5km. 

The current climate change affects coastal 
abrasion and reduces ground height on the 
new dry land as a result from sedimentation. 
Coastal abrasion causes the coastline to 
shift inland as far as 2.6 km (Wicaksono in 
Climate Week, 2015).

Semarang is a multicultural city with various 
ethnicities inhabiting the city. The diverse 
culture has been evident for a long time, 
and the community lives harmoniously with 
each other. This is one of the strengths of 
Semarang community; social provocations 
do not really work and social conflicts are 
rare.

URBAN DEVELOPMENT

Semarang city began to develop in the 
coastal area. The Dutch also built here 
before Indonesia independence and now 
it is become the Old City area. However, 
lately the trend shifted physically and 
culturally. There have been urban sprawl 
in the city and the community now 
inhabits the suburban area, far from the 
coast.

People live in various kampung 
neighbourhoods. Kampung is high 
density urban settlement neighbourhood 
where residents build their own houses. 
Each kampung has strong identity and 
traditions such as communal work (gotong 
royong). While large part of Semarang is 
still kampung, the new development in 
suburban area shifts toward formal landed 
housing by developers.

SEMARANG RESILIENCE
CHALLENGE 

Semarang has a long history—
approaching its 469th anniversary in 
2016— and it continues to transform. 
The city of 1.5 million inhabitants is 
facing an economic transition from an 
industrially based economy to services 
and trade. Semarang’s industrial area has 
moved to the outskirts of the city, thus 
creating changes. The labor force must 
respond to these changes with better 
preparation. Built up areas of Semarang 
and the surrounding areas grow rapidly 
in a sprawling pattern, which is not 
supported by the provision of adequate 
transport services and infrastructure.

Semarang deals with various physical 
challenges due to its geography as 
a coastal city, such as tidal flooding, 
erosion, land subsidence and rising sea 
levels, which threatens the lowlands of 
Semarang. Simultaneously, development 
in the hilly upper Semarang has led 
to a decrease of tree coverage in 

the upstream area, which severely 
increases vulnerability to landslides, 
water shortages and floods. Regarding 
health issues, as a tropical city Semarang 
is prone to outbreaks of dengue 
hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

These shocks and stresses present more 
continuous challenges for Semarang. 
These interrelated challenges, if left 
unaddressed, can lead to more problems 
and increase the severity of further 
shocks. Shocks and stresses can upset 
both the environment and the continuity 
of business service—and when the 
business sector is disrupted, residents 
lose their livelihood. The marginal and 
poor communities are most people 
that are most greatly affected by these 
issues.

in Semarang:

Limited provision of access

Higher unemployment

Related to the resilient status of 
Semarang and to complement the 
shock and stress assessment, 100RC 
also helped us to identify public 
perception of the city’s performance 
of resilience. The assessment was 
conducted by holding workshops with 
participants from the government, 
the business sector, local universities, 
and communities. These participants 
were asked to mention and measure 
resilience-related factors in Semarang.

The results of the assessment showed 
that people were more concerned with 
certain dimensions of resilience, such as 
infrastructure and basic needs. This result 
was consistent with the assessment on 
shocks and stresses in Semarang.  Factors 
related to infrastructure and basic needs 
were more frequently mentioned and 
considered most important. However, the 
performance of the city on both factors was 
considered weak, as seen in the following 
image. In the image, it can be seen that, for 
example, sanitation assets were reviewed as 
poor and must be upgraded.

Challenges to the capacity of Semarang

Siloed planning and

Poor public message, information

Low education level

Physical shocks and stresses are perceived 
as the main challenge in the city because 
they are easy to identify and people 
can directly relate to them. Yet, while 
intervention was conducted to tackle 
said shocks and stresses, the result of this 
intervention was not optimal, indicating that 
there were other weaknesses that were not 
being addressed. 

There seemed to be less public attention 
to leadership, strategy, and socioeconomic 
dimensions, which was confirmed by the 
resilience assessment. Furthermore, a 
more thorough analysis found problems 

46

RESILIENT SEMARANGrelated to siloed planning and management 
between the municipal agencies and 
provincial government, a lack of information 
dissemination to the public and low 
education levels, which are reflected in the 
limited capacity of the city. 

This shows that the shocks and stresses, 
as well as the perception assessment, 
can easily recognize that there is much 
attention paid to the perceived problems of 
infrastructure, basic needs and congestion, 
while there is less attention paid to the 
issue of capacity. However, we believe that 
capacity serves an important function in 
improving our resilience. Any efforts on 
improving our resilience in  facing increasing 
shocks and stresses needs to be supported 
with excellent capacity. Therefore, this city 
resilience strategy will put a lot of attention 
on building capacity, specifically on building 
capacity for the government, communities 
and institutions to increase empowerment 
and productivity. This holistic view of seeing 
the relationship of perceived problems and 
function is reflected in the following graph.

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG SECURITY

RELATED SHOCKS AND STRESSES

Tidal floods, DHF outbreaks, landslides, and—more recently— flash floods affect the city 
of Semarang, due to its coastal position. The city also has a large task in providing for the 
basic needs, such as water and electricity, of its citizens. Physical shocks combined with 
stresses— such as a high level of unemployment— can increase the impact of the shocks 
and reduce the community’s ability to survive, especially within poor and vulnerable 
communities.

A resilient city is a place that can provide protection for the inhabitants. As the first 
step, city inhabitants must be able to survive and adapt to various shocks and stresses. 
Security is the basis of strengthening resilience in Semarang against the shocks and 
stresses that have a direct impact on the community; security also covers the issues 
that were identified by city stakeholders. A successful urban system is a system that can 
provide protection and security to the community. 

CLEAN WATER

The main water sources in Semarang 
are (1) water springs, which contribute 
up to 11%, (2) underground water, which 
supplies up to 19% and (3) surface water, 
which is estimated to provide a whopping 
70% of the residents’ water. However, 
the quality of these sources is threatened 
by both domestic and non-domestic 
waste into the river. Another problem is 

saltwater intrusion in the northern part of 
the city. The concentrate of chloride (Cl) 
has been increasing steadily for the past 
20 years. Chloride content in clean water 
must not exceed 250 mg/L; levels higher 
than that indicate poor water quality. The 
underground water in the coastal area of 
Semarang exceeds the maximum level of 
chloride found in clean water.

48

RESILIENT SEMARANGMeanwhile, the need for clean water tends 
to increase along with rising population. It 
is estimated that the need for clean water 
will continue to increase up to 200% in the 
next 15 years. The city’s water demand is 
supplied by water sources that are managed 
by the state-owned water company (PDAM) 
as well as non-PDAM parties. The Semarang 
PDAM manages their water source in a 
network of pipelines. Some sources of 
surface water are still in their development 
process and have not yet been utilized, 
including Waduk (reservoir) Jatibarang 
with the capacity of 1,000L/s, Blorong River 
with the capacity of 200L/s and Pramuka 
water processing installation (IPA) with the 
capacity of 200L/s.

Meanwhile, non-PDAM parties distribute 
water via a pipeline system and a non-
pipeline system. Non-pipeline distribution 
by non-PDAM parties contributes 31% of the 
total clean water in the city, which comes 
from dug wells and pumped wells. The 
proportion of this contribution is still very 
high. 

The 100:0:100 program listed in the 2015-
2019 RPJMN targeted 100% clean water 
service in the city. In order to reach the 
target, the quality level of clean water 
service via a pipeline system by both 
PDAM and non-PDAM in Semarang must 

be increased. One of the challenges 
in providing clean water to citizens of 
Semarang is the diversity of topographic 
conditions in the city. For example, 
Kelurahan Gunung Pati has a steep slope 
level of 20-40%, which means that the 
PDAM cannot provide any water service 
at this location. Besides that, population 
increase subsequently causes the 
demand of clean water to increase as 
well. Twenty percent of the total citizens 
that have not been covered by the 
PDAM will be encouraged to get water 
from non-underground water sources.

51

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG ENERGY

Matching water demand, as the number 
of citizens in Semarang increases, so 
too does the  energy consumption 
level, concentrated in electricity and 
transportation. The supply of electricity 
is still balanced against the demand 
from various sectors. Demand for energy 
is supplied by the steam power plant 
(PLTU) Tambak Lorok in the North 
Semarang sub-district; there is a plan 
for a water power plant in Jatibarang. 
Supply of electricity in Semarang is 
managed under the authority of the 
central government. The electrical 
system in Semarang is connected to the 
Java-Bali national electricity system, 
supplied by several main power sources 
such as Paiton and Jepara. The 9 main 
power relay stations in Semarang meet 
the 2,000 MW demand, but despite that, 
power outage happens often. In 2013, 

there were 1,144 reports of power outage to 
the state-owned electricity company/PLN 
(BPS 2014).  

Ironically, non-renewable energy 
resources such as oil, gas and coal are still 
predominantly used to fulfill energy needs 
in Semarang, despite the fact that these 
sources will be exhausted sooner with their 
continuous consumption. Furthermore, both 
fuel and electricity consumption increase 
emission levels.

Energy consumption in Semarang 
contributes to the city’s greenhouse gas 
emissions. It is predicted that greenhouse 
gas emissions from the energy sector 
can increase up to 74.7% in 2020 with 
the current energy consumption pattern. 
Energy efficiency and the development of 
renewable energy sources are needed to 
ensure the continuation of energy service 
for the citizens of Semarang.

RESILIENT SEMARANGThe number of small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) is growing, on average, 
2.83% annually (Semarang municipal 
secretary) with a total of 11,585 SMEs in 
2014. SME is a potential sector to reduce 
the income gap. Popular SMEs in Semarang 
are, among others, smoked milkfish 
business, hand-made batik and traditional 
food processing. SMEs are a part of the 
formal sector but they are offset by the 
informal sector spread in the city. SMEs 
and informal sector do not only provide 
goods and services to consumers with low 
purchasing power, but they also cater to the 
needs of consumers with higher purchasing 
power. Small enterprises also provide raw 
materials or services to medium and large 
enterprises, including the local government. 
The social purpose of these businesses is to 
achieve the minimum level of welfare, which 
guarantees the provision of basic needs to 
all members of the community. 

ECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT

The challenge that must be faced by 
the city in terms of employment is 
the imbalance and mismatch between 
the labor demand and the available 
employment. The percentage of 
unemployment in Semarang is 7.76%, 
higher than the average percentage in the 
province of Central Java (5.86%). Since 
Semarang is the province’s capital and 
one of the metropolitan centers in Java, 
workers and job seekers also come from 
outside of the city.

The industrial sector holds the highest 
levels of employment in Semarang, yet its 
contribution to the city’s economy is the 
second highest after trade, and the hotel 
and restaurant sector. However, based 
on the RPJMD, Semarang is encouraged 
to transition to a trade and service city. 
Therefore, the economy is shifting towards 
the trade and hospitality sectors, and 
then to a processing and communication 
sector. Meanwhile, the industrial sector 
would continue to develop in the suburban 
outskirts of the city. This goal must be 
supported by preparing the adequate 
labor force.

53

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG In the context of fairness and equality, 
men currently dominate labor in 
Semarang, with a ratio of 60:40,  
although the gender proportion of job 
seekers is 50:50. Equality between male 
and female laborers and also disabled 
people must be taken into consideration; 
everyone is entitled to equal rights to 
gain income.

Other than that, health and social 
security for the people must be 
extended, not only to the formal 
sector but also to the informal sector. 
The formal sector’s participation in 
insurance schemes is good enough, 
however, workers in the informal 
sector— including traders, fishermen or 
freelance laborers—do not adequately 
participate. This low participation in the 

informal sector is due to the community’s 
lack of awareness surrounding insurance, 
though there is potential for development 
in the informal sector as well as in micro 
enterprises and small and medium 
enterprises.

Another sector that holds an important 
role is the market, both modern and 
traditional. Modern and traditional markets 
affect the regional income. The income 
tax from businesspeople and traders can 
increase the original regional income 
(PAD). It is then necessary to maintain 
the presence of the market. Other than 
functioning economically, traditional 
markets specifically have historical values 
that should be maintained, such as in 
Pasar Johar. 

DISASTERS 

Semarang is known for different 
types of disaster especially with its 
frequent flooding. There are two types 
of floods that occur in Semarang, i.e. 
tidal flooding caused by, among other 
things, the increase of seawater level 
and land subsidence (causing seawater 
to flood the coastal area), and flash 
flooding (a sudden flood due to high 
precipitation that increases the river’s 

water discharge). There are 21 rivers 
located in Semarang, creating a high risk 
of flash flood. Other contributing factors 
to flash floods include poor drainage 
infrastructure, environmental degradation 
in the upstream area, sedimentation in the 
downstream area and high precipitation.

54

RESILIENT SEMARANGCommunal waste management can also 
contribute to the likelihood of a flood 
disaster. Flash floods and tidal floods 
are related to the community’s neglect 
towards the environment, such as in the 
case of littering. Furthermore, the municipal 
government’s waste management service 
only managed to pick up 34% of the total 
waste in 2013, and left behind the remaining 
66%. This illustrates the poor management 
of the city’s waste, considering 50% of the 
total population was not covered by the 
service— especially in the slum kampung 
where the low income and vulnerable 
people live.

Flood disaster is a regional issue, since 
it is not isolated to one particular area. 
It needs thorough management and 
requires cooperation between different 
administrative regions. For example, the 
upstream area of the Kali Garang watershed 
is located in the Semarang district. The 
development trend towards areas in upper 
Semarang, which initially was established 
as a conservation area, creates a more 
complex situation.

Meanwhile, tidal flooding, beginning in 
1957, is increasingly worse due to land 
subsidence and climate change causing 
seawater rise. Vital assets such as the 
airport, the rail station and the port are 
located in areas that are prone to tidal 
flooding. The rate of land subsidence,

floods, has increased to >10-13 cm/year. 
Underground water extraction, a key 
source of water in the city, also increases 
the likelihood of land subsidence. This 
creates more problems in water provision 
because the current pipeline network is 
still limited. 

Sea levels are estimated to increase 
by around 15.5 cm by 2030 and 77.5 
cm in 2110. However, land subsidence 
poses a greater, more urgent threat to 
the community. It reached a growth 
rate of 13 cm annually in 2015, meaning 
that tidal floods would affect around 
300,000 people inhabiting the coastal 
area of Semarang, including North 
Semarang, East Semarang sub-district 
and Gayamsari sub-district.

Unfortunately, the residents in said 
coastal communities mainly work as 
factory workers and fishermen, and do 
not have the resources to mitigate these 
issues. Some of them adapted their 
houses to be higher than the ground 
surface, while some simply see the flood 
as a part of normal life considering it 
happens so often. Furthermore, their 
kampung is largely comprised of slums 
and exist in poor conditions.

Beyond this, landslide incidents also 
occur in Semarang, especially in the 
higher altitude areas of South and East 
Semarang. Landslides are influenced by 
the fluctuation of precipitation, type of 
soil, and decreased vegetation due to 
higher development in risk prone areas. 
This offers a challenge with the current 
development trend towards the hilly 
upper Semarang.

“…we can’t just be reactive, 
but (we need) to be proactive, 
solving problems starting from 
the upstream (area),”  

The government of Indonesia (GoI) 
encourages efforts to reduce the risk of 
disasters by establishing disaster-resilient 
kelurahan (rural villages). On that 
note, Semarang established a Disaster-
preparedness Group (KSB) to reduce 
the impacts of disasters on a kelurahan 
level. By the end of 2014, Semarang 
established 22 KSBs in locations that 
were prone to floods, landslides and fires. 
Every kelurahan that is prone to disasters 
must be continuously encouraged to 
establish KSBs. Furthermore, training 
and knowledge sharing on the risk of 
disasters must be spread and applied in 
the community.

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG DISEASE OUTBREAKS

Tropical climate and the steady increase 
of temperature due to climate change 
have aided the flourishing of different 
types of viruses in Semarang. High levels 
of humidity also encourage mosquitoes 
to breed, which is one reason why 
Semarang has a high number of dengue 
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases, the 
3rd highest number of DHF cases in 
Indonesia in 2015.

DHF is caused by dengue virus, which 
is transmitted by mosquitoes, Aedes 
aegypti. Aedes aegypti can breed in 
abandoned houses, empty land, midden, 
poultry enclosure, horticultural garden, 
mosques, stagnate gutters, water parks, 

water container behind water dispenser and 
refrigerator units that often are overlooked by 
people.

Human population density is another factor 
of DHF occurrence, where dense areas 
would tend to have more DHF case. People 
younger than 14 years old are more prone to 
contract DHF. Special care and interventions 
are needed to reduce the risk of DHF in 
this vulnerable age group, for example by 
conducting interventions at their locations 
and during their activities. DHF prevention 
efforts at school should become one of the 
main concerns, considering school-aged 
children spend much of their time at school, 
especially in the morning (Semarang HCVA, 2015).

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG MOBILITY

RELATED SHOCKS AND STRESSES

If Semarang fails to provide good access and connectivity, the fundamental element 
of security cannot be achieved. A city with good mobility can support its citizens 
to conduct various activities easily and affordably. Good mobility also prevents 
geographical isolation that weakens the social relationships between communities 
and other groups.

Challenges related to mobility have been put under the spotlight considering the 
increasing risk of congestion in numerous parts of Semarang. Public transportation is 
still not optimal in both its quantity and quality. The condition is complicated further 
by the sprawling regional development, preventing infrastructures to be provided 
efficiently.

60

RESILIENT SEMARANGPUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

Semarang is the provincial capital, 
located strategically, supported by train 
line, seaport and airport; goods and 
human transport here is very active. 
The annual increase of population in 
Semarang also increases the demand 
of mobility. However, the quality and 
quantity of public transportation in the 
city is inadequate, causing people to 
choose their private vehicles over public 
transport.

The growth of private vehicle ownership 
in the past five years has shown a 
significant increase, especially for 

motorbikes. From 2013 to 2014, private 
vehicle ownership increased as much 
as 16%, while road only grew 0.09%. 
The management of public transport 
in Semarang is not yet integrated and 
effective, despite establishing the Bus 
Rapid Transit (BRT) system.

The quantity of the BRT unit is insufficient, 
causing a longer waiting period at every 
bus stop, especially at bus channels with a 
high number of passengers. The separated 
public transport system also raises the 
cost of transportation, particularly when 
passengers have to change to different 
buses—they have to pay for each bus 
separately. The buses themselves, as well 

61

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG as the bus stops, are in poor condition 
with a host of damages. Bus stops were 
designed to have a higher platform than 
the pavement; however, this separates 
BRT from other modes of public 
transportation.

Private vehicles, especially motorbikes, 
can be purchased quite easily and 
cheaply, which attracts more people 

to get their own. This, in return, increases 
congestion significantly. One major 
concern is the low supervision of the use 
of private vehicles on the road. Underage 
students are often found driving, having 
obtained their driving license illegally. These 
students never took the driving exam that 
should have been obligatory to ensure the 
adequate mastery of driving. This increases 
the number of road accidents.

RESILIENT SEMARANGURBAN SPRAWL AND COMMUTE

Another challenge regarding public 
transportation is its limited coverage; 
it is not able to cover every area in 
Semarang. Transportation in Semarang 
can be categorized into two types: formal 
and informal. Formal transportation 
modes include minibus (angkot), bus 
and BRT, while informal transportation 
modes include motor taxi (ojek) and 
rickshaw. There are more than 2,000 
public minibuses and 90 formal routes in 
Semarang, but despite this some areas 
are still not covered. Many of these areas 
are settlement or trip generation areas, 
so the inhabitants choose to use informal 
transportation modes that actually do 
not adhere to government-implemented 
conditions of public transportation.
The spreading of the city in urban sprawl 
with people moving to work and study 

present a challenge in providing transport 
infrastructure. The cost of infrastructure 
and service for transportation will 
increase and coordination with the 
surrounding areas will be needed to 
manage this challenge.

Private vehicles are a more attractive 
option than public transport. However, 
this creates several issues. On one hand, 
private vehicles enable the community 
to conveniently reach their destination, 
but on the other hand, they increase 
congestion. The highest mobility can be 
found on main roads, despite the capacity 
of these roads remaining low, which 
results in congestion. Transportation is 
also a high emission source—with high 
frequency of congestion, the produced 
emission will increase.

Santi, 
59 years old 

citizen of 
Kelurahan Rowosari

 “…where I live there isn’t any public 
transport, so we rely on our motorbike. 
If we didn’t have the motorbike it 
would be hard to go to places. The 
kids take the minibus operated by 
someone in the neighborhood…”

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG CAPACITY

RELATED SHOCKS AND STRESSES

Capacity is the keyword in understanding city resilience in the context of 100RC and the 
basis of strengthening said resilience. However, capacity is not yet considered crucial in 
Semarang. The system does not have enough capacity when a city has a great potential 
in the economy, location and funding, but is unable to improve quality of life. 

Despite its great potential, Semarang cannot progress to the next level because it is 
not able to mobilize resources from various levels. Not only does the government lack 
this ability, but so too do other stakeholders, including academics, communities, the 
business sector and greater society. Furthermore, the current governance system and 
leadership cannot support the participation of stakeholders in contributing to the city’s 
development.   

Achieving good governance and a responsible government requires implementation of 
the principles of accountability, transparency and legal supremacy by involving members 
of community in the drafting process of every public policy. The community must be 
accommodated throughout this process. This effort, although still not optimal, had been 
implemented in the development planning of Semarang. 

COORDINATION FOR 
DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION 

In carrying out the planned programs, 
the availability of resources and the 
ability to allocate those resources are 
the foundation for achieving optimal 
development. The ability to allocate 
available resources is based in the 
ability to lead, shown in the way the city 
government utilizes the knowledge or 

deep understanding of various potentials 
and problems in order to find various 
alternative solutions. 

There are four issues in building the 
capacity of resources: institution, 
knowledge, leadership and accountability. 
Based on the workshop and capacity 

64

RESILIENT SEMARANGabsorption, with some only reaching 
50%. This could indicate that the city’s 
preparedness in managing shocks and 
stresses might be reduced. As the value 
of SILPA increases annually, it shows that 
the funds from PAD and other regional 
income sources have not been absorbed 
optimally. Furthermore, another problem 
is the absence of a follow-up of the SKPD 
program post-evaluation. 

One of the key components in achieving 
an inclusive Semarang is the availability 
of a mechanism to ensure community’s 
participation. Musrenbang, a regional 
development-planning forum represents 
this type of participatory development 
planning. The municipal government 
holds Musrenbang annually. This forum is 
conducted in phases on a neighborhood, 
kelurahan, sub-district and municipal 
level in order to collect people’s 
opinions related to city development. 
Unfortunately, the implementation design 
of Musrenbang is heavily influenced 
by a top-down approach, signified by 
the unified planning approaches in the 
national and regional level. The forum 
is often too rigid and formal, especially 
concerning the schedule. It is too short to 
enable a more intensive participation and 
communication between the government 
and community. 

assessment of Semarang held by the 
100RC team, the city’s ability was 
considered still inadequate and required 
more improvement, especially in the 
aspects of strategic environment, regional 
finance, human resources, knowledge 
development and inclusivity.  

Strategic environmental analysis must 
be considered in drafting policies and 
budgets. This has been applied in the 
city’s planning and policy documents, 
however this is not supported by an 
analysis related to the capacity of 
Semarang in facing and creating a 
strategic environment in managing 
various changes. This indicated that a 
dialogue mechanism to discuss strategic 
environment had not yet been seen as a 
priority.

Semarang’s financial management is 
based on the regional budget (APBD). 
APBD management is targeted to create 
an illustration of the regional financial 
capacity and ability to fund regional 
development. In general, sources of 
funding in regional finance are derived 
from 2 sources: regional income (tax, 
levy and grant), and other funds from the 
cooperation between the government 
and other parties (joint venture and 
concession).

The issue in this context is the high 
amount of undisbursed funds (SILPA) in 
Semarang. In 2014, SILPA reached 33%, 
far above the allowed percentage (6%). 
Infrastructure programs have low budget 

65

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG PUBLIC INFORMATION

Semarang, a metropolis in the Central 
Java Province, has a faster information 
cycle compared to the surrounding 
cities or districts. Therefore, periodic 
informational updates and collection of 
the newest information are necessary to 
improve future policies and regulations 
in Semarang. It is necessary to highlight 
the importance of transparency in 
information. Accountability of the 
government can be increased through 
the mechanism and implementation of 
principles of transparency.     

“Semarang government must improve their 
communication with the community because people 
would also like to be involved in the development of 
Semarang”

 (@richamiskiyya, a participant of the 100RC Twitter 
competition, 2015).

Public information is valued in two ways, 
from the government and community. 
The information from the government is 
expected to be complete, transparent, 
and integrated between the SKPDs, 
while information from the community is 
expected to include reports and permits 
that people require so they can be 
followed up fast and properly.

The city facilitates information sharing 
via electronic media that can be accessed 
easily by the community. However, the 
problem is that not all communities can 
access electronic media, which means that 
information dispersion via print media or 
government socialization is still needed.
The community expects a clearer system 
for permit processing as well as its easy 
application. The permit application process 
currently takes a long time. However, ease 
is not the only factor observed. Adequate 
and transparent information will enable 
people to apply for permits correctly and 
thus help create a better city development.

People’s complaints must be collected 
and followed up in a two-way process 
between the government and community. 
It is expected that this will improve public 
service performance. Too many separate 
outlets for complaint have caused some 
complaints to go unnoticed. Another 
problem is that a facility for people to file 
a complaint has still not been properly 
introduced.

66

RESILIENT SEMARANGHUMAN RESOURCES

The level of educational qualification 
is not balanced in Semarang. The gap 
between primary school and junior high 
school graduates is quite significant. It 
shows that the education level of some 
citizens of Semarang is still relatively low. 
With a low education level, they would 
face problems in gaining employment. 
Therefore, to improve their welfare, they 
must improve their education level. Most 
of the available employment requires 
workers with a minimum high school 
degree. This situation contributes to the 
low productivity of Semarang’s citizens.

Meanwhile, around 27% of the total 
workers of the Semarang government 
office only has a high-school degree, 
while 48% has a bachelor’s degree, 5% has 
a master’s degree and only 1 person has 
a doctorate. This is evidently a challenge 
that must be dealt by building educational 
capacity to improve the organizational 
ability and regulatory system in 
mobilizing resources to improve the city’s 
development in the future.

CHALLENGES TO RESILIENT SEMARANG RESILIENT CITY 
STRATEGY

Semarang city resilience strategy is built on capacity 
building of the city’s institutions, people and communities 
while addressing the main challenges in providing security 
and mobility. Therefore, the city resilience strategy covers 
the perceived challenges and functionality and capacity of 
the city in facing shocks and stresses. 

Each initiative mainly tackles direct 
challenges, but it is strongly based 
on capacity building of the affected 
stakeholders in order to build and 
maintain their resilience better. People 
and communities respond, adapt and 
learn when they face shocks and stresses 

that are beyond technical solutions 
and infrastructure. A holistic view on 
Semarang resilience challenges includes 
18 strategies and 53 initiatives that fall 
under the six pillar strategy. 

The six pillars are, as follows:

70

RESILIENT SEMARANG1. SUSTAINABLE WATER 
AND ENERGY

2. NEW ECONOMIC 
OPPORTUNITIES

Semarang will meet and 
use water and energy in 
a sustainable manner  to 
address challenges such as 
the risk of water scarcity, 
decreasing quality of water 
and undistributed electricity.

Semarang will create an 
economic climate that 
allows the emergence of 
new opportunities in order 
to decrease the number of 
unemployment and prepare 
for a new economic status as 
a center of trade and services 

3. PREPAREDNESS FOR 
DISASTERS AND DISEASE 
OUTBREAKS

Semarang will improve 
information sharing, innovation 
and collaboration for 
improving the preparedness 
for disasters and disease 
outbreaks 

4. INTEGRATED MOBILITY

Semarang will improve the 
connectivity and institutional 
capacity of transportation 
service to address mobility 
challenges such as traffic 
congestion, poor quality of 
public transportation and poor 
accessibility

5. TRANSPARENT PUBLIC 
INFORMATION AND 
GOVERNANCE

Semarang will increase 
information transparency and 
governance to improve the 
quality of the program and its 
performance considering the 
performance of development 
budget is still low, resulting in 
inefficient public services

6. COMPETITIVE HUMAN 
RESOURCES

Semarang will provide access 
to new skills and knowledge 
for the citizens, preparing the 
ASEAN Economic Community 
launch and also capacity 
building of Semarang labor 
force, considering their current 
low qualification.

RESILIENT CITY STRATEGYTHE INTERRELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN STRATEGIES 
AND PILLARS 

Our pillars and strategies are interrelated 
to ensure that the strategies and 
initiatives provide integrated solutions. 
“Transparent Public Information and 
Governance” and “Competitive Human 
Resources” are strongly correlated to 
other pillar strategies, showing our focus 
on building capacity towards better city 
resilience.

One pillar has elements that are related 
to other strategies under a different 
pillar. For example, our strategy on 
developing environmental and social-
friendly businesses under “New Economic 

Opportunities” is closely related to our 
innovation effort in water provision under 
“Sustainable Water and Energy” and 
preparing workforce for the job market 
under “Competitive Human Resources”. 
This interrelationship also presents in other 
pillars.

This image below shows the 
interrelationship between the strategies and 
pillars, describing the integrated and holistic 
view in building resilience. The straight, bold

Until now, the pipeline service of clean water 
from both the PDAM/State-Water Company 
and non-PDAM sources (community water, 
private, etc.) have not been able to cover 
all regions in Semarang. In 2015, the PDAM 
managed to cover 59% of the total area and 
non-PDAM covered 9.4%, whilst the rest of 
the population met their need through non-
pipeline network. Considering this condition, 
this strategy is trying to build, develop and 
optimize the management of clean water so 
that the pipeline service coverage of clean 
water from both PDAM and non-PDAM will 
reach 100%, aligned with the national target.

Sixty nine percent of the 
total amount of clean water 
in Semarang comes from the 
rivers. However, the quality of 
these rivers is decreasing due to 
pollution. Therefore, the initiative 
must be conducted immediately 
in order to maintain the quality of

for river polluters and 
developing communal 
waste treatment that is 
aligned with the Regional 
Regulation No. 6/2012 
on waste management 
and the Regional 
Regulation No. 13/2006 
on environment control. 
Monitoring system must 
also be improved. The 
watershed area (DAS) 
from upstream to 
downstream potentially 
can become a major 
source of clean water. 
Coordination with 
neighbouring areas is also 
necessary.

The various environmental 
challenges which Semarang 
must manage require 
comprehensive solutions. The 
upstream area provides water 
and requires special attention. 
Problems on the upstream 
area could affect downstream, 
where the city is functioning and 
activities mainly happen. 

Therefore, solutions to 
environmental problems should 
consider the problem source 
and does not only focus on the 
affected areas. The initiative 
also aims to ensure the quality 
of clean water sources. Some 
conservation efforts have been 
done in Semarang such as 
greening the river bank of West 
Flood Canal. 

Action: 
Upstream area 
reforestation, involving 
local community and 
choosing species 
with economic value, 
promoting biopore 
method, controlling water 
loss in the supply system 

Resilience value: 
Upstream area 
conservation can improve 
the rehabilitation of 
ground water. Besides 
environment quality 
improvement and the 
fulfillment of basic needs, 
the innovation will be able 
to improve community’s 
welfare by planting

1st PILLAR STRATEGY  | SUSTAINABLE WATER AND ENERGYB1 | Extend the Utilization of Rain 
Water 

Key 
Initiative

Advancing

Rain Water Harvesting/
RWH is collecting and storing 
rain water for later use. The 
initiative has been introduced in 
Semarang by some institutions 
for various purposes. Semarang 
Environmental Office initiated 
the installation of RWH at 
public and educational facilities, 
located at Kelurahan Tandang 
and Kelurahan Wonosari. The 
Semarang Water, Energy and 
Mineral Resources Office used 
this method to reduce the 
amount of runoff and manage 
floods. The Semarang Agricultural 
Office applied the method to 
irrigate agricultural land. The 
RWH has the potential to become 
an alternative water source in 
the city, especially water scarce 
areas. 

Action: Promoting the 
concept of RWH and 
providing support for 
the initial construction 
which may include 
offering incentive and 
guidance for households 
that will be installing 
the RWH. The services 
will be extended,

especially to meet 
household needs, in line 
with the target of the 
national and municipal 
government’s programs 
to provide clean water 
to every member of the 
community.

Resilience value: This 
initiative does not only 
support the provision 
of basic water need 
but also minimize the 
impacts of disasters. The 
main benefit of RWH is 
to provide alternative 
water source. It can 
also reduce the use 
of groundwater that 
contributes to land 
subsidence in Semarang 
and reduce runoff.

Location target: Public 
facilities, educational 
facilities, household, 
offices and commercials 
buildings 

RESILIENT SEMARANGB2 | Optimize Surface Water 
Utilization

Key 
Initiative

Ongoing

Excessive groundwater utilization 
can cause land subsidence and 
seawater intrusion, which can be 
seen from the high concentration 
of chloride in some areas in 
Semarang. The utilization of 
surface water from reservoirs 
can replace ground water. This 
method is expected to cover 
the majority of domestic and 
non-domestic needs. Currently, 
Semarang utilizes several 
sources of surface water, such as 
Jatibarang Dam.

Action: Building new 
water storage such as 
ponds/retention basin to 
help retain the surface 
water. This initiative is in 
line with the visions and 
missions of the current 
mayor of Semarang to 
build new ponds as a 
source of clean water.

Resilience Value: This 
initiative also aims to 
decrease runoff, land 
subsidence and sea 
water intrusion. So, it will 
become an alternative 
way to ensure the 
provision of basic needs 
for Semarang citizens 
and minimize the disaster 
impacts.

Technology 

Advancing

Grey water can be an alternative 
water source, especially for 
plantations. Grey water recycle 
technology requires simple 
methods and low budget. Simple 
filtering process can process 
grey water for non-human 
consumption use. Additionally, 
by reusing treated wastewater, 
environmental pollution and 
water use can be reduced.

Action: Treating and 
reusing grey water for 
non-human consumption 
purposes, such as 
irrigation; advocacy (by 
the government) on the 
standards and conditions 
of grey water recycle 
technology development; 
preparing installation

domestic and non-domestic need 
of clean water. This initiative is 
in line with program planned in 
Long Term Plan of Semarang 
2005-2025 and clean water 
system master plan of Semarang. 
However, there are no cities in 
Indonesia that has developed

PROMOTING 
ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY BEHAVIORS 

Daily life is very much connected to energy 
and the utilization of electricity and fossil fuel. 
Considering that fossil fuel is not renewable, 
initiatives must be planned to prevent excessive 
consumption of fossil fuel. While the provision 
of fuel and electricity is under the national 
government’s authority, energy issues must be 
addressed at municipal level. The city should 
encourage energy-saving behaviors and the 
development of alternative energy to preserve 
the environment.

Other than identifying alternative water 
resources (explained in the previous section), 
it is also important to consume water wisely. 
Water conservation needs to be encouraged, 
minimizing water exploitation..

There are a lot of ways to conserve energy, 
such as turning lights off when not in use, using 
shower (instead of a bath) and minimizing the 
use of private vehicles. Such simple actions, 
when conducted collectively, can save water and 
energy.

Key
Initiative

Ongoing

The WWF named Semarang 
energy-efficient city in 2014 for 
the efforts to reduce the effects 
of greenhouse gas emission and 
energy consumption. The high 
emission of greenhouse gases 
contributes to climate change. 
The citizens must adopt energy-
saving behavior, reducing GHG 
emission. Similarly, people must 
be able to conserve water.

Saving energy and water can 
be performed by individual, 
companies and government. 
Some youth communities 
initiated a power-saving 
movement, such as the “turn 
power off for 1 hour” campaign. In 
addition to that, the government 
and business communities need 
to start the implementation of 
green building. Green building 
is an environmentally friendly 
structure with an efficient use of 
energy, water, and materials.

Solid waste has the potential to 
become an alternative energy 
source. There are two concepts 
in this idea: converting landfill 
waste into energy and organic 
waste utilization in biogas and 
bio digester production. The 
landfill waste conversion concept 
was initiated by the Sanitation 
and Landscaping Office and 
the organic waste utilization 
concept was initiated by the 
Environmental Office. The biogas 
pilot project was located close to 
the Jatibarang landfill.

This initiative might reduce 
electricity and other fuels 
consumption. In addition, it 
can also reduce the amount of 
urban waste. This initiative has 
the potential to be replicated 
on a household and kampong 
neighborhood scale, such as for 
the kitchen’s energy source.

Action: Developing 
biogas and bio digester 
production; preparing 
procedures for 
installment; installing the 
biogas and bio digester in 
household

Resilience value: The 
initiative aims not only 
to reduce the amount 
of waste, but also help 
meeting basic energy 
needs. Furthermore, 
in the process, this

Semarang used to have a strong industrial presence; 
however its economy now shifts to trade and service 
sector. In relation to that, the city must be able to 
see new economic opportunities. Semarang has 
a lot of potentials for local business and creative 
economy, such as batik production, special local food 
(Semarang spring rolls/lumpia) and milkfish-based 
culinary.

In order to create an advantageous business climate, 
it needs to be supported by infrastructure that 
facilitates the flow of production distribution, skill 
trainings to build the communities’ capacity of local 
entrepreneurship and the expansion coverage of 
social security.

Also, modern and traditional markets have an 
important role in commodity distribution, including 
products of SME’s products. Modern markets are 
more likely to survive due to better investment 
and managerial structure, stronger than traditional 
markets. Therefore, the city resilience strategy 
focuses on the traditional market improvement 
where many traders mostly come from low income 
background.

as a city of trade and services. 
SME products include milkfish 
products, batik handicraft, 
and traditional food such as 
wingko and lumpia/spring rolls, 
traditional herbal medicines and 
other new innovative products.

Local products should be 
more promoted in anticipating 
the ASEAN Economic

Trade and service sector in 
Semarang grows rapidly. In 2013, 
it contributed 28.72% to the 
GDP, higher than other sectors. 
However, the products of trade 
and services from the local 
businesses are not widely known.

A3 | Promote E-Commerce and

Following the growing trade and 
service sector in Semarang, the 
business marketing approach 
is experiencing a transition as 
well. The advancement of digital 
and internet technology has 
also transformed the way of 
doing business. Internet-based 
infrastructure is used more 
and can be more effective as a 
campaigning tool. The emergence 
of e-commerce and e-business 
means the local businesses in 
Semarang must be able to adapt.

Social security and rights for 
employees, such as health

retirement, have been generally 
well provided in the government

The government health care 
and social security scheme, 
locally known as BPJS, has 
encouraged formal companies 
to provide social security for 
their employees. However, the 
coverage of this type of social 
security has not reached the SME 
and informal sector.
This is unfortunate since workers 
in SMEs and informal sector are 
more vulnerable to the dynamic 
economic market. Social security 
is the right of every worker, 
but it can become a burden for 
the employers, especially small 
business owners, while social 
security will provide safety for the 
workers and in result they can be 
more motivated and productive.

The attractiveness of street 
vendors as part of the informal 
sector is a pull factor of why 
labor force comes to Semarang 
and finds work in this sector. 
However, as they are largely 
informal, many street vendors are 
not registered and doing business 
in prohibited areas.

Through this initiative, the 
informal sector management can 
be improved without the need 
to eliminate street vendors. It is 
necessary to improve the welfare 
of informal workers by ensuring 
the stability of the sector.

In the next stage, the informal 
sector can be directed to move 
to the formal sector. Informal 
sector has enough potential to be 
encouraged and to sustain urban

Local market conditions can 
reflect the level of economic 
activities in Semarang. The 
Semarang Office of Market 
is revitalizing traditional 
markets. However the focus 
is placed mainly on physical 
improvements, for example in 
Bulu and Banyumanik market. 
Some of these traditional 
markets have historic buildings 
and careful planning should 
be made when they are going 
to be renovated, i.e. in Johar 
traditional market.

Ecologically, traditional markets 
contribute significant waste to 
the city. Waste management 
must be addressed, both at 

the temporary local landfill and 
during the distribution to the 
city landfill.

Besides the physical 
improvement, non-physical 
improvement is also critical. 
Traditional markets are 
encouraged to increase their 
coverage to regional and 
national scale but this has not 
been done optimally. 
Through this initiative, the role 
of traditional markets will be 
improved. Product quality must 
be maintained. High quality 
goods can be expected to meet 
consumer’s need in Semarang 
and its surrounding areas.

Advancing

In 2015, Semarang was third for 
the highest number for dengue 
incidents in Central Java. Climate 
change and high humidity level 
increase the population of 
Aedes aegypti mosquito that 
carries the virus. Cooperation 
between the Health Office, 
communities and NGOs resulted 
in the development of a program 
to control dengue outbreak, 
for example educate students 
in dengue fever dangerous 
at Kalipancur, Sukorejo and 
Sumurejo Sub-Districts. This 
initiative should be supported 
and improved. A dengue early 
warning system, preceded by 
modeling from the university, also 
exists in six sub-districts and has 
the potential to be improved for 
all districts in Semarang. Most 
importantly, city stakeholders 
must improve their coordination 
in order to work effectively and 
efficiently when facing dengue

Semarang is currently facing 
more risks from both natural 
and anthropogenic disasters. 
Moreover, Semarang is divided 
into upper and lower area and 
each area faces different types 
of disasters. Landslide and flash 
flood happen in upper Semarang, 
while lower Semarang which 
includes the coastal area must 
face tidal flood, coastal erosion 
and land subsidence. Fire, 
however, occurs in both areas. 
The development of information

health problems can be caused 
by poor sanitary condition. 
This is especially prominent in 
the slum kampungs with low 
income residents. Sanitation 
infrastructure could become 
more critical after a disaster 
occurred. Stakeholders should 
integrate and coordinate to solve 
this challenge. Improvement of 
participatory-based sanitation 
focuses on waste management, 
clean water provision and post-

initiatives related to water resilience. The 
country is a large laboratory that is trying 
to help citizens, particularly the new 
generation so that they understand the 
changing environment better and lead them 
to achieve water literacy. 

Since 2006, the Dutch government began 
the implementation of a project called 
“Room for the River”. The idea was to make 
more room for the river to overflow, rather 
than building right on its banks. Also that 
river would no longer flow along the city, 
but through it instead. This created a city 
that is fully integrated with the water. It 
took 10 years for them to create a new 
waterfront, giving up urban and farm land. 
This increased the development potential 
and reduced the risk of damage and loss of 
life in the future.

LEARNING FROM THE DUTCH

Sixty percent of the cities in the 100RC 
network identified flood as the major 
shock, while 20% identified water 
shortage as the stress. Too much and 
too little water have presented various 
challenges in urban life. In Rotterdam, 
nine cities with different water problems 
gathered to find solutions and explore 
holistic concepts in water management. 
By having multidisciplinary practitioners 
(urban designers, landscape architects, 
urban planners, academics and 
government officials), the discussion, 
named the Dutch dialogue, embraced an 
integrated approach to confront water 
management challenges in their cities; 
to live close to water and to recognize it 
as a central asset with a growing value. 
Whether the city is grappling with too 
much or trying to cope with too little 
water, there is a great opportunity to 
apply better integrated and cost-effective 
solutions that meet multiple current needs 
and are poised to address unknown future 
challenges.

The Netherlands has been coping with 
floods for centuries considering their 
country is partly below sea level. They 
empower the citizens to work together by 
supporting, inspiring and encouraging the 
application of water resilience concept 
on every stage of life from classroom 
education to professional training. This

BRT integration management 
has not yet been optimized. 
For example, BRT routes have 
covered transportation nodes, 
such as airport and station. 
However, the location of the bus 
shelters is quite far, which made 
it less appealing to people. The 
transit options between routes 
and with non-BRT transport 
are limited. The tariff is not

Meanwhile, principal elements of 
BRT such as special lane, shelters 
on median roads and intersection 
management that would 
have made the BRT working 
effectively have not been fully 
adopted in Semarang. Therefore, 

Semarang has not achieved

a transportation mode allocated 
for students, i.e. school bus. 
This initiative will likely have an 
indirect impact, reducing number 
of traffic accident involving 
students.

Apart from BRT, which 
is managed by the local 
government, other public 
transport vehicles are managed 
by individuals. The individual 
owners of public vehicles provide 
a subsidy for public transport 
users without any assistance 
from the government. However, 
the individual ownership of 
many public transport vehicles 
complicates monitoring of 
many things including safety. 
The establishment of a public 
transport consortium will help 
organizing, overseeing the 
operation of traditional public 
transport and coordinating the 
integration of BRT with traditional 
public transport, functioning as 
the feeder service.

Moreover, the consortium 
will allow the government to 
subsidize individual management

tourism destinations that attract 
both domestic and non-domestic 
tourists, including religious places 
and agro and cultural areas, such

C4 | Improve Accessibility to Newly 
Developed Areas 

The city is growing to the city 
outskirt, such as Tembalang and 
Pedurungan district due to the 
higher cost in the city center. 
Citizens prefer to live in these 
areas. New settlements grow 
with a sprawling pattern and not 
supported by good accessibility. 
This initiative aims to increase 
mobility, especially in areas 
without a public transport service 
as citizens are entitled to public 
service. However, transportation 
service and its routes must be 
carefully designed to enable 

the development of effective 
infrastructure and service 
planning.

OPTIMIZING MUSRENBANG 
(DEVELOPMENT PLANNING 
FORUM) IN THE PLANNING 
PROCESS 

Musrenbang is a development planning 
forum that uses participatory approach. 
Musrenbang is required by law to be 
conducted on every government level, 
i.e. from neighborhood, to sub-district 
and district and ultimately on municipal 
level. However, the implementation 
of this forum is not effective as it is 
currently limited by time and communal 
participation.

Musrenbang as a participatory 
budgeting forum has a strict and 
limited schedule. There are only 
two to three months to conduct 
stakeholder meetings on every 
administrative level, from the 
neighborhood to the municipal 
level. The time limitation is a 
challenge to conduct a good 
participatory process and 
propose high quality programs. 
The citizens also tend to have a 
wish list during Musrenbang. It is 
usually focused on neighborhood-
scale infrastructure that affects 
them directly such as the 
sidewalk pavement in their area. 
The citizens must be made aware 
of the overall visions and strategy 
of the city so they can provide a 
relevant and better proposal that 
can affect city widely. 

To better improve the 
Musrenbang, there should be 
a series of pre-Musrenbang. 
They can support the 
compulsory Musrenbang by 
providing additional forums for 
stakeholders. This can increase 
the participation of all citizens, 
including elderly, disabled 
and poor people. Both the 
Musrenbang and pre-Musrenbang 
should also be supported by 

properly trained and skilled 
facilitators.

Therefore, the Semarang 
Development Planning Agency 
needs to prepare a guideline of 
improved Musrenbang process 
and provides intensive technical 
assistance to facilitators in 
order to conduct an effective 
Musrenbang.

Action: Informing 
citizens of the city’s 
vision and Musrenbang 
process; promoting 
and supporting wider 
implementation of pre-
Musrenbang; training for 
trainers for Musrenbang 
facilitators 

Resilience value: A 
well designed and 
executed Musrenbang 
can improve the quality 
of city development 
program. It also 
promotes cohesiveness 
and increases the 
sense of ownership 
of local citizens by 
actively participating in 
development programs. 
Furthermore, it will also

addition, this initiative improves 
the transparency of information 
that allows the public to monitor 
development process in the city, 
including improving effectiveness 
of budget use.

However, the current system 
of E-Musrenbang can only be

People should be able to access 
it as well so they will be informed 
about selected programs and 
participate actively in supporting 
and monitoring the programs.

RESILIENT SEMARANGPorto Alegre is known as the pioneer 
on participatory budgeting. By applying 
resilience perspective in participatory 
budgeting, the city will improve social 
cohesion and strengthen people’s 
understanding of resilience. The goal 
is to create and implement the Index 
Development of Resilience Urbana (IDRU) 
in an action management model for Porto 
Alegre and increase budget 10% from 
current index; 59.4 points and also invest 
at least 10% of the annual budget for 
resilience. This goal requires a transparent 
implementation and control mechanism. 

Transparency will enable communication 
between stakeholders and encourage 
participation which in return will affect 
resilience significantly and reduce losses 
and damage. 

Source: http://100resilientcities.org 

LEARNING FROM PORTO ALEGRE

Rapid population growth in Porto Alegre 
resulted in urban challenges. Housing 
need pushed the population to occupy 
every available space in the city, even 
without infrastructure and property right. 
Conservation areas were turned into new 
residential buildings, which created a 
dangerous situation as some parts of the 
areas are prone to flood and landslide. 
About 13.7% of the total population 
lives in this area. Basic services such as 
electricity, clean water, sanitation, waste 
collection and public transport cannot 
be provided easily. However, the major 
challenge is the ambiguous regulation. 
The administration process is ineffective 
and inefficient, creating a complex 
situation. Moreover, it is difficult to create 
a dialogue between different sectors that 
are involved in the development process, 
resulting in lack of trust and cooperation. 

In solving this issue, Porto Alegre 
established a working group that included 
multi-background stakeholders to build 
an urban resilience plan that identified risk 
areas and educated and alerted residents. 
One of the strategic objectives to achieve 
a resilient Porto Alegre was to have local 
governance that promoted resilience in 
every action and to design a participatory 
budget that contributed to the increased 
resilience of the city.

IMPROVING THE INTEGRATION 
OF PLANNING AND CITY 
BUDGETING

There is an increase in the city revenue 
although most of it comes from the national 
budget. However, the budget is not matched 
by an effective implementation, with high value 
of unspent budget at the end of year. This 
reflects the weakness in the management of 
human resources. Underspent budget equals 
not optimized service for the citizens. The 
encouragement of the integration of planning 
and city budgeting can address this issue. It 
also requires some improvement in leadership.

Planning and city budgeting play 
an important role in determining 
the quality of city programs. 
The effectiveness and quality of 
program implementation depend 
on the quality of the planning and 
city budgeting.

It is necessary to provide regular 
training and technical assistance 
for government officials to arm 
them with better knowledge in 
managing the city budgeting 
process from the start up to 
the evaluation. The training and 
technical assistance includes 
managing, monitoring and

Action: 
Regular training, technical 
assistance and evaluation, 
involving some national

motivate government to 
ensure their job quality.

Resilience value: 
The regular training 
will improve the 
government’s capacity

enable resource sharing. 
Integrated planning that 
implemented properly 
in the city will ensure 
people’s wellbeing, social

and better living quality.

Internal communication between 
all city agencies and offices 
must be improved to harmonize 
city budget planning. It requires 
having representatives from 
all city agencies and offices. 
Coordination between different 
agencies and offices is part 
of efforts to achieve the city’s 
vision and avoid any abuse of 
authority and encourage resource 
sharing. Citizens’ input should be 
considered in planning and city 
budgeting.

Integrated information system 
should include a citizen report 
mechanism. This system will 
encourage a good coordination 
between stakeholders. Citizen 
report mechanism has been 
developed by platform partner 
Ushahidi working together with 
Hysteria, a local community

Citizens must be well informed 
on their tax allocation in public 
service. Transparency and 
accountability will improve 
government performance. Annual 
government program should 
be socialized to the citizens 
regularly, for example every four 
months. The information is not 
limited to the type of program, 
but also budget and details such 
as physical design if it is related 
to construction. Thus, citizens 
can participate in the monitoring

Improvement of monitoring 
system is required to ensure 
a more effective budget 
performance and avoid a lower 
target. Sanction mechanism for 
programs fail to be implemented 
properly or reward mechanism 
for well-performed city agencies 
can be arranged. For example, 
improving the quality of human 
resources is important and the 
Education Office allocates a 
large portion of the city budget. 
However, the implementation and 
budget spending are not optimal. 
Encouraging the stick-and-carrot

However, some of these 
websites are often hacked and 
have problems due to their 
limited capacity. The transition

capacity improvement of 
both the system and server. 
This will accommodate all 
relevant information. It is also 
recommended to improve the 
website’s security.

Transparent information 
that is accessible by

better urban condition. 
For, example, citizens 
can report a crime, which 
means the law can be

PREPARING THE WORKFORCE

Semarang has a higher unemployment rate than 
the provincial and national level. One cause is the 
skill gap between job seekers and job requirements. 
Semarang is also changing their economic direction 
to trade and service sector, while industrial area 
migrated to the outskirt. Semarang workforce must 
be ready and become more responsive in facing 
this situation. They need to be aware of market 
needs and required skills set by the employers. 
The other issue is the workforce capacity. Most job 
seekers are high-school graduates or lower. Low 
qualifications create less competitive workforce in 
Semarang. Therefore, workforce capacity must be 
improved.

always build their capacity more. 
Smart house is a learning hub on 
the neighborhood level where 
people can gather and learn from 
the available shared materials, 
such as books.

By providing books at the “smart 
house” and library, people will 
have access to information and 
knowledge. It is expected that the 
reading interest can be increased 
and eventually achieve capacity 
improvement of Semarang 
citizens. The “smart house” and 
library development can be 
conducted by different levels 
of government, through private 
sector’s CSR program and local 
community, while the facility can 
be managed by the city to allow 
book rotation system.

RESILIENT SEMARANGREALIZING 
RESILIENT CITY

Semarang is still facing many urban challenges before it 
can be resilient. The key to strengthen our resilience is by 
building our capacity. It will only be successful with the 
participation of everyone. 

We will work on meeting the water and 
energy demand in a sustainable manner, 
creating business climate for new 
opportunities, preparing for disaster and 
disease outbreaks better, integrating our 
mobility system, increasing transparency 
of public information and governance as 
well as increasing the competitiveness of 
our human resources. Therefore, Semarang 
can achieve its adequate security, efficient 
mobility and good capacity.

This document acts as the initial plan to 
strengthen our city resilience and also 
in line with the Semarang mid-term and 
long-term development plan. The CRS 
enriches the city’s efforts in building 
resilience by creating multiple resilience 
benefits from each initiative.

This city resilience strategy is an 
ambitious plan. Urban challenges are 
increasing in number and business-
as-usual efforts cannot manage 
these unprecedented challenges. The 
identification of these challenges is 
a result of a thorough and inclusive 
process which captured stakeholders’ 
concern and aspiration.

166

RESILIENT SEMARANGACTION PLANNING

To further implement our resilience 
building, together with the CRO, the 
working groups could safeguard the 
implementation of our initiatives. In the 
following months, more detailed action 
plan will be prepared.  In parallel, the 
scoping of work with potential Platform 
Partners is initiated. During the strategy 
development process, initial listing of 
potential platform partners has been 
listed for each pillar strategy. The detailed 
scoping will begin by organizing workshop 
on New Economic Opportunities by the 
end of 2016.

The monitoring and evaluation mechanism 
should also be regulated under guidance 
from the Resilience Steering Committee. 
Taking into account of our resilience 
assessment and diagnostic study, the 
early assessment which adopted the 
CRF can serve as the baseline study for 
the resilience status. This will guide our 

assessment for future interventions in 
building city resilience as well as to help 
adjust and regularly update our strategy.

The regular update is planned to follow 
the five year mid-term planning cycle, 
similar with the current CRS. Therefore, 
the future CRS will also has the great 
opportunities to be streamline and 
complement the overall city development 
strategy. 

MOVING TOGETHER FOR 
SEMARANG RESILIENCE

Ideas and initiatives in this strategy are 
expected to inspire the city government, 
citizens, business sector and all elements 
in Semarang in acknowledging urban 
challenges and taking part in achieving a 
resilient city. 

Let’s move together to build Resilient 
Semarang!

Urban resilience is the capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, businesses, and systems 
within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter 
what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks 
they experience.

We believe in building our capacity to better 
strengthen our city resilience.
