LETTER FROM 
MICHAEL 
BERKOWITZ

from 100 Resilient Cities

On  behalf  of  100  Resilient  Cities  staff,  I 
want to congratulate Mayor Abel Marti-
nez Duran, Chief Resilience Officer Maria 
Isabel Serrano Dina, and the City of San-
tiago de los Caballeros for the launching 
of  their  Resilience  Strategy,  which  is  an 
important milestone both for the city and 
our collaboration.

These  stresses  further  expose  these 
communities  and  the  rest  of  the  city  to 
acute, unavoidable impacts, such as occu-
rred  last  fall,  when  Hurricanes  Irma  and 
Maria  hit  the  island,  leaving  more  than 
80,000  people  displaced,  350,000  with 
no water, and almost 1.8 million without 
potable water.

Santiago  de  los  Caballeros,  one  of  the 
oldest cities in the Americas, is a prospe-
rous metropolis that keeps playing an un-
derlying role in the economy and culture 
of  the  Dominican  Republic  and  the  rest 
of  the  Caribbean.  As  the  city  continues 
growing  at  a  rapid  pace,  the  Resilience 
Strategy  is  embarking  on  a  preliminary 
project  to  shape  its  expansion  in  such  a 
manner  that  the  city  can  become  stron-
ger and more resilient.

While  city  growth  is  increasingly  impor-
tant for the future of the region, stresses 
have also been created, and must be con-
fronted  if  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  is 
to be resilient in the 21st century. Given 
that  urban  planning  has  kept  pace  with 
rapid  urbanization,  informal  settlement 
has  become  an  outstanding  part  of  the 
landscape,  often  in  areas  that  are  more 
vulnerable from the environmental point 
of  view.  Communities  in  these  areas  su-
ffer from poor public utilities and infras-
tructure  that  has  not  been  established 
anywhere  outside  the  official  city  limits. 

This Resilience Strategy provides a pers-
pective and 45 concrete actions that ad-
dress the shocks and stresses facing the 
city, including investment in infrastructu-
re to improve disaster response and miti-
gation, as well as the creation of mecha-
nisms to regulate land use so that the city 
may extend and develop in a sustainable, 
flexible manner. The strategy also focuses 
on  fostering  a  prosperous,  innovative, 
and  culturally  vibrant  city  through  offe-
ring  municipal  grant  programs,  promo-
ting the city as a tourist destination, and 
investing 
innovations 
and  employment  creation  opportunities. 
The  strategy  acknowledges  the  key  role 
of  El  Yaque  river  as  an  urban  asset  with 
the potential to transform the city. “Viva 
el Yaque” is a project aimed at developing 
a  sustainable  waste  management  pro-
cess, increasing the areas devoted to pu-
blic green spaces, increasing connectivity, 
revitalizing the city’s downtown, creating 
an  ecological  corridor,  and  developing  a 
comprehensive cycling plan. These goals 
will contribute to the city’s resilience.

in  technological 

Through the commitment and hard work 
of  Chief  Resilience  Officer  Maria  Isabel 
Serrano  Dina  and  the  leadership  of  Ma-
yor Abel Martinez Duran, this Resilience 
Strategy is a true reflection of the needs 
and priorities of the city.

While  launching  this  initiative  is  an  im-
portant  achievement,  the  job  is  far  from 
completed.  The  success  of  this  strategy 
is  contingent  on  its  implementation  and 
potential to make the city institutionalize 
resilience in its planning processes and in-
vestments. The whole city as an integra-
ted  ecosystem  capitalizing  on  its  strong 
private sector must undertake the task of 
becoming more efficient in improving the 
lives of those who live in Santiago de los 
Caballeros  and  helping  them  to  become 
more prosperous, particularly those who 
are the most vulnerable.

We  look  forward  to  continuing  our  co-
llaboration with the city as well as to ob-
serving and taking part in this work as it 
develops and unfolds.

LETTER FROM 
ABEL  
MARTÍNEZ

Mayor of the Municipality of 
Santiago de los Caballeros

Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  has  endured 
social  and  natural  disasters  that  have 
made  it  rebuild  the  city  again  and  again. 
The strength of this municipality of great 
men  and  women  throughout  its  history 
lies in their perseverance and willingness 
to keep moving the region forward during 
difficult times. Our society is one that has 
responded  creatively  to  various  challen-
ges,  improvising  strategies  to  adapt  and 
survive in the very short term.

The Resilience Strategy for Santiago de los 
Caballeros, without a doubt, aims for com-
prehensive  planning  and  robust  action  in 
the  face  of  challenges  from  the  accelera-
ted,  unplanned  regional  growth  that  has 
taken place in with no vision for the long 
term. This Resilience Strategy is a specific 
proposal arising from work undertaken in 
various sectors. The proposal is based on 
the  capacities  of  the  territory,  which  are 
aligned  with  the  municipal  land  use  legal 
framework,  my  administration’s  agenda, 
and the municipal development plan. The 

goal  is  to  strengthen  all  our  efforts  to 
achieve  the  2030  vision  in  a  thoughtful, 
resourceful, and robust manner.

We  are  working  towards  renewing  pri-
de in Santiago de los Caballeros, pride in 
the heart of each inhabitant and in every 
corner of the city. We dream of a peace-
ful society that is clean, orderly, and safe 
for  every  citizen.  We  dream  of  a  vibrant 
and cohesive city that thrives again in its 
green areas as well as its cultural and his-
toric spaces. We aim for a sound, diverse 
economy and projects that are sustaina-
ble over time,

The  agreement  executed  with  Rockefe-
ller Foundation to include Santiago de los 
Caballeros in the 100 Resilient Cities pro-
gram reinforces cross-functional regional 
planning that will include a resilience lens 
in the decisions and actions that will lead 
to  building  a  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros 
prepared to face the future with security 
and confidence. 

This  Resilience  Strategy  is  not  only  im-
portant now and for the future of the city, 
it  signifies  the  approach  we  must  follow 
both  domestically  and  regionally  if  we 
want to responsibly face an uncertain fu-
ture in a world that has an unstable clima-
te. We are committed to developing and 
institutionalizing  this Resilence Strategy, 
which will ensure and make concrete a ri-
gorous technical process tailored for San-
tiago de los Caballeros and the challenges 
it faces.

LETTER FROM 
MARÍA ISABEL 
SERRANO DINA

Chief Resilience Officer

This Resilience Strategy proposes to build 
resilience and foster a sense of belonging to 
the  territory  by  encouraging  citizen  invol-
vement and the active, inclusive participa-
tion  of  communities  in  municipal  planning 
and  multi-sector  actions.  The  strategy  is 
based on the city’s demonstrated capacity 
to  face  and  recover  from  the  acute  shoc-
ks  and  chronic  stresses  of  the  past,  but  it 
also prepares us for unexpected events by 
restructuring  our  approach  to  achieving 
a Santiago de los Caballeros that is a safe, 
well-designed, and cohesive city.

Empowering  citizens  and  the  various 
sectors  of  the  municipality  is  key  to 
achieving  each  pillar  and  to  ensuring 
that  resilience  is  considered  in  all  plan-
ning decisions for the region, in environ-
mental  conservation  and  management 
of ecosystem services, and in public and 
private  actions.    Embedding  resilience 
qualities in the plans, policies, programs 
and projects of Santiago de los Caballe-
ros in the short, medium and long term is 
vitally important.

The  critical  challenges  ahead 
include 
air  pollution,  final  waste  disposal,  water 
provisions,  floods,  lack  of  employment 

opportunities,  limited  spaces  for  social 
cohesion,  mobility  focused  on  motor  ve-
hicles,  poor  public  lighting,  public  safety, 
and  gender-based  violence.  These  cha-
llenges  are  interdependent  and  must  be 
jointly addressed by City Hall in collabo-
ration with all sectors of the city to build 
the resilient city we advocate.

The  new  Regional  Zoning  Municipality 
Plan  (PMOT),  which  represents  signifi-
cant progress in the building of resilience, 
starts by regulating land use and defining 
the growth criteria the municipality must 
embrace to reduce natural and man-ma-
de  vulnerability.  Another  PMOT  contri-
bution is that it considers risk in its plan-
ning  and  offers  a  sustainable  vision  for 
land use regulation.

In  other  matters,  the  declaration  by  law 
of Santiago as an ecotourism destination, 
the  recovery  of  the  public  areas  of  San-
tiago  de  los  Caballeros  through  art,  cul-
ture,  gastronomy,  and  the  revitalization 
of  urban  green  spaces  reflect  a  society 
that  has  so  much  to  offer,  we  now  have 
a unique opportunity to develop the city 
as  a  tourist  destination  by  diversifying 
the  economy,  creating  new  employment 

opportunities  and  strengthening  econo-
mic growth.

The  greatest  challenge  we  face  is,  with 
no  doubt,  recovery  of  Yaque  del  Norte 
river  and  its  close  environment.  The  will 
of each citizen, the academy, the business 
community,  industries,  non-governmen-
tal  organizations,  local  institutions,  the 
City  Hall  and  the  National  Government 
shall  be  the  key  joint  effort  to  recover 
this very significant and iconic space that, 
beyond being a source of water, is the li-
ttle-remembered  soul  and  beat  awaiting 
to be admired again by those who used to 
take pleasure on its beauty and splendor.

EXECUTIVE  
SUMMARY

D

Healthy, Eco-effective and
Ecologically Sensitive Santiago
to the Yaque River

The Resilience Strategy for Santiago de los Ca-
balleros  describes  the  need  to  assess,  define, 
and  implement  mechanisms  to  strategically 
respond to acute shocks, such as earthquakes 
and floods, and to chronic stresses the city un-
dergoes daily, such as unorganized and unplan-
ned growth, urban sprawl, lack of social cohe-
sion, and poor urban facilities. Such challenges 
are  barriers  to  achieving  a  resilient  city  and 
dramatically affect its citizens’ life quality. The 
Santiago de los Caballeros Resilience Strategy 
is therefore intended as a resource for building 
robust response and management systems to 
address disasters, to strengthen the city’s cul-
tural resources and vitality, and to strengthen 
its natural, economic, and social structure.

In  2015  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  was  se-
lected  to  be  in  the  second  group  of  cities  that 
became  part  of  100  Resilient  Cities  initiative 
(100RC) sponsored by the Rockefeller Founda-
tion. The initiative’s purpose is to support 100 
cities  around  the  world  in  resilience  building 
on an urban scale. Being selected as one of the 
program’s  second  set  of  100  cities  has  helped 
Santiago de los Caballeros understand the vul-
nerabilities and challenges faced by the city, as-
sess its capacity to respond to them and apply a 
comprehensive,  holistic  planning  methodology 
with a resilience lens to them, starting with the 
local government’s implementation plan and the 
proposals  emerging  from  the  region’s  various 
sectors and institutions.

As part of the first phase of the process, a workshop 
was held to study perceptions and factors that have 
an influence on the resilience of Santiago de los Ca-
balleros. Then, several studies and plans were re-
viewed, including the Inter-American Development 
Bank  under  its  Emerging  and  Sustainable  Cities 
Program, the strategic plan of the Santiago Strate-
gic Development Board, and the action plan of San-
tiago  municipality  Mayor’s  Office  were  reviewed. 
During the review, the sustainability status of the 
city  as  well  as,  its  vulnerability  to  climate  change, 
among other topics, were analyzed. Next, the Re-
silience  Strategy  work  plan  was  introduced.  The

plan  was  validated  in  workshops  involving 
the various sectors of Santiago society, with 
the  members  of  the  Resilience  Committee 
assembled by the mayor, and in 145 surveys 
on  perceptions  of  natural  and  man-made 
shocks and stresses. 

As  the  new  mayor  took  office,  the  data 
revalidation  work  resumed.  Documents 
processed at the time were reviewed and 
a series of consulting processes took pla-
ce  with  key  city  stakeholders  to  update 
the  action  previously  identified.  At  this 
point the Basin Plan, among other docu-
ments, was created and the vision of the 
current  Municipality  Management  Plan 
was  developed.  At  this  stage,  the  action 

validation and prioritization process was 
started, first with an opportunity assess-
ment  toolkit  designed  by  the  100RC 
program. The goal of the process was to 
highlight the resilience value of proposed 
actions and to ensure that they did indeed 
respond  to  the  shocks  and  stresses  on 
the city. In addition, four workshops were 
organized  with  three  multi-sector  focus 
groups  and  one  focus  group  consisting 
of  City  Hall  managers.  The  workshops 
were intended to foster a sense of social 
responsibility. They were also to provide 
feedback on the work conducted, provide 
an  opportunity  to  develop  alliances,  and 
prioritize  the  most  resilient  and  feasible 
actions to be included in this document. 

The  last  step  of  the  validation  process 
was  the  final  review  of  the  city  Resilien-
ce  Committee  composed  of  various  key 
stakeholders  of  the  municipality  and 
headed by the mayor. When this process 
concluded, the preparation and writing of 
the Santiago de los Caballeros Resilience 
Strategy  was  resumed  and  it  was  laun-
ched  in  May  2018  so  that  implementa-
tion could begin forthwith. 

The multiple threats and high level of ex-
posure  due  to  the  city’s  physical  and  so-
cioeconomic  vulnerability  results  in  risk 
that is distributed throughout the region. 
The  pillars  and  their  proposed  concrete 
actions have targets, as shown below.

Scattered,  uncontrolled  growth  of  urban  sprawl 
is  a  challenging  trend  that  significantly  increases 
the  natural  vulnerabilities  and  exposure  to  risk 
of  some  communities.  This  first  pillar  proposes 
actions  to  control  the  expansion  of  urban  sprawl, 
reduce natural vulnerabilities, and improve the ca-
pacity for prevention, response, and mitigation of 
acute shocks.

This pillar is intended to strengthen human capa-
cities,  expand  employment  choices,  and  support 
the construction of a resilient economy based on a 
Santiago de los Caballeros that promotes the city, 
its  culture  and  history,  as  a  tourist  product.  The 
aim  is  to  create  an  economic  environment  with  a 
strong labor force and healthy supply and demand, 
one in which a prosperous workforce and an inno-
vative economy can develop and thrive.

This pillar responds to the need for participatory pro-
cesses that are fundamental to a democracy and that 
foster a sense of belonging in all citizens to their region 
and its common assets. This pillar seeks to strengthen 
institutional and community capacities, so that ever-
yone can work together for a safer city where human 
dignity is respected.

This  pillar  proposes  the  development  of  environ-
mentally effective mechanisms for creating a holis-
tic environment for the city and its green areas, an 
environment that is connected to and supportive of 
human needs. This involves citizens at the outset in 
all aspects of strategic planning and recognizes the 
role nature can play in helping to resolve urban cha-
llenges. The goal is effective management and con-
servation of the natural infrastructure of the city.

CONTEXT  
OF THE CITY

CURRENT  
RADIOGRAPHY

Urban reality

Santiago municipality, with the city of Santia-
go de los Caballeros as the municipal seat, is 
one of the municipalities that are part of San-
tiago Province. The Resilience Strategy fra-
mework addresses the territory from three 
approaches:  Santiago de los Caballeros city, 
which is the city center; Santiago municipa-
lity, which is composed of various municipal 
districts; and the city and metropolitan area¹. 
The  latter  represents  the  conurbation2  of 
Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  city  Pontifical 
with neighboring municipalities, such as Villa 
Gonzalez, Tamboril, Puñal, and Licey al Me-
dio, as well as the municipal districts of San 
Francisco  de  Jacagua,  Hato  del  Yaque,  La 
Canela, and Pedro Garcia. 

The topography of Santiago de los Caballe-
ros is mainly a valley. The city sits between 
the  Cordillera  Septentrional  and  the  Cor-
dillera  Central  where  the  Yaque  del  Norte 
River crosses the valley. It has humid warm 
weather,  annual  average  rainfall  between 
1,500 and 2,000 mm and average tempera-
ture between 25°C and 28°C (CDES, 2002). 

1. This area is not an administrative or legal enti-
ty. Defined for this study, it consists of Santiago 
and  adjoining  municipalities,  especially  where 
there  is  conurbation  or  merging  due  to  urban 
sprawl. The Metropolitan Area of Santiago de los 
Caballeros  (AMSC)  includes  a  zone  with  urban 
sprawl and territories that are part of the urban 
dynamics of the city. 

2. “Conurbation” is defined as a set of rural co-
res  initially  independently  organized  around  a 
city, but that have become an urbanized conti-
nuum, clearly dependent on the city, due to the 
city’s growth, Conurbation happens at a space 
we will refer to as peri- urban. A peri-urban en-
vironment  is  the  area  surrounding  a  city  that 
provides  a  border  between  the  rural  and  the 
urban, but that cannot be properly considered 
one or the other.

100 RESILIENT  
CITIES 
INICIATIVE

URBAN  
RESILIENCE

100RC has defined urban resilience as 
“the capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses and systems within a 
city to survive, adapt and grow no matter what 
kind of shocks and stresses they experience.”

The 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative, fun-
ded by the Rockefeller Foundation, was created 
in 2013 on the 100th anniversary of the Rocke-
feller Foundation and in response to three trends 
of  the  21st  century:  urbanization,  globalization, 
and climate change. 100RC is devoted to helping 
cities in all parts of the world to become more re-
silient to the physical, social, and economic cha-
llenges that have an increasing importance.

This  initiative  supports  the  adoption  and  incor-
poration  of  a  resilience  view  that  includes  not 
only  acute  shocks,  such  as  earthquakes,  floods, 
and disease outbreaks, but also chronic stresses 
that weaken the structure of a city on a daily ba-
sis or in a cyclical manner. Examples of such stres-
ses are high unemployment rates, an overloaded 
or  poor  public  transportation  system,  endemic 
violence or chronic shortages of food and water. 
By  addressing  both  shocks  and  stresses,  a  city 
can better respond to adverse events, adapt, and 
have a greater capacity to offer basic functions to 
its residents in good and bad times.

Member cities of the 100RC initiative have the 
following  resources  and  benefits  that  will  aid 
each in creating a resilience roadmap:

1.  Financial  and  logistic  support  to  establish  a 
new  and  innovative  position  in  the  Municipal 
Government: A Chief Resilience Officer (CRO), 
who will lead the resilience efforts of the city.

2. Technical assistance from strategic partners 
so  that  the  Resilience  Department  can  lead 
stakeholders  in  developing  a  strategy  that  will 
serve as a resilience guide for the city. 

3.  Access  to  toolkits,  service  providers,  and 
collaborators  from  the  private,  public  and 
non-profit  sectors  able  to  aid  cities  in  develo-
ping  and  implementing  their  resilience  strate-
gies.  Some  of  the  current  “platform  partners” 
include  data  analysis  companies,  insurers,  ar-
chitects,  and  energy  experts.  Cities  also  have 
access to a service catalogue available through 
an online platform.

The program develops 
in these phases:

6-9  
MONTHS

 

PHASE 1

Quick diagnosis 

and involvement of 

stakeholders

PHASE 2

In-depth diagnosis, 
centered on feasible 

initiatives.

4.  Membership in the 100RC Network, a 
global network of cities where Chief Resi-
lience Officers are able to share best prac-
tices, solve issues jointly, r and learn from 
each other and other resilience experts.

100RC not only intends to help individual 
cities to become more resilient, but also to 
facilitate the creation of a resilience deve-
lopment global practice.

The 100RC Resilience Strategy Process is 
a 6- to 9-month effort led by the CRO to 
develop a resilience road map for the city 
and create a set of potential initiatives.

02100 RESILIENT CITIES INICIATIVERESILIENTSANTIAGO DE LOS CABALLEROS  THE  
MEANING OF 
SANTIAGO  
DE LOS  
CABALLEROS 
RESILIENT

The  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  Resi-
lience  Strategy  is  grounded  on  a  study 
of natural and man-made vulnerabilities 
as  well  as,  on  the  opportunities  arising 
from development needs, the capacity to 
adapt, and the potential for reinvention 
at  a  local  government  level.  The  resul-
ting product of this process is the ability 
to  respond  to  major  acute  shocks  and 
chronic  stresses  in  a  multidisciplinary, 
interinstitutional  manner  that  spans 
across  all  sectors  of  the  city.  The  work 
methodology  incorporates  a  resilience 
lens  for  the  effective  planning  and  buil-
ding of the territory.

Santiago  de  los  Caballeros,  the  main 
city of Cibao region and the second lar-
gest city of the DominicanRepublic, has 
a  strategic  location  30  kilometers  away 
from  one  of  the  largest  trade  ports, 

Puerto  Plata.  For  years,  it  has  been  the 
city that receives people from the coun-
try. It is also characterized as an impor-
tant  industrial  development  area,  not 
only  for  the  country  but  for  the  region. 
The  Yaque  del  Norte  River,  which  cros-
ses  the  city,  is  an  urban  asset  with  the 
potential  to  transform  the  city  of  San-
tiago.  These  aspects  of  the  city  present 
challenges  to  which  a  resilient  Santiago 
de los Caballeros must respond.

The  city  is  located  at  the  Hispaniola 
fault  of  the  Cordillera  Septentrional, 
translating  into  an  unpredictable  risk 
of earthquakes. Moreover, for years the 
Yaque del Norte River has been neglec-
ted, becoming a dumping ground for so-
lid and liquid waste that is undermining 
the health and potential of this natural 
water body.

36

Santiago de los Caballeros Resilient means 
that the city is prepared to go forward af-
ter  natural  disasters  such  as  earthquakes 
and  floods.  It  must  also  create  a  dynamic 
economic environment that is inclusive, in 
which opportunities exist for everyone. The 
creativity  and  cultural  pride  of  its  people 
are of paramount importance, and the city 
must  capitalize  on  the  economic  benefits 
that  are  possible  for  all  from  the  environ-
ment, tourism, and river transportation.

Making  resilience  the  overarching  princi-
ple of city planning will enable integrated, 
sustainable,  and  beneficial  development 
for  all  citizens  in  the  short,  medium.  and 
long term. The payoff, under this resilience 
lens,  will  be  a  deeper  sense  of  belonging 
and commitment to a Santiago de los Ca-
balleros that is facing the future in a safe, 
robust, reflexive, integrated, inclusive, re-
dundant, and resourceful manner.

02100 RESILIENT CITIES INICIATIVERESILIENTSANTIAGO DE LOS CABALLEROS  TOOLS AND  
METHODOLOGY

For a consistent exploration of the meaning 
of resilience by cities around the world, 100RC 
promotes a framework that enables each city to 
analyze its own data and articulate its challenges 
and opportunities from a resilience perspective.

The  City  Resilience  Framework,  or  CRF, 
prepared  by  the  Rockefeller  Foundation 
and  Arup29  provides  a  common  language 
that enables cities to share knowledge and 
experiences. This CRF articulates the con-
cept  of  urban  resilience  in  an  accessible 
manner  and  enables  reporting  on  urban 
planning projects and city investments ba-
sed on measurable evidence. 

The CRF is composed of 4 dimensions, 12 
factors, and 52 indicators that help articu-
late the processes and capacity the city has 
for resilience building. The CRF represents 
the  resilience  of  a  city  and  its  capacity  to 
face of a wide range of shocks and stresses. 
This  framework  provides  a  lens  through 
which the complexity of a city may be un-
derstood and is an aid in assessing its reco-
very capacity. The CRF helps cities identify 
critical areas and design initiatives and pro-
grams to improve their resilience capacity.

7 

Qualities

In the extensive research conducted by the Rockefeller Foun-
dation and Arup to develop the resilience framework, a set of 
qualities  were  identified  that  describe  the  behavior  or  per-
formance of resilient systems that enable them to withstand, 
respond, and adapt more readily to shocks and stresses. The 
following  qualities  determine  the  manner  in  which  the  sys-
tems  proposed  in  the  actions  introduced  in  the  Resilience 
Strategy  address  potential  acute  shocks  and  chronic  stres-
ses, including how these systems contribute to creating a re-
silience framework.

DEVELOPMENT 
PROCESS

ENGAGEMENT OF 
CITY SECTORS IN 
THE WORKSHOPS

The CRO conducted interviews with offi-
cials, technical staff, and key stakeholders 
in the metropolitan region, and she orga-
nize  6  participatory  workshops  in  which 
59 representatives from all sectors of the 
city were invited to prioritize crossfunc-
tional and feasible actions.

The  development  and  implementation  of  the 
Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  Resilience  Strategy 
is  a  unique  opportunity  to  design  innovative, 
collective  and  creative  solutions  that  will  ena-
ble  the  city  and  its  communities  to  be  better 
prepared  to  respond  to  acute  shocks,  overco-
me  stresses,  address  current  issues,  and  face 
future challenges. The 100RC proposal helped 
develop the city’s Resilience Strategy with a ho-
listic and integrated approach that encouraged 
the participation of key actors in Santiago de los 
Caballeros,  a  broad  range  of  regional  institu-
tions and provincial departments of the Central 
Government,  the  private  sector,  the  academic, 
sector, and civil society.

The first phase of the strategy development pro-
cess  began  with  the  creation  of  an  inventory  of 
actions that could potentially build resilience and 
a  review  of  the  city’s  physical  assets.  Using  the 
100RC assets and risk tool, an analysis was made 
of how shocks and stresses on Santiago de los Ca-
balleros could affect the city. In addition, as part of 
the validation process, 250 Santiago citizens were 
surveyed and their perceptions  of the current sw-
tatus of the Santiago urban zone was compiled.

A  perception  workshop  was  also  conducted 
in which more than 60 people studied factors 
that influence the city’s resilience. The results 
were reported and summarized in the Prelimi-
nary  Resilience  Assessment  (PRA),  which  was 
subsequently validated by the Resilience Com-
mittee. The Resilience Committee then deter-
mined a resilience baseline for Santiago de los 
Caballeros, which includes the threats the city 
faces and its strength and capacity for building 
resilience.

The  consensus  and  information  consolidation 
that took place in the first phase made it easier 
to start the second phase with a unified view of 
a resilience approach that would foster innova-
tion. Starting with the Municipal Development 
Plan  developed  by  Santiago  City  Hall  to  res-
pond to the short-term needs of the city, some 
of the other plans and projects consulted were 
the  National  Development  Strategy,  Santiago’s 
Strategy  Plan,  Santiago  Sustainable  City  ICES-
BID,  APEDI  development  projects,  Santiago 
Solidario  projects,  CARITAS  projects,  VOCES

Strategy, the best practices of other cities 
in  the  100RC  network  were  analyzed.  In 
addition,  international  exchanges,  such 
as  the  100RC  network  exchange  at  San-
tiago de Chile for cities with urban rivers, 
and  focus  groups  to  validate  actions  also 
played  a  role.  As  a  result,  the  Strategy 
Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  Resilient,  and 
its goals and the actions presented in this 
document, are the result of contributions 
by  all  the  stakeholders  in  the  community 
who  engaged  in  this  work.  Six  participa-
tory  workshops  on  the  pillar  topics  were 
conducted  in  January  2018  at  Santiago 
de los Caballeros. They brought key stake-
holders together to as-sess and prioritize, 
through  a  resilience  lens,  those  actions 
with the greatest feasibility and the most 
potential for contributing to resilience.

NETWORK EXCHANGE

One of the offerings of the 100RC initiative is an international gathe-
ring led by Chief Resilience Officers that focuses on addressing common 
challenges. This exchange offers the CROs and their teams an opportu-
nity to develop relationships among themselves and to share the ideas 
and experience gained from using their cities as living laboratories for 
resilience  strategies  and  their  implementation.  These  international 
meetings  serve  as  a  learning  and  solutions  distribution  channel  that 
allows CROs to share and communicate the needs of their cities to the 
public and private sectors and then return home with new knowledge 
and ideas upon which they can act. Meanwhile,100RC works to publi-
cly share their knowledge and experience, so that cities in and out the 
100RC network can learn best practices for building resilience.

This  inclusive  process  made  the  most  of 
the  existing  knowledge  and  projects  wi-
thin the community. It acknowledged the 
strengths  and  capacities  of  the  city  and 
accessed new information sources to en-
rich the analysis and identify new stake-
holders, potential partners, and projects. 
And while this participatory process pro-
vided a strong foundation for the Santia-
go de los Caballeros Resilient Strategy, it 
also  offered  an  opportunity  to  establish 
new  and  closer  relationships  among  the 

50

various  departments  of  Santiago  City 
Hall.  The  process  spanned  institutions 
and disciplines, and resulted in everyone 
becoming focused on a common target— 
urban resilience.

Santiago de los Caballeros has incorporated 
the Resilience Office into the City Hall orga-
nizational  chart,  made  the  concept  of  resi-

lience part of the Municipal Regional Zoning 
Plan, and created a Resilience Committee to 
consult and advise the city.

The committee is composed of key repre-
sentatives  from  various  agencies  of  the 
Municipality,  city  officials,  and  members 
from  the  private  and  public  sectors  and 
civil society.

From its founding in 1495 by Admiral Chris-
topher Columbus, Santiago de los Caballe-
ros has a history of events that have tested 
its capacity for resilience. The city has faced 
acute  natural  shocks  and  resurfaced  again 
and again due to the strength of its people. 
It has even changed its geographic location 
to face and respond to adverse events. The 
timeline  shows  the  most  powerful  events 
that have made Santiago de los Caballeros 
and its residents resilient.

HISTORY OF RESILIENCE03RESILIENTSANTIAGO DE LOS CABALLEROS  SHOCKS AND  
STRESSES

The city developed with no urban planning 
or land regulation, which has triggered a 
series of sudden, powerful events that have 
weakened the capacity of the territory to 
protect the quality of life for its citizens.

Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  h  a  s  experienced 
acute shocks and chronic stresses throughout 
its history resulting in a city plagued with social 
inequity,  scattered  services,  growing  natural 
and man-made challenges.

A  huge  threat  to  sprawling  and  vulnerable 
Santiago de los Caballeros lies in its economic 
growth model. The economy of the city great-
ly depends on industry and trade as the basis 
for its economic development. However, these 
sectors directly or indirectly contribute to the 
degradation  of  the  city’s  urban  green  infras-
tructure, whether due to proximity, production 
methods,  improper  handling  of  raw  materials, 
or  waste  dumping.  In  addition,  the  demand 
from these sectors for cheap labor provided by 
people emigrating from rural areas and reloca-
ting in zones with greater natural risks further 
impacts the green infrastructure.

The  accelerated  population  growth  and  unre-
gulated  expansion  of  the  territory  unleashed 
a  false  perception  of  opportunities  and  ope-
ned  the  door  to  unemployment,  marginality, 

violence, citizen insecurity, and the inability of 
municipal authorities to provide basic services 
to the people. From its inception, Santiago de 
los  Caballeros  has  been  forced  to  adapt  and 
respond to a host of unexpected events and to 
reinvent itself each time. 

During the first phase of the Resilience Strate-
gy process, the main shocks and stresses that 
have  affected  and  continue  to  affect  the  city 
were  identified  through  perception  surveys 
and  the  100RC  Assets  and  Risk  Tool.  In  the 
perception  study  conducted  in  2015  as  part 
of  the  Preliminary  Resilience  Assessment  of 
Santiago  de  los  Caballeros,  145  people  were 
interviewed,  and  they  identified  the  shocks 
and  stresses  of  greatest  concern  for  various 
sectors of Santiago de los Caballeros.

The  results  of  the  surveys  conducted  in  the 
first phase identified the hydrometeorological 
risks  aggravated  by  climate  change,  such  as 
acute floods and extreme droughts, as the main 
shocks.  Infrastructure  failures,  earthquakes, 
and disease outbreaks were also identified.

SHOCKS

They may be

(fires,

OR SOCIAL

THE CITY IS EXPOSED RELATIVE TO
CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED CHART

The team assessed the risk level posed by 
shocks to the city using the 100 Resilient 
Cities Assets and Risk Tool, which was also 
used as part of the Preliminary Resi lience 
Assessment of Santiago de los Caballeros. 
The risk level was measured relative to the 
probability of an event occurring in the fu-
ture and its maximum consequence.

As  the  two  risk  assessment  activities  re-
vealed,  for  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  the 
shocks  presenting  the  highest  risk  are 
severe  storms,  disease  outbreaks,  earth-
quakes, floods and chronic diseases.

In  addition,  the  surveys  identified  vio-
lence, social inequality, unemployment, 
informal  urban  settlements  at  water 
risk areas, and noise contamination as 
main chronic stresses.

Interviewees  also  identified  phy-
sical  stresses  related  to  lack  of 
access  to  infrastructure  and  ser-
vices  in  the  most  vulnerable  nei-
ghborhoods  of  the  city  as  well  as 
the  obsolescence  and  inadequate  
redundancy of such infrastructure. 

Mobility  was  another  issue  identi-
fied by interviewees.

Lack  of  space  for  pedestrians  and 
non-motor  mobility  are  a  permanent 
pressure  that  limits  a  large  percentage 
of  the  population  from  walking  in  the 
city and from using bicycles as a means 
of transportation and recreation. Adding 
to this stress is the poor lighting of public 
spaces,  streets,  and  avenues,  which  is  a 
challenge  that  considerably  increases 
people’s perception of insecurity.

STRESSES 
are factors that

add periodic pressure to a 
city such as a drought, water 

shortages, gender violence, 
high unemployment rate, and 

poor public transportation.

ACTION  
PRIORITIZATION 
PROCESS

The  work  process  to  build  this  strategy  took  as 
its starting point a review of 13 documents. 7 of 
them  are  studies  and  action  plans  for  the  city30, 
from which 500 actions were identified; the other 
6 documents relate to public policy and the laws 
governing the territory31. A series of filters were 
used  to  prioritize  the  actions  from  these  docu-
ments.  The  filters  are  tools  designed  to  identify 
the  actions  that  contribute  the  most  to  building 
resilience based on their resilience qualities, the 
availability of funds for their implementation, the 
will of the actors in charge to execute them, and 
the resilience dividends they provide.

The first filter consisted of an exploration of ac-
tions  responding  to  challenges  identified  in  the 
surveys  and  perception  workshops  of  the  first 
phase,  in  which  shocks  and  stresses  of  the  city 
were detailed. Out of the 500 actions from the 7 
documents, 220 were selected and then grouped 
per the challenges to which they responded with 
the aim to create potential goals for each group. 
This process concluded with a hierarchy matrix in 
which  actions  were  grouped  by  tentative  pillars 
according to the challenges they would address. 
Lastly, the actions were inserted in the ideas bank 
of  the  Opportunity  Assessment  Toolkit  (OAT 
Opportunity  Assessment  Tool32).  This  tool  res-
ponds to questions such as these; How many cha-
llenges does this initiative solve? What resilience 
qualities does it present? Who is in charge? Does 
it have a budget? An important result of this last 
filter is that 90% of the actions have a budget that 
can be implemented.

The second filter enabled a reduction of the 
hierarchy  matrix  to  120  actions  that  build 
resilience after aligning the hierarchy matrix 
with public policy and the laws governing the 
territory, thus ensuring that these actions are 
grounded in law.

The third filter enabled the reduction of tho-
se 120 actions down to 79 actions by cross-
mapping  the  hierarchy  matrix  with  the  City 
Hall  Municipal  Development  Plan,  strengthe-
ning the capacity to implement the strategic 
actions. An interesting finding resulted from 
this: A great portion of the Municipal Develo-
pment Plan matches the resilience goals iden-
tified during the process.

For  the  fourth  filter,  the  three  multi-sector 
focus  groups  validated  the  79  actions.  The 
groups were composed of key stakeholders: 
representatives  from  the  academic  world, 
governmental  institutions,  organized  civil 
society, non-profit organizations, and the en-
trepreneurial sector. The stakeholders were 
divided into groups based on their expertise. 
Thus, there was a group for pillar A, a second 
group  for  pillars  B  and  C,  and  a  third  mul-
ti-sector group for pillar D. The fourth focus 
group  was  organized  with  all  the  directors 
and  managers  of  the  City  Departments.  5 
actions were the result of the prioritization 
exercises during these 4 workshops.

The fifth filter, consisted in the validation of 
the resulting 51 actions from the fourth filter 
and their socialization with the City Resilien-

ce  Committee,  which  defined  45  strategic 
actions that can build resilience for Santiago.

As  part  of  the  socialization  and  empower-
ment work of the various stakeholders, the 
Chief  Resilience  Officer  held  18  individual 
meetings  with  directors  from  City  Hall 
as  well  as  26  meetings  with  stakeholders 
from  civil  society,  such  as  Santiago  Solida-
rio,  Sociedad  Ecológica  del  Cibao,  Santia-
go  Somos  Todos,  Tú  eres  el  Pais,  Santiago 
Aqueduct  and  Sewage  Council,  Provincial 
Department  of  the  Environment  and  Na-
tural  Resources,  Provincial  Department  of 
the Ministry of Women, Santiago Strategic 
Development Board, Núcleo de Apoyo a la 
Mujer,  Civil  Defence,  Dominican  Founda-
tion for Risk Management, and the Tax Pro-
tection Office.

The Resilience Strategy consists of 4 pillars, 
10 goals, and 45 actions defined during the 
strategy development process. They are ba-
sed on the discovery areas identified during 
the Preliminary Resilience Assessment33 and 
its analysis of plans, projects, and programs, 
and  on  multi-sector  consultation  with  key 
stakeholders in Santiago de los Caballeros.

Each pillar describes the challenges and the 
context in which the work of the Resilien-
ce Strategy is to be undertaken. Next, the 
pillars  and  the  goals  for  each  are  defined, 
and the actions are organized under these. 
In  addition,  a  description  and  a  resilience 
benefit for each action are presented. Also 
stated  are  the  action  type,  status,  imple-
mentation  time,  individual  in  charge,  and 
other actors involved. The Resilience Stra-
tegy, importantly, also proposes monitoring 
metrics for each action, which is a first step 
in monitoring the implementation process 
for these actions.

33.  The  Preliminary  Resilience  Assessment 
(PRA)  is  the  resulting  summary  of  the  work 
conducted  in  workshops,  prior  studies  and 
surveys reviewed by the Resilience Commit-
tee during Phase I. The PRA includes threats 
to the city, the city’s strengths, and its capaci-
ties for building resilience.

CHALLENGES

The first pillar of the Resilience Strategy is the need to 
strengthen infrastructure, tools, and mechanisms to 
build a city that is able to respond, adapt, and grow in 
a resilient manner in the face of natural disasters.

Santiago de los Caballeros has a well do-
cumented seismic history of several ear-
thquakes  of  great  magnitude  that  have 
caused the city to be rebuilt many times 
and even to move its location due to geo-
logical faults. To the northeast of the city, 
crossing  through  Gurabo  and  Jacagua 
and next to the Cordillera Septentrional, 
is  the  currently  active  Northern  Fault 
(Septen-trional). To the Southwest is the 
Hispa-niola  Fault,  which  is  potentially 
active.  This  natural  element  is  part  of  a 
fault  sys-tem  that  historically  has  crea-
ted  telluric  movement  along  the  island 
of around 7.2 degrees’ magnitude on the 
Richter  sca-le  (Franco  y  Peña,  2003b). 
Thus,  per  the  Sustainable  City  Santia-
go  de  los  Caballeros  Plan  (ICES,  2015), 
records of the last 500 years show that 
about 10 events have caused considera-
ble damage on the island. Santiago de los 
Caballeros has grown towards the geo-
logical fault areas, and in the largest vul-
nerability zone there is the high pro-ba-
bility of floods and collapses34. The lack 
of  regional  planning,  the  accelerated 
growth  caused  by  urban  development, 
and  the  lack  of  a  regulatory  framework 
for land use significantly increase the risk 
of natural disasters. 13% of homes fail to 
comply  with  the  habitability  standards 
defined by government most of these ho-
mes are dwellings located in risk zones. 
 
Santiago  de 
los  Caballeros  has  also 
been  affected  by  great  floods  resulting 
from natural events, such as hurricanes 
and  tropical  storms.  In  general,  floods 

affect the city because there is no effec-
tive sewage network or spillways. In ad-
di-tion, maintenance is critical to prevent 
the sewage network from being clogged 
by garbage, sand, and stones, as well as 
to  avoid  deterioration  over  time.  When 
floods  occur  along  with  erosion,  they 
worsen the quality of the water ways due 
to  sedimentation  and  contamination35. 
Gullies  are  buried  by  construc-tion  at 
the surface, and rivers deviate and suffer 
loss of their river beds, which affects the 
lowerlying  zones  of  the  city.  For  exam-
ple, Hurricane Olga in 2007 left 14 dead 
in  the  country,  34,480  disaster  victims, 
and  6,896  homes  damaged,  partly  due 
to  the  unusual  release  of  water  from 
the Tavera Dam by the authorities of the 
Dominican Institute of Water Resources 
(Indhri). The water release caused floo-
ding  that  left  areas  near  the  Yaque  del 
Norte  Ri-ver,  such  as  Nibaje,  Ensanche 
Bermudez,  Baracoa,  under  water.  Ten 
years later, in 2017, Hurricane Maria left 
58,000 displaced people, 128 aqueducts 
out of service, 1,752,415 people with no 
potable water, and 350,000 households 
with no electric power. The damage cau-
sed by the hurricane rose to more than 
RD $3,000 million.

Another  major  challenge  is  the  lack  of 
capacity  and  resources  to  respond  to 
emergencies. Notwithstanding the avai-
lability  of  institutions  and  entities  that 
can provide aid, the lack of coordination 
and team work both for prevention and 
response is a vulnerability that must be 

78

addressed for emergency situations ari-
sing  from  natural  disasters.  At  present, 
the  one  fire  department  station  in  San-
tiago de los Caballeros not only lacks the 
infrastructure to respond adequately to 
the  city’s  fire  and  rescue  emergencies, 
but also suffers from the poor quality of 
its physical infrastructure.

34. The building of housing developments and 
housing areas near the Septentrional fault, to-
gether  with  the  poor  quality  of  the  buildings, 
many  of  which  (schools,  hospitals  and  clinics, 
institutional  buildings)  were  built  before  the 
first  Seismic  Code  of  1979,  increases  the  vul-
nerability of those who live there. The risks in-
volved  are  high,  especially  when  the  buildings 
are  built  over  clay  or  fill  dirt  soils.  The  study 
performed  by  Fundoger  regarding  the  quality 
of Santiago buildings shows that about 80% of 
the  schools  in  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  are 
below the acceptable level and as such, may not 
properly withstand an earthquake.
35. By 1995 about 2.0 m3/s of pollutants (do-
mestic and industrial) entered the Yaque River 
untreated  through  eight  water  sources  and 
their tributaries (streams and gullies). By 2010 
this was reduced to 1.46 m3/s. The numbers su-
ggest that the volume of untreated waste water 
was reduced by 27% (PES, 2010).

CHALLENGES

The second pillar of this Resilience Strategy aims 
to build a prosperous economy by diversification 
that encourages innovation, new job opportunities, 
entrepreneurship, and a renewal of art and culture that 
will make Santiago de los Caballeros a popular tourist 
destination for its culture, history, and eco-tourism.

Ongoing  migration  from  rural  areas  of 
people  seeking  a  better  quality  of  life 
requires  an  investment  in  eradicating 
illiteracy  so  that  these  demographic 
groups  may  fully  participate  in  the  eco-
nomic growth of the city and not become 
a burden on the region. Incontrast, Santia-
go de los Caballeros is a host to substantially 
young, educated residents, and the home of 
many  famous  universities.  and  yet  job  trai-
ning must be expanded in the municipality as 
must job availability. The existing job mar-
ket  does  not  meet  the  demand  created 
by students who are graduating from the 
metropolitan  universities  and  technical 
training  centers.  Much  of  the  problem 
lies  in  the  lack  of  permanent  jobs  and 
economic  incentives  for  entrepreneurs 
to  transform  their  ideas  into  concrete 
projects and there is not a centralized or 
formal job database to post job offerings 
for job seekers.

Economically  speaking,  Santiago  de  los 
Caballeros is the axis of progress for the 
northern and central regions of the coun-
try, and has a special influence on the na-
tional economy. The economy of the city of 
Santiago is mainly based on the production 
and sale of agricultural and livestock pro-
ducts,  trade,  banking,  call  centers,  health 
services, and education. The industrial-free 

98

zone of the city of Santiago hosts 23% of 
the  country’s  companies  and  produces 
24%  of  its  exports36,  and  a  total  of  155 
companies  are  headquartered  in  15  in-
dustrial parks, that is, 30% of the country’s 
companies are located in the municipality. 
The  primary  direct  employment  driver  is 
the trade and hotel sector, followed by the 
industrial  sector,  representing  29.2%  and 
18.3% of the employed population, respec-
tively.  However,  for  2010  the  percentage 
of employed people in the city was estima-
ted to be 41.4% of the total population of 
Santiago municipality (ONE, 2010a), while 
employment by 2015 was about 54.4% of 
the employed population, per data from an 
ICES study (2015). 

in cities that depend on tourism. However, 
the physical condition of these markets is 
an environmental problem for the city, gi-
ven their continuous generation of organic 
waste, which aggravates the markets’ alre-
ady poor sanitary conditions.

The limited number of jobs available, in ad-
dition to low diversification in the economic 
sectors on which the municipality depends, 
creates  pressure  that  must  be  addressed 
to open up new opportunities. The histori-
cal, cultural and environmental potential of 
Santiago de los Caballeros should be capi-
talized on to create a new sector, one that 
promotes Santiago de los Caballeros as a 
cultural tourism destination.

Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  has  six  im-
portant  markets:  the  area  of  Hospedaje 
Yaque,  La  Placita,  Mercado  Central,  El 
Modelo,  Pekín,  and  Matadero  Municipal. 
Not  including  Inespre  Markets  and  the 
markets  of  Cienfuegos  and  Yagüita  del 
Pastor,  the  remaining  are  operated  by 
City Hall. Despite the poor quality of their 
infrastructure,  these  markets  have  a  his-
tory of customs and traditions, and serve 
as distribution and purchasing centers for 
the whole region. This is a sector that con-
tinues to grow due to the boom in markets 
as tourist spots and thegastronomic tours

To build resilience, investments must be made in 
programs to reduce the underlying social conditions 
that burden and stress Santiago’s population. 

Yaque del 
Norte River

One of Santiago de los Caballeros’ challen-
ges is the lack of social cohesion. The fac-
tors leading to this lack of social cohesion, 
addressed through the third pillar, include 
high levels of violence (including domestic 
violence),  noise  pollution,  poor  quality  ni-
ghttime  public  lighting,  high  crime  levels, 
and  a  lack  of  a  sense  of  belonging  and 
identification with the city (ICES 2015). In 
addition,  there  is  an  inadequate  number 
of policies in place to address the needs of 
the most vulnerable sectors of society.

A top trigger of family violence and crimi-
nality  is  noise  (Voses,  2012).  In  Santiago 
de los Caballeros, noise pollution is consi-
dered to be high or very high (ICES 2015). 
Noise  contamination  directly  affects  the 
emotional and psychological health of resi-
dents creating a violent society that nega-
tively impacts families and the rest of the 
community” (Voses, 2012).

Crime levels and general feelings of inse-
curity  are  directly  related  to  the  lack  of 
sufficient  public  lighting  and  of  effective 
planning  and  administration  in  the  terri-
tory. Rapid economic development caused 

accelerated  industrialization  of  the  mu-
nicipality  without  properly  implemented 
public  policies  for  land  use  management. 
Therefore, zones of marginalized commu-
nities  were  created  and  expanded  while 
spaces for social cohesion, e.g., communi-
ty parks, were reduced. The city grew in a 
such an accelerated fashion that the terri-
tory’s capacity to adapt to new and increa-
sing population needs resulted in inequali-
ty and a host of unmet needs. Nearly 96% 
of the population reports that it would not 
dare to walk alone at night (ICES 2015)

One result of these factors is little access 
to  the  goods  and  services  that  are  indis-
pensable for living with dignity. Moreover, 
unemploy-ment  and  the  lack  of  regula-
tions in these areas have opened the doors 
to illegal activities, a situation that fosters 
the  criminality  that  shapes  the  popula-
tion’s perception of security and increases 
the levels of family violence.

Every  48  hours  a  woman  is  murdered 
by  her  partner  or  former  partner  in  the 
Do-minican Republic (Municipal Program 
of  Gender  Audit,  2011);  69.4%  percent 

of the women in Santiago de los Caballe-
ros  have  experienced  violence  at  some 
time in their lives (ICES, 2015). These data 
support the urgent need to invest in pro-
grams that improve citizen security, equity 
and  gender  equality  in  the  municipality. 
Such  programs  require  political  will  for 
their development and must have leaders-
hip that insists on gender equality, respect 
for human rights, support for democratic 
institutions, and a violence-free society.

One of the main challenges is the need to 
change the traditionally  chauvinistic cul-
ture  of  Santiago  society  and  to  improve 
the  quality  of  life  of  the  most  disadvan-
taged  sectors  of  the  population  by  pro-
viding  jobs,  housing  opportunities,  and 
access  to  basic  services.  This  requires  a 
new  link  between  civil  society  and  City 
Hall,  which  is  stated  by  the  Dominican 
Republic,  under  Decree  176-07,  regar-
ding participatory budgets. It also requi-
res  investing  in  educational  programs, 
in  social  services  for  those  who  live  in 
marginalized  and  violent  conditions,  and 
in  a  citizen  surveillance  system  that  em-
powers the city’s inhabitants.

CHALLENGES

This last pillar is a collection of actions to 
address the deterioration of public spaces 
that should provide areas for leisure and 
relaxation to the city’s inhabitants and help 
reduce social alienation and crime.

Rapid,  unplanned  development,  is  the  re-
sult  of  the  migration  of  people  from  rural 
areas  to  the  city.  Illegal  settlements  in  the 
most vulnerable areas of the city, along the 
gullies,  rivers,  and  streams,  have  impaired 
the  quality  of  these  water  bodies  and  the 
general  population’s  quality  of  life.  Espe-
cially  affected  are  the  people  who  live  in 
overcrowded  conditions  in  these  critical 
areas.  These  realities  are  impairing  the  ci-
ty’s green infrastructure and public spaces.

The  expansion  of  urban  sprawl  has  led  to 
uncontrolled settlement of areas adjacent to 
the city. This urban expansion37 has occurred 
at the same time as public spaces have been 
reduced38, and the result has been a serious 
impact on the public’s ability to access green 
areas. Green areas are also affected by the 
production  of  solid  and  liquid  waste,  which 
ends up obstructing the natural drainage in 
the city. The significant increase in the urban 
footprint was not offset by an increase in pu-
blic green spaces, which actually were redu-
ced by 20.5% while the percentage of private 
space increased.

This  disparity  has  meant  that  there  is  an 
unequal  distribution  of  public  green  and/ 
or  entertainment  areas  across  the  various 
urban  sectors  of  the  city.  It  is  important  to 
highlight  that  from  1960  to  2015,  the  ra-
tio  of  square  meters  of  recreational  areas 

per  inhabitant has been reduced 13 times 
in absolute terms. In 1960 the ratio was 58 
m2  of  recreation  space  per  inhabitant.  In 
2015, it was reduced to 4.5 m2 per inhabi-
tant, according to Santiago’s Strategic Plan. 
This means that not only the construction of 
green and recreational areas decreased, but 
that the existing spaces were insufficient and 
unequally  distributed  throughout  the  city. 
Today,  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  has  less 
than  2%  of  the  green  areas  per  inhabitant 
recommended by the World Health Organi-
zation. This means that the city lacks enough 
public spaces to foster social cohesion.

When contamination due to the discharge 
of  solid  waste  occurs  there  is  a  direct  co-
rrelation  with  the  amount  of  solid  waste 
produced, collected, and disposed of. In 17 
years Santiago de los Caballeros increased 
the production of solid waste tons and the 
municipal  government  kept  the  city  clea-
ning  costs  to  around  24  million  pesos  per 
month39.  This  cost  is  just  for  the  amount 
of waste produced in the city in the short 
term. It does not address the fact one sec-
tion  of  the  population  (generally  the  poo-
rest  and  most  vulnerable)  throws  away 
their solid waste in the city’s streams, rivers 
and gullies.

Regarding waste water discharges, the city 
must  address  the  sources  and  complete 

construction  of  waste  water  treatment 
plants  to  keep  the  levels  of  contaminants 
within allowed standards before they reach 
the region’s water bodies. However, althou-
gh  the  reduction  of  contamination  levels 
has not been fully achieved, some progress 
has been made.

Management  of  biomedical  waste40 
is 
another  important  issue  that  must  be  ad-
dressed. To date, while City Hall has been 
in charge of collecting biomedical waste at 
medical  centers  and  hospitals,  it  does  not 
have direct authority to do so. The lack of 
mechanisms  ensuring  collection,  manage-
ment, and final disposal of this highly con-
taminated  waste  negatively  impacts  the 
phytosanitary status of the city because of 
the exposure of the population to that was-
te. This lack also increases economic strains 
on the municipal budget based on the costs 
of  improper  management  of  biomedical 
waste, which, may not only cause contami-
nation  of  surface  water  and  groundwater, 
thus damaging the sources of potable wa-
ter,  but  may  also  cause  chronic  diseases 
that are not as trackable as infectious disea-
ses.  The  soil  water  and  air  contamination 
challenges  as  well  as  the  sanitation  issues 
faced  by  the  population  given  the  misma-
nagement  of  waste  can  unleash  diseases 
transmitted by such vectors as mosquitoes, 
rats, and mice.

37. The regional expansion of Santiago de los Caballeros has extended mainly to the east, south and northeast zones of the region where the most 
fertile soils are located.
38. In 1960 the public areas of the city occupied 36.5% (1.82 km2) of its total surface and the private space 63.5% (3.18 km2). Today this ratio is 
reduced by 16% (14.60 km2) for public space, with an increase of 84% (76.00 km2) for private space. During this period, the total surface of the city 
(“urban sprawl”) grew 18 times (85.60 km2), the total area of private space grew 24 times (72.82 km2) while the total area of public space barely 
grew 8 times (1.27 km2).
39. Data updated by the Solid Waste Comprehensive Management Direction and the Santiago City Hall Planning and Development Department 
as of 2018.
40. The municipal waste collection service processes only 90% of the daily waste produced in Santiago, which is 850 to 900 tons per day. To date, 
only 400 tons per day are being treated at the recycling plant built by Cilpen Global. The remaining waste goes directly to landfill sites because no 
pre-sorting program is in place.

This action creates legislation to govern the management of biomedical waste as well as a public bid 
process to receive tenders regarding the construction of a plant for the treatment of hospital waste. 
Under the decree, legislation must be passed to ensure that private companies with the capacity to 
offer solid waste collection service in an efficient manner are regulated and taxed by City Hall. Santia-
go City Hall may then concentrate on investing municipal resources in providing comprehensive ser-
vices for solid waste management and leave management of biomedical waste to the Regional Health 
Authority, as stated under the Health Law 42-01 of the Public Health Ministry. This strategy will help 
the city achieve a better quality of service and make the most of City Hall’s investment.

City Hall will launch a pilot on non-motorized sustainable mobility in the area around Yaque del Norte 
River to foster a renewal in this area and to motivate city residents to see this iconic public space as a 
symbol of Santiago’s recovery. Later, in a second stage, pilot activities will include identifying and prio-
ritizing the metropolitan areas best suited to adopting the bicycle mobility strategy, particularly those 
areas with a highly mobile school and university population.

In addition, the pilot will also involve the design of a training plan for city residents to explain the ad-
vantages of using bicycles for transportation.

And lastly, having demonstrated the need for areas where bicycles can be used for transportation and 
exercise, this action will foster budget planning for the design and construction of a cycling network 
in metropolitan areas with the greatest population. By 2020, a bicycle mobility strategy must be de-
fined and adopted that includes the introduction of a cycling infrastructure network, a public bicycle

NEXT  
STEPS

The  Resilience  Strategy  for  Santiago 
de  los  Caballeros  is  the  result  of  con-
solidating  the  human  and  technical 
capacities  of  the  municipality.  Thanks 
to  surveys  and  studies  conducted  by 
the  academic  sector,  NGOs,  and  the 
territory’s  governing  institutions.  The 
city has documents such as the Santia-
go  Strategic  Plan,  the  Basin  Plan,  and 
the  ICES-BID  Action  Plan,  as  well  as 
documents  stemming  from  academic 
research  projects,  that  reflect  a  clear 
desire to transform Santiago de los Ca-
balleros into a national and internatio-
nal example of the proper management 
of common assets and of sound princi-
ples for decision-making.

The  Chief  Resilience  Officer  will  work 
hand  in  hand  with  the  municipal  depart-
ments and their directors to support the 
application of a resilience lens in the plan-
ning and implementation of the initiatives 
described in this Resilience Strategy and 
in other initiatives that contribute to the 
city.  This  will  promote  adoption  of  the 
concept  of  resilience  as  an  overarching 
and  cross-functional  principle  of  munici-
pal management.

All  aspects  of  risk  management  will  be 
coordinated,  including  preventative  plan-
ning and response activities, early warning 
to and development of the response capa-
cities of vulnerable communities, and inte-
gration of human resources, as well as, ma-
terial and economic resources so that they 
are  sustainable  over  time.  To  accomplish 
this, the efforts of multiple stakeholders in 
the risk management of Santiago de los Ca-
balleros must take place as part of a coor-
dinated work plan. Communication among 
the  various  institutions  and  organizations 
that are part of the Resilience Committee 
for the territory’s management will be key.

Internationally, 100RC has partners who 
offer  pro  bono  services  to  cities  of  the 
network. They can assist the municipality 
in  implementing  its  resilience  initiatives. 
Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  must  capi-
talize  on  these  connections  along  with 
the other 99 100RC cities committed to 
building resilience and exchanging ideas, 
practices and knowledge.

The  project  “Vive  el  Yaque”  aims  to  reco-
ver Yaque del Norte River. It is coming at a 
time when there is a unique opportunity to 

transform  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros  and 
to bring the multiple benefits of resilience 
to  all  its  citizens.  The  city’s  dynamic  envi-
ronment  requires  a  monitoring  system  to 
play a key role in the periodic assessment of 
data that must take place as the Resilience 
Strategy is being implemented. The impact 
of  the  various  actions  to  build  resilience 
must be measured. For this strategy to be 
successful, all who work and live in the city 
must participate and every action must be 
monitored,  so  that    each  is  efficiently  and 
effectively executed for the benefit of every 
inhabitant of Santiago de los Caballeros.

Given  that  administrative  changes  are  a 
challenge, it is expected that this Resilien-
ce Strategy is just the beginning of the ci-
ty’s commitment to ensure the continua-
tion of the resilience program into future.

Santiago de los Caballeros will survive, adapt, 
and  grow  no  matter  what  types  of  acute 
shocks  and  chronic  stresses  it  undergoes, 
thanks to its commitment to moving forward 
as  a  unified  city  in  building  a  metropolitan 
territory  that  is  healthy  and  thriving  from 
following the path of resilience and sustaina-
bility. We invite you to walk this path with us.

C 

Climate Change
Change of weather, directly or indirectly attributable to human 
activity that alters the composition of the world’s atmosphere 
and that adds to the natural climate variability observed during 
comparable periods of time (UNFCCC).

Response Capacity 
The ability of people, organizations and systems to make use of 
available resources and technologies to face and manage adver-
se conditions, emergency situations and disasters (UNFCCC).

Social Capital
Networks with shared standards, values, and knowledge that fa-
cilitate cooperation within groups or among groups. According 
to  this  definition,  networks  are  understood  to  be  real-world 
links  among  groups  or    between  individuals  (e.g.,  networks  of 
friends,  family,  former  colleagues).  Social  capital  provides  the 
means  to  facilitate  collaboration,  cooperation,  and  innovation 
(OCDE).

Social Cohesion
Tendency of a group to be unified when working toward a goal 
or  when  addressing  the  emotional  needs  of  its  members  (Ca-
rron and Brawley, 2000). 

Coliform
The generic denomination coliform refers to a group of bacterial 
species with certain common biochemical features and a rele-
vant importance as indicators of water and food contamination.

Conurbation
An  area  that  is  not  administrative  nor  legal  and  that  does  not 
correspond with political-administrative boundaries. It consists 
of the adjacent urban areas of the city, contiguous with the Villa 
Gonzalez, Puñal, and Tamboril municipalities, as well as the mu-
nicipal district of San Francisco de Jacagua.

D 

Environmental Degradation
Reduction of the environment capacity to respond to needs and 
social and ecological objectives (UNISDR).

Human Development
It has the purpose of enhancing people’s opportunities, paying 
special  attention  to  the  value  of  human  lives  and  not  only  to 
wealth of economies (PNUD).

Sustainable Development
Development that meets the present needs without exposing 
the capacity of future generations to satisfy their own needs 
(Brundtland  Commission).  Sustainable  development  may 
not be achieved if there is no assurance that all women and 
men, and girls and boys, enjoy dignity and human rights and 
the chance to enhance their abilities, guarantee their repro-
ductive health and their rights, find decent employment and 
contribute to economic growth (UNFPA).

Disaster
A serious disruption in the function of a community or society 
that causes a large number of deaths as well as losses and ma-
terial, economic, and environmental impacts that exceed the ca-
pacity of the affected community or society to face the situation 
using its own resources.

Ecosystem Diversity
Ecosystem variations in a geographic location and their global im-
pact on human life and the environment.

Resilience Qualities
Qualities  that  enable  cities  to  withstand,  respond,  and  adapt 
more readily to acute shocks and chronic stresses (100RC).

Human Diversity
Variations based on physical characteristics and social context, 
that is, genes and culture (Durham, 1991)

E 

Eco-effective
Emulating nature in the process of directly maintaining the quali-
ty of resources through their life cycles instead of disposing of the 
waste produced. What is produced is not waste, but new resources.

Ecosystem
A  community  of  living  organisms  together  with  the  non-living 
components  of  their  environment  (e.g.,  air,  water,  or  mineral 
soil) that interact as one system. These biotic and abiotic com-
ponents are considered to be joined together throughout their 
life cycles and energy flows  (Odum, 1971).

Entrepreneurship
Process in which a person takes an idea and creates a concrete 
business,  for  a  profit  or  nonprofit,  which  results  in  innovation 
and employment opportunities.

Exposure
Populations,  properties,  systems  or  other  elements  present  in 
areas where there are threats and where, therefore, they may ex-
perience losses (UNISDR). 

F 

Geologic Fault
Discontinuity  in  a  rock  formation  through  which  a  significant 
displacement takes place when the rock mass moves. The ener-
gy released by the rapid movement in active faults is the cause of 
a majority of seismic movements (Allaby, 2015).

A

Adaptation to Climate Change
The adjustment of natural or human systems in response to cli-
mate stimuli or effects, actual or expected, that moderate their 
damage and exploit beneficial opportunities (UNFCCC). 

B 

Biodiversity
Range of life on Earth. It includes all bodies, species and popula-
tions, genetic variations among them and their complex sets of 
communities and ecosystems (UNEP).

L 

Greenhouse Gases
Atmospheric gases that are responsible for global warming and 
climate change. The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide 
(CO2),  methane  (CH4)  and  nitrous  oxide  (N2O).  Greenhouse 
gases that are less frequent, but very potent, are hydrofluoro-
carbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluori-
de (SF6) (UNFCCC).

Governability
The capacity of a socio-political system to govern itself, which in 
turn depends on the quality of the system’s laws and regulations 
as well as the system’s influence on them. The greater the qua-
lity of the governance, the greater the institutional capacity to 
meet the system’s needs.

Governance
Term used to refer to the efficacy, quality, and good leadership 
features of the interaction between strategic actors of a terri-
tory in responding to its society’s needs.

I 

Shock
Sudden  natural  and  social  disasters  such  as  fires,  earthquakes, 
floods, and acts of terrorism.

Isoacceleration
A  fixed  rhythm  of  acceleration/deceleration  from  a  seismic 
fault. The amplitude distribution of maximum accelerations in 
soil is present in curves calculated by interpolation of accelera-
tion/deceleration values.

154

Liquefaction
Liquefaction of soils is a phenomenon in which land, specifically 
recent sediments, such as sand and gravel, lose their firmness 
and flow due to water saturation, and as a result of the stress 
caused upon them by earthquakes. Liquefaction is a major cau-
se of earthquake-related destruction (even more so than the 
direct  action  of  waves  on  buildings).  That  is,  liquefaction  can 
displace,  sink,  or  topple  infrastructure,  including    homes  and 
other buildings.

M 

Mitigation for Climate Change
Human  interventions  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  sources  or  to 
increase  sumps  for  greenhouse  gases.  Interventions  to  reduce 
greenhouse gases includes the use of fossil fuels in a more efficient 
manner and the use of solar power or wind power. “Sumps” are fo-
rests or oceans that are healthy enough to absorb and eliminate 
large amounts of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (UNFCCC).

P 

Citizen Involvement
Individual and collective actions designed to identify and address 
that relate to the public interest. It is a collective commitment to 
work on making a difference in the civic life of a community and 
to develop the knowledge, skills, values and goals to achieve it. It 
means to foster quality of life through both political and non-poli-
tical processes (New York Times).

R 

T 

Resilience
The  capacity  of  individuals,  communities,  businesses  and  sys-
tems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow, no matter what 
kinds  of  acute  shocks  and  chronic  stresses  they  experience. 
(100RC - Rockefeller Foundation).

Stress
Factors  that  create  periodic  pressure  on  a  city,  such  as  food 
shortages,  drought,  overloaded  transportation  infrastructure, 
gender violence, and high unemployment rates.

Risk
The combination of probability that an event will occur and its 
negative consequences (UNISDR). 

V 

S 

Ecosystemic Services
The benefits obtained from ecosystems by people and communi-
ties. Among the benefits that ecosystems offer are the so-called 
“regulating services,” such as regulation of floods, droughts, and 
soil  degradation,  and  the  “provision  services,”  such  as  food  and 
water. Also included are “support services,” such as soil formation 
and nutrient cycles, and “cultural services,” such as recreational, 
spiritual, religious, and other non-material services (UNISDR).

Early Alert System
The set of capacities needed to produce and broadcast alert  in-
formation that is critical and timely so that individuals, commu-
nities, and organizations endangered by a threat can get ready 
to  act  appropriately  and  with  enough  lead  time  to  reduce  the 
possibility of losses or damages (UNISDR).

Sustainability
Derived from “sustainment” and “ability,” this concept refers to 
the  property  of  biological  systems  to  remain  diverse  and  pro-
ductive  over  time.  In  more  general  terms,  sustainability  is  the 
permanence of systems and processes. The governing principle 
of sustainability is sustainable development, which includes four 
interconnected domains: ecology, economy, politics, and culture 
(James et al., 2015).

Vulnerability
The features and circumstances of a community or system that 
makes it subject to the harmful effects of a threat (UNISDR).

Physical Vulnerability
Elements  that  can  potentially  be  exposed  to  acute  shocks  re-
quire an assessment of their physical vulnerability, that is,  their 
predisposition to suffer damages (Douglas, 2007).

Social Vulnerability
A  pre-existing  condition  affecting  the  capacity  of  a  society  to 
prepare for and to recover from a disruptive event.

Man-made Vulnerability
The reduced capacity of a person or group of people to antici-
pate, face, and resist the effects of a natural threat or one cau-
sed by human activity, and to recover from those threats. It is 
a  relative  and  dynamic  concept.  Vulnerability  is  almost  always 
associated with poverty. However, people living in isolation and 
with insecurity and feelings of helplessness in the face of risks, 
shocks, or chronic stresses are also vulnerable.

Natural Vulnerability
A complex internal factor of risk in a system that corresponds to 
the degree of exposure to harm when there is a specific threat, 
natural or man-made, given the system’s intrinsic disposition to 
be harmed. This type of vulnerability can be expressed through 
various  dimensions:  physical,  cultural,  psychosocial,  environ-
mental, economic, political, and institutional
