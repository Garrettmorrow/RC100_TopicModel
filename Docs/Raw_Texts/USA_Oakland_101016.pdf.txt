About 100 
Resilient Cities

Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, 
100 Resilient Cities (100RC) is dedicated to 
helping cities around the world become more 
resilient to the physical, social, and economic 
challenges that are a growing part of the 
21st century. 100RC supports the adoption 
and incorporation of a view of resilience that 
includes not just the shocks—earthquakes, 
fires, floods, etc.—but also the stresses that 
weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or 
cyclical basis. By addressing both the shocks 
and the stresses, a city becomes more able 
to respond to adverse events, and overall, 
is better able to deliver basic functions in 
both good times and bad, to all populations. 
Oakland was accepted into the first wave 
of cities in the 100RC network, alongside 
Berkeley and San Francisco in the Bay Area. 
The three cities, led by their respective Chief 
Resilience Officers, have been collaborating 
to leverage regional efficiencies for their 
strategy development processes, where 
possible, and will continue to collaborate on 
implementing their resilience strategies.

The Fox Theater originally opened its doors in 
1928 as an elaborate movie palace, and serves as 
a symbol of resilience. It shuttered in 1966 and 
remained closed for 40 years, surviving a fire 
and an earthquake, and escaping the wrecking 
ball before being restored to its former splendor, 
reopening in 2009 as part of the renewal of the 
Uptown theater and arts district.

to support our promising future.  

October 10, 2016

has shaped Resilient Oakland. 

We know today’s greatest challenges, 
such as rising income inequality, 
which impacts our most vulnerable 
communities, cannot be solved by 
one of our agencies, organizations 
or communities alone. This Resilient 
Oakland playbook centers on 
increasing collaboration inside our City 
government through the launch of our 
new Civic Design Lab, building new 
and innovative partnerships among 
regional governments and co-designing 
community engagement processes with 
those who live and work in Oakland.

A resilient Oakland manifests through 
robust community organizations, 
engaged residents and a City 
government opening itself up to 
the idea that change is inevitable 
—we must now harness it for the 
benefit of our growing town.

Sincerely,

Libby Schaaf,  
Mayor of Oakland

Oakland has a rich tradition of social 
innovation and a strong legacy of 
resilience. Resilience in Oakland means 
tackling systemic, interdependent 
challenges, such as equitable 
access to quality education and 
jobs, housing security, community 
safety and vibrant infrastructure to 
better prepare us for shocks like 
earthquakes and stresses like climate 
change. To achieve this, we need to 
leverage our collective resources 
by fostering a culture of responsive 
and trustworthy government, data-
driven decisions centered around 
residents' needs and robust, smart 
infrastructure development.

Oakland has the physical and human 
resources to be a thriving and 
connected 21st century global city. 
As the birthplace of the women’s 
suffrage movement and the Black 
Panther Party, Oakland has long been 
an innovative, mission-driven city 
committed to economic and social 
justice and equitable growth. Our town 
attracts renowned activists, artists, 
makers, and other risk-takers within 
its 78 square miles addressing the 
serious issues of our day. Oakland’s 
current resilience challenges are an 
opportunity to do what Oakland has 
always done: rethink old paradigms 
and balance the equation of access 
to opportunity while building more 
creative and vibrant infrastructure

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient 
Cities team, I want to congratulate 
the City of Oakland on the release 
of Resilient Oakland. This bold 
strategy will drive innovation 
in City government, promote 
economic security for residents and 
strengthen Oakland’s neighborhoods 
and physical infrastructure.

Recognizing that Oakland is best 
positioned to thrive when residents, 
community organizations, local 
businesses and government come 
together, this strategy represents 
a call to action for all Oaklanders. 
Resilient Oakland outlines concrete 
actions that will address current 
and future shocks and stresses, 
ranging from economic inequality 
to insufficient affordable housing 
to sea level rise to earthquakes—
reflecting the holistic urban resilience 
approach that 100RC seeks to 
spread throughout our network of 
100 member cities and beyond. 

Mayor Libby Schaaf’s leadership 
and support were critical in the 
development of this strategy, and I 
want to thank her for her partnership 
and commitment. I also want to thank 
Oakland’s Chief Resilience Officer, 
Kiran Jain, for her tireless dedication 
and for the innovative vision that 

While the release of this document 
marks an important milestone, our 
work is far from over. It will take 
continued commitment and action 
to ensure that this strategy has an 
impact. This is why we are excited to 
continue our partnership as Oakland 
embarks upon implementation—the 
work of making the actions described 
in this strategy a reality. Actions such 
as improving affordable housing 
access by redesigning the City’s 
Rent Adjustment Program website; 
retrofitting homes so they produce 
their own energy and conserve water 
through the EcoBlock pilot; and 
preparing vulnerable communities 
more effectively for disasters through 
“Neighbors Helping Neighbors” are 
just some of the initiatives that will 
lead to a more secure and vibrant 
future for Oakland residents.

These and other initiatives are making 
Oakland a leader in the urban resilience 
movement—and we anticipate that 
many will become best practices 
that other cities within the 100RC 
Network will emulate. We are thrilled 
to recognize and celebrate Oakland’s 
achievement in releasing Resilient 
Oakland, and look forward to our 
continued partnership as Oakland helps 
to spread urban resilience to cities 
across the United States and the world.  

Sincerely, 

Michael Berkowitz 
President, 100 Resilient Cities

progressive urban coastal cities in the United States. 
As a major city in the Bay Area, Oakland also sits 
within one of the most prosperous economic growth 
engines in the world. The benefits of this growth, as 
acutely felt in Oakland, are not equitably distributed. 
Today, particularly among low-income neighborhoods 
and communities of color, Oakland faces rapidly 
rising income inequality and housing displacement, 
disparate unemployment and education rates, and 
chronic violence. A person living just one mile from 
a fellow Oaklander may be nearly twice as likely to 
be unemployed, and live 15 years less. Aging housing 
stock and public infrastructure challenged by seismic 
and climate risk further threaten Oakland residents, 
particularly our most vulnerable communities. 

 

In this time of hyper-prosperity brought on, in part, by the technology and real 
estate booms in the San Francisco Bay Area, Oakland is uniquely positioned to 
take advantage of its growth while remaining true to its roots and sense of self. 
Resilient Oakland embraces Oakland’s strengths while tackling the daily and 
chronic stresses facing Oaklanders today and better preparing for  
tomorrow’s challenges.  

Though comprehensive in scope, Resilient Oakland is not a finished product or 
a plan in the traditional sense. Rather, this playbook is a call to action. Resilient 
Oakland sets forth the work we need to do to begin modernizing our City 
by integrating processes, policies and programs that achieve greater impact. 
Resilient Oakland illuminates what is possible, whether it is breaking down 
workforce data by demographic population to better address the needs of our 
underserved residents or inviting our Human Services, Housing & Community 
Development, and Economic & Workforce Development departments to work 
together on leveraging economic and housing security strategies. Through this 
work, we are changing the way we do government. And in the process, we are 
making our institutions—both local and regional—more resilient and responsive to 
whatever may come our way.

We begin with a timeline highlighting a century of resilience in Oakland followed 
by a history of resilient actions the City has taken over the last 20 years to 
further social, economic and physical development. We then outline 15 major 
resilience challenges facing our town, which are then addressed by three key 
themes and 10 main goals accomplished through nearly 40 resilient actions.

of strategies and actions to tackle systemic, 
interdependent challenges. This includes equitable 
access to quality education and jobs, housing 
security, community safety and vibrant infrastructure, 
which will better prepare us for shocks like 
earthquakes and climate change impacts.

Under the leadership of our Chief Resilience Officer, Kiran Jain, the Resilient 
Oakland playbook is designed to set forth strategies that will deliver more 
effective governance and ways to solve complex multi-stakeholder challenges. 
Resilient Oakland recognizes government simply cannot spend its way out 
of challenges, such as housing displacement or climate adaptation. We need 
to approach our work differently and rethink how we maximize resources to 
benefit our residents and businesses. By taking a continuous build, measure, 
learn approach to resiliency from ‘little bets’1 to ‘moonshots’2, we honor 
the work that has been done and how we build on it today while setting 
forth bold actions that accelerate our ability to meet these challenges.  

The three key themes for advancing resilience in Oakland are: (1) build a more 
trustworthy and responsive government, (2) stay rooted and thrive in our town, 
and (3) build a more vibrant and connected Oakland. Some of the actions 
outlined under these three key themes were already underway (such the Mayor’s 
Community Safety Plan) and are included here due to their clear resilience value, 
some have been adapted with a resilience lens in mind, some have been fast 
tracked due to the resources available through the 100 Resilient Cities program 
(such as digital improvements to the Rent Adjustment Program, the City’s green 
infrastructure plan or sea level rise roadmap), and others have come about as a 
result of stakeholder engagement through Resilient Oakland’s two-year process. 

The Resilient Oakland playbook celebrates a City government opening itself up to 
the idea that change is inevitable—we must now harness it for the benefit of our 
growing town.

These icons represent the main shocks and stresses facing Oakland, 
identified as part of the Preliminary Resilience Assessment. Each one is 
described more in the following pages. The effects of the shocks such 
as earthquakes or wildfires are often exacerbated by long-term stresses, 
such as wealth disparities and limited city resources. The dashed lines 
represent these interconnections between the shocks and stresses.

Equity is critical to Oakland’s resilience. According 
to a recent report by the Public Policy Institute of 
California, the State’s per capita gross domestic 
product has increased by more than 30 percent 
since 1997. Over this same period, top incomes 
have grown at more than double the rate of low 
and middle incomes. These trends seem contrary 
to the idea that “a rising tide lifts all boats.”3 This 
statewide occurrence is acutely felt in Oakland 
where a tale of two cities, one of hyper-prosperity 
and the other of deep poverty, informs how 
resilience challenges are addressed and tackled. 

Many Oaklanders experience chronic social stresses like poverty, unemployment, 
and violence. Wide disparities exist in employment and wages, educational 
attainment, and health outcomes. These social stresses are correlated with a 
greater vulnerability to physical shocks: low-income households in Oakland 
are more likely to be located in areas at greater risk of sea level rise, seismic 
instability, and liquefaction. These chronic stresses compound the risks of 
intermittent shocks, leaving our communities that already experience inequity 
further exposed to risk, which further weakens our resilience as a city.

Stresses
Socioeconomic Disparities—A Tale of Two Cities
From 2015 to 2016, Oakland's rental housing market saw a 15 percent increase 
in median rents, which is more than 5 times the national rate of increase.4 In the 
same time period, Oakland's office rents increased 35 percent, making it the 
world's fastest-growing office rental market.5 But economic growth has been 
unequal across the city. Technology workers are finding Oakland an increasingly 
attractive place in which to live and do business. Yet, this influx of wealth is 
placing stress on many existing residents and less-skilled workers at a time when 
the manufacturing industry that was once a mainstay of the Oakland economy is 
shrinking. Consequently, Oakland’s current story is a tale of two cities. The first 
city is a more global Oakland, rebounded from a deep recession where citywide 
statistics are improving each year. The second city is the one seen by low-income 
neighborhoods and communities of color, where the effects of these improving 
statistics have yet to be seen and the recovery has been painstakingly slow.

Educational Disparities
Oakland exceeds national levels both for the number of adults with college and 
post-graduate degrees and for the number of adults who did not complete 
high school. In the past decade, Oakland’s public schools have made important 
gains in student achievement. Today, the Oakland Unified School District 
stands as California’s most-improved urban school district.9 However, only 
a minority of Oakland’s children are meeting key educational milestones. 

On most metrics, the achievement gap persists when comparing African 
American and Latino students to White and Asian students. A majority of 
Oakland’s public schools struggle to serve students, particularly students 
of color and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged or language 
minority backgrounds. Although Oakland’s graduation rate has improved 
in recent years to 63 percent, it still lags behind the average graduation 
rate of 80 percent for Alameda County and California.10 Too many Oakland 
students are not gaining the skills needed for successful employment.

Access to Good Jobs
Since the Great Recession, Oakland has seen unemployment decrease 
consistently. After reaching a ten-year high of 16.9 percent for 2010, Oakland’s 
currently unemployment rate has dropped to 6.0 percent. While Oakland’s 
unemployment rate has decreased during this period, it remains higher than 
current the National (4.9 percent), State (5.9 percent), and Alameda County (4.8 
percent) averages.11 It is important to note that these statistics fail to capture 
people who are disconnected from the local economy and who have stopped 
searching for jobs.

Between July 2015 and July 2016, 29,500 new jobs were added in the 
East Bay. But, this job growth has not impacted all communities equally.

rate among communities of color during this period is in stark contrast to an 
unemployment rate of five percent among Whites during the same period.

While the current economic conditions in Oakland have improved since 2014, 
these racial disparities still persist. Increasing access to good jobs means also 
making sure access is equitable. 

High Crime Rate
Between 2013 and 2015 Oakland had on average 84 murders per year. Although 
more of the shootings that occurred in 2015 were fatal, 2015 marks the third 
consecutive year of double-digit reductions in shootings in Oakland.14 To put this 
3-year trend into perspective, nearly 250 fewer Oakland residents were injured 
or killed by gun violence in 2015 than in 2012, and over 1,100 fewer people were 
victims of violent crime in 2015 than in 2012.15 Despite progress, Oakland exceeds 
statewide and national trends for violent crime. Gun violence is of particular

concern, with 341 reports of aggravated assaults with a firearm in 2015. Serious 
violence is most concentrated among individuals (mostly young men) 18 to 34 
years old, and the highest percentage of victims and suspects are men between 
the ages of 18 and 24, followed by men between the ages of 25 and 34. 

Violence is disproportionately concentrated in specific parts of the city, 
particularly in East and West Oakland. According to law enforcement data, 
the individuals engaged in a majority of the robberies throughout the city 
are the same as those engaged in violent crime in East and West Oakland. 
This geographic distribution correlates closely with the concentration of 
stressors that can increase the risk of violence like rates of arrest, crime 
incidence, food stamp participation rates, youth incarceration and probation 
rates, rates of violent suspensions, and chronic student absences.16

Insufficient Affordable Housing
Oakland is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis. Between 2012 and 2015, 
median market rate rental prices citywide increased substantially while the 
supply of housing decreased. The biggest changes occurred in rental rates for 
two-bedroom apartments, where market rate rents increased by 111 percent 
citywide while supply fell by 59 percent during this period. The second largest 
change in this period occurred in rental rates for one-bedroom apartments, 
where the rent increased by 76 percent while supply decreased by 13 percent.17 
Increases in market rate rental prices at this scale mean that residents will 
be forced to pay a larger percentage of their household income on rent.18

apartments fell by

renters in Oakland grew by an average of 1,035 homes per year from the

are over 26,000 severely cost-burdened, low-income renters and nearly 
9,000 severely cost-burdened, low-income owners in Oakland—renters or 
owners paying over 50 percent of their household income on rent. 

Furthermore, this housing crisis is disproportionately impacting 
low-income community and communities of color. African Americans 
represent 35 percent—17,125 households—of  homeowners that are 
severely cost burdened. For renters, African Americans comprise 45 
percent—11,645 households—of severely rent-burdened households.

Chronic Homelessness
Chronic homelessness is most commonly defined as a person 
experiencing homelessness for more than a year, or an unaccom-
panied individual with a disabling condition who has had at least 
four episodes of homelessness in the past three years.

...African Americans  

represent 

54% 

of the individuals  

experiencing  
homelessness

Every two years Alameda County conducts a Point In Time Count (PITC) of 
persons experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. According to the 
2015 PITC, there were an estimated 4,040 individuals experiencing homelessness 
in Alameda County.20 While only 13 percent of Alameda County’s population is Af-
rican American, African Americans represent 54 percent of the individuals expe-
riencing homelessness. According to the City's Department of Human Services, in 
the last PITC, on any given night in Oakland, there are 2,191 homeless people, and 
63 percent of them (1,384) are unsheltered—living on the streets or in places not 
meant for habitation. While data is limited, that number appears to be growing 
as housing prices rise and traditional housing for very low income residents such 
as single-room occupancy hotels are being converted to other purposes. 

Oakland provides resources for rapid re-housing, including rent subsidies, 
case management, and services to address root causes of homelessness. 
However, the supply and access to affordable housing is severely limited. 
The City collaborates closely with housing and service providers as well 
as mainstream agencies in Alameda County and the Oakland Housing 
Authority on issues related to chronic homelessness, including winter-relief 
shelter efforts and housing subsidy programs for interim and permanent 
supportive housing. In order to provide adequate shelter for all residents, 
both appropriate locations and funding for additional winter shelter 
beds for the more difficult, colder months of the year are needed.

Trust in Government
While many American cities have seen a drop in crime this past decade, trust in 
local law enforcement is at the center of a national debate. Recent police mis-
conduct in the Oakland Police Department and high crime rates have diminished 
trust in local police. As a result, the City government has tackled these issues 
by expanding its engagement efforts in recruiting a new police chief, releasing 
public safety data, and partnering with institutions like Stanford University to 
study and mitigate racial profiling. The City’s holistic approach to community 
safety focuses on helping families thrive, neighborhoods becoming safer, and 
communities healing from trauma and restoring their trust in the police.

Additionally, ethical conduct among City staff and officials continues to be 
an important issue among the community. Residents at public meetings, the 
press, and a few public institutions have expressed concern around govern-
ment transparency, including City compliance with open meeting policies or 
public records laws. In 2013, the Alameda County Grand Jury identified 29 
instances in which City Council members interfered with the administrative 
functions of the City.21 In November 2014, the residents of Oakland voted to 
amend the City Charter in favor of increasing the Public Ethics Commission’s 
strength, independence, and staffing. The City Council also approved the 
Government Ethics Act in December 2014 to provide a clear, comprehen-
sive, and enforceable framework of ethics rules in Oakland.

Limited City Resources
Despite prudent and conservative fiscal policies established since the last 
economic downturn and robust economic growth, over the long term, with-
out intervention, the City’s expenditures are projected to grow faster than 
revenues. The growth rate in revenues from taxes and fees is slower than 
the growth rate of personnel, utility, fuel, and other costs. Simultaneously, 
the City will require significant new investments in capital and services to 
maintain current infrastructure and quality of life. These trends, when coupled 
with limitations on the ability of local governments in California to generate 
new sources of revenue, create continual pressure to reduce government 
services or continue deferring capital investments. In times of economic 
downturn, these limitations can lead to dramatic reductions in government 
services at precisely the times those services are most needed by residents.

Droughts
California has historically experienced cyclical periods of extreme drought, 
including the present period which has lasted four years and is ongoing. 
These droughts lead to significant mandatory conservation requirements. 
A changing climate is expected to bring deeper, longer droughts and more 
days of extreme heat. During a drought, Oakland experiences higher water 
prices, decreased cooling options during extreme-heat days, loss of shade 
trees and plants and open space values, and higher risk of wildfires.27 Extreme 
heat disproportionately affects the health of vulnerable populations.

Sea Level Rise

Oakland is  

expected to experience 

12–24 

inches of sea level 

rise by 2050

Oakland is  

expected to experience 

36–66 

inches of sea level 

As the elevation of San Francisco Bay rises in response to warming oceans and 
melting ice sheets, coastal floods will only increase in frequency and severity.
Low-lying coastal residential areas, the Port of Oakland, the former Oakland 
Army Base, and a variety of low-lying areas near the Coliseum, Oakland Interna-
tional Airport, and Interstate 880 are most at risk. According to the Bay Conser-
vation and Development Commission, Oakland is expected to experience 12 to 
24 inches of sea level rise by 2050 and 36 to 66 inches of sea level rise by the 
year 2100.23 Adapting to Rising Tides (ART) is a regional program addressing sea 
level rise risk in the San Francisco Bay Area. Within Oakland, the ART Subregional 

Pilot Project estimated that 6,000 of Oakland’s residents would be at risk from 
16 inches of sea level rise, with 9,000 at risk from 55 inches of related flooding.24

Sea level rise will not impact all Oakland residents in the same way, as 
some are more vulnerable than others. Some communities lack access 
to preparedness information, transportation options, healthcare, and 
insurance, which increase their vulnerability to the adverse impacts of a 
flood event. Communities of color and low-income communities are over 
represented in the most vulnerable segments of the population.25 

Adaptation to sea level rise may also impact Oakland residents in different 
ways. Adapting will require significant public investment. Without proactive 
consideration of environmental justice concerns, adaptation decisions 
about what is protected and how it is paid for may have a disproportionate 
impact on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.25

Shocks

Many of the acute shocks facing Oakland are well known. Earthquakes and 
wildfires have severely damaged the City in the past. The effects of such shocks 
are exacerbated by long-term social stresses, such as violent crime and econom-
ic, health, and educational disparities outlined previously. Now, climate change 
threatens the City, with impacts that are felt as both discrete shocks (coastal 
floods and increased wildfire risks) and continual or periodic stresses (rising seas 
and droughts). As the climate warms, droughts, extreme-heat days, and large 
rain storms are expected to occur more frequently and with greater intensity. 
Oakland’s vulnerable residents, including the elderly, children, and communities 
of color, may be at a disproportionate disadvantage to these increasing threats.

External Economic Crises
The City of Oakland is part of the San Francisco Bay Area regional economy, 
which, like most local economies in the U.S., is prone to occasional reces-
sions and contractions. The regional economy is particularly dependent 
on the technology and real estate sectors, which are prone to particularly 
dramatic boom-bust cycles. Given large income disparities and the City’s 
revenue structure, these economic crises have a tendency to impact the most 
vulnerable residents while simultaneously reducing City resources to serve 
those residents. The City and region are also vulnerable to shocks related 
to international trade, travel, tourism, logistics, and manufacturing. Analysis 
from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that national eco-
nomic contractions recur on approximately 7-year cycles.32 During the prior 
economic recession, the City’s discretionary revenues were reduced by nearly 
12 percent, while the demands for City services dramatically increased.

In Northern California, seven major fault systems are considered capable of 
rupturing in earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 or larger.26 The Hayward Fault, located 
at the base of the hills on the eastern edge of the City, has a 31 percent chance 
of producing such an earthquake within the next 30 years. An earthquake of 
this magnitude would cause significant damage in Oakland; shaking from the 
Hayward fault could be 3 to 10 times stronger than the shaking experienced in 
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Soft-story apartment buildings are particularly 
at risk; there are more than 22,000 apartment units in soft-story buildings in 
Oakland.27 Earthquakes also cause liquefaction, a phenomenon in which soil 
loses its strength, stiffness, and ability to support buildings. The U.S. Geological 
Survey has mapped the likelihood of liquefaction of soils in Oakland in the event 
of a major earthquake along the Hayward Fault.28 The flat-land areas of Oakland 
are at the highest risk, and these areas overlap with the locations of much of the 
critical transportation infrastructure and emergency operations facilities for the 
City. These areas are also home to many low-income and vulnerable residents.

Coastal (Bay) and Urban Floods
The intensity and frequency of precipitation events are expected to increase 
due to climate change.29 The combination of higher tides due to sea level rise 
and larger storms with Oakland’s aging stormwater drainage systems may lead 
to significant increases in both coastal and urban flooding and flood damage. 
Low-lying areas, such as the Coliseum and West Oakland neighborhood, are 
particularly vulnerable to coastal (Bay) and urban floods.30 In December 2014, a 
combination of coastal and urban flooding closed roads, businesses, and schools 
throughout the City, impacting public safety, education, and Oakland’s economy.

Wildfires
The Oakland Hills Firestorm of 1991 was the most destructive fire in State history.31 
Although wildfires may occur at any time of year and in any climate, the risk of 
fire increases greatly with increased drought and heat. California’s future climate 
of frequent drought and higher heat leaves Oakland at extreme risk for wildfires.

What I’ve Learned  
Since Finding My Voice

By Azariah Cole-Shephard
Ms. Cole-Shephard is 18 years old and attends  
Charles W. Davidson College of Engineering at San José State University,  
where she majors in Electrical Engineering. She is a 2016  
graduate of Lionel Wilson Preparatory Academy.

All lives didn’t matter to you before black lives mattered to us. 
Let’s think back to why rosa sat on that bus 
Why when we are in stores racism follows us 
Why tamir was shot faster than the pen crossed the first T on the trust 
Why sandra bland was my friend and I didn’t even know her.
Why she was already dead and y'all didn't even have to shoot her.
Why her name goes unuttered when you claim you spitting truth. 
Don’t know why y’all refuse to invest in the futures of the youth beyond the school to prison
pipeline and our successes don’t fit your timeline but we still thrive

You see I will never be ready for the lynching that awaits me. 
The day I say the revolution is now,
they will realize that we are coming
and there is no way out and they will kill me. 
But this time not emotionally 
no this time physically 
but the one thing they can’t touch is my spirituality
because the reality of it all is that…
Lynching won’t kill my soul
even if it does snatch my last breath 
and crush my vocal chords. 

The legacy of the ancestors breathes through me 
and I put their strength upon my back 
Lifting one griot at a time
so I can remain steady...
in my work to liberate my people 
and to deconstruct the noose
I am breaking down this institution,

but what will you do?

The student researchers used an interview-based approach and  
conducted 13 condensed and 6 in-depth interviews with community leaders,

distributed an online survey. These methods demonstrated the need for a 
human-scale approach to resilience and led to insights on personal resilience 
and the different ways Oakland residents understand and experience resilience 
in their lives.  
The following pages illustrate some of the key findings from the 2016 [In]City

City work differently to better serve Oakland 
residents and businesses, while maximizing the 
benefits we provide them. To do so, we need 
to shift old paradigms and adopt new ways 
of doing the business of government. 

The City of Oakland will focus on modernizing City processes by growing 
and supporting a culture of civic innovation built on data analysis, iterative 
processes, and human-centered service design. These methodologies 
ensure City programs and policies are designed around the needs and 
aspirations of Oakland residents, and are continuously optimized. Better 
data collection and analysis will foster improved evidence-based decision 
making. Human-centered, iterative design will help break down government 
silos, ensure that services are understandable and easy to use, and promote 
continuous process refinement to serve Oaklanders more effectively.

“We believe that success will come from the freedom to try new 
things in a culture that is not guided by apprehension, but rather 
allows us to pursue new opportunities and partnerships in nimble, 
flexible ways. Our work must be multidisciplinary and multilevel, 
engaging all facets of our organization working across agencies. 
We must accept and harness changes that are inevitable. We 
will use change as an opportunity to creatively adapt and better 
serve all residents. We will be responsive to the community and 
engage in two-way dialogue, which includes setting honest 
expectations and following through on commitments.”

To achieve a more trustworthy and responsive government, we also need to 
empower our “entrepreneurial bureaucrats” to think outside the box while 
collaborating closely with community stakeholders. The City of Oakland 
boasts a passionate and mission-driven staff.  Resilient Oakland engaged 
staff from nearly all City departments, led by a team of doers and innovators, 
to address interdisciplinary issues. To deepen resilience in their own work, 
City staff developed the following guiding principles during this process:

These principles provide a framework to move the City forward faster, in a more 
collaborative way, so we can tackle our resilience challenges quickly and more 
effectively.

community in the decision-making 
process, and establish applicable 
frameworks for discrete issues that 
can be iterated and replicated.

The four-workshop series is being 
co-designed and co-led by City 
staff and community partners, 
to focus on the following: 

Workshop 1: Create a collective 
understanding of successful and 
unsuccessful engagement methods

Workshop 2: Understand common 
themes and create engagement  
principles

Workshop 3: Co-design an engagement 
strategy around an upcoming  
City project 

Workshop 4: Evaluate and iterate 
the engagement strategy

The City of Oakland seeks to shift 
from a traditional, top-down “input 
and feedback” model of community 
engagement to a collaborative, 
problem-solving process through 
which residents are partners in making 
policy and implementing programs 
that address their needs. Applying 
community-identified principles of 
engagement and collaborative problem 
solving will cultivate trust among 
and between community and City 
staff. The principles can be applied to 
future offline and online engagement 
efforts, improve the relevance and 
effectiveness of City policies, and 
enable more responsive government.

Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Expands and deepens community 

engagement—already underway 
in various efforts throughout 
the City of Oakland—in terms of 
resiliency, climate action, land use, 
transportation, economic devel-
opment, housing, public spaces, 
cultural arts, and social equity.
 ` Supports workshops/trainings 

that help develop a framework for 
equitable engagement among City 
staff and equitable action plans 
between the City and the community. 

 ` Builds civic capacity by using both 

digital and in-person community 
engagement tools, such as surveys 
or participatory budgeting.

Ultimately, the goal is to better 
answer the question: How can we 
most smoothly create a positive 
feedback loop between community 
input and service delivery, particularly 
in communities that are traditionally 
less engaged than others?

DEVELOP PRINCIPLES FOR COMMUNITY 
ENGAGEMENT IN OAKLAND

Description
The City of Oakland in partnership 
with Rebuild by Design, West Oakland 
Environmental Indicators Project, 
and Streetwyze is developing new 
principles for community engagement 
to identify and address the needs of 
residents and communities. These 
principles are being developed through 
a collaborative process with City staff 
and community leaders in a series of 
workshops that examine the range of 
engagement strategies used, evaluate 

their effectiveness and limitations, 
and incorporate community-relevant 
metrics and benchmarks to measure 
the outcomes of community outreach 
and engagement tools and practices. 

These workshops are being developed 
using a co-designed engagement 
process that will give the City the tools 
and relationships it needs to conduct 
better outreach, lead to an improved 
understanding of how the City can 
conduct more effective engagement

Description
The City of Oakland is a member of the  
Urban Sustainability Directors’ Network, 
which supports local sustainability and 
resilience efforts through networking, 
training, information sharing, and fund-
ing. The Partners for Places Equity Pilot 
grant (P4P-E) is a competitive funding 
opportunity designed to bolster 
collaboration between municipal sus-
tainability staff and community leaders, 
and to increase equity throughout 
communities. The City and its com-

are of utmost importance to many 
communities in Oakland: those most 
exposed to pollution from vehicular 
traffic or industrial waste, those 
paying a higher portion of their 
wages for electricity and gas, those 
in need of stable jobs, and many 
other disadvantaged communities.

Description
The City will explore working with 
the Equality Indicators Project (EIP) 
to develop a framework to promote 
equitable outcomes for Oakland resi-
dents.  This framework could include 
collecting key metrics that can be used 
to track progress in improving out-
comes for Oakland’s most vulnerable 
residents.  These metrics could include 
data across priority domains, such as 
Economy, Education, Health, Housing, 
Justice, and Services. EIP could then 
help the City establish baseline metrics 
and track changes annually. The City 
would be able to use data to under-
stand which policies and programs are 
most effective in improving outcomes 
for disadvantaged Oakland residents 
and should therefore be expanded, and 
where new initiatives are most needed. 

Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Helps the City identify and prioritize 

the areas in which the City’s efforts to 
tackle inequity have been successful 
and where additional initiatives are 
needed to address inequalities among

OPEN A CIVIC DESIGN LAB FOR PROBLEM 
SOLVING ACROSS CITY DEPARTMENTS AND 
IN COLLABORATION WITH PARTNERS

Description
The City of Oakland will launch the 
Civic Design Lab (CDL) on the 9th 
floor of City Hall, where resilience, 
digital services, and the arts converge. 
CDL will be a space for government 
innovation based on human-centered 
design. Human-centered design 
is a creative approach to problem 
solving that focuses on involving 
the community in creating solutions 
tailored specifically to their needs. 
CDL will bring individuals and teams 
from multiple departments together, 
including Resilience Delivery Teams, 
to engage in the following activities:
 ` Public Feedback Sessions (i.e., user 

testing). CDL will invite the public into 
the space to give the City feedback 
about tools, programs, and processes.

 ` Project-Based Fellowship. CDL 

will host City employees to 
engage in project-based work 
and frame the right questions for 
collaborative solution making.
 ` Workshops or “Labs” for City 

staff.  Labs will be designed to 
enable City staff to better build 
and implement digital services 
focused on user research, process 
design, and content development. 

 ` Engagement Events. As a gath-
ering place, CDL will be used to 
host small public events to foster 
engagement, convene like-minded 
innovators and technologists, and 
train City residents on how to access 
government services using online 

tools, foster engagement, and train 
residents on how to access govern-
ment services using online tools.
Benefits to Oakland Residents: 
 ` Cultivates meaningful engagement 

and trust among and between 
community and City staff by creating 
a space of facilitated conversations 
and continuous learning.

 ` Improves the public experience 

with government services.
 ` Deepens internal capacity 

building for problem solving 
and collective engagement.

 ` Increases collaboration 

throughout City Departments 
and increases efficiencies.
 ` Strengthens relationships 

between public servants and 
community members.

IMPLEMENT INTEGRATED ACTIONS 
THROUGH RESILIENCE DELIVERY TEAMS

Description
The City will set up “Resilience Delivery 
Teams,” internal working groups that 
will ensure coordination and account-
ability in resilience strategy refinement 
and implementing innovative solutions. 
These teams will be interdepart-
mental, with members from relevant 
agencies, and can include community 
stakeholders. Resilience Delivery 
Teams will be responsible for direct 
implementation, working with senior 
staff, City units, and departments, but 
will remain outside the regular orga-
nizational hierarchy. These teams will 
be uniquely positioned to coordinate 
across departments and functions, 
leveraging City talent and commit-
ment to achieve concrete results. 

For example, with regards to im-
plementing the green infrastructure 
plan, the Resilience Delivery Team will 
leverage interagency partnerships 
with Public Works, Transportation, 
and Planning & Building to develop:
 ` A plan of action that is 

anchored in evidence;

 ` A clear path to successful 

implementation of the plan;

 ` The ability to track progress and 

jointly solve problems along the way;

 ` An annual report or data 

dashboard on progress; and 

 ` An in-depth review that offers 

opportunities for the Resilience 
Delivery Team to carefully examine 
what has been achieved and 
what may need to change.

STRENGTHEN REGIONAL RESILIENCE 
THROUGH INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS, 
PROGRAMS, AND PILOTS

Description
The City of Oakland will participate in 
regional resilience partnerships with 
organizations including the Bay Area 
Regional Collective (BARC), Coastal 
Hazards Adaptation Resiliency Group 
(CHARG), and SuperPublic. BARC, 
with support from a Caltrans Regional 
Planning Grant, will coordinate  plan-
ning efforts to ensure the Bay Area 
transportation system is more resilient 
to increased flooding and sea level 
rise, while also improving the safety 
and sustainability of our communities, 
particularly our most vulnerable 
and disadvantaged communities. 

The City will also participate in regional 
pilots and programs. For example, the 
City of Oakland serves on the executive 
board of the Bay Area Resilient by 
Design challenge, a unique nine-county 
pilot to co-create a vision for vibrant 
climate adaptation along our shoreline 
as the rate of sea level rise, extreme 
storms, and urban flooding accelerates.
Benefits to Oakland Residents: 
 ` Leads to more creative, effective, 

and efficient approaches to 
addressing resilience challenges.  

 ` Creates more opportunities for 
Oakland residents and commu-
nity organizations to assess the 
potential risks and consequences, 
and observe, support, and par-
ticipate in resilience efforts.

FOCUSED ON PUBLIC NEEDS

MEASURE PERFORMANCE TO IMPROVE THE 
CITY’S RESILIENCE DECISION-MAKING

Description
The City of Oakland, in partnership 
with Code for America, has developed 
a foundational approach to digital 
service delivery. The main website aims 
to centralize and restructure digital 
communications and service delivery 
by implementing a more user-centric 
narrative that ties together information, 
service applications, and City data 
to inform and engage members of 
the Oakland community. The goal: to 
convey simplicity, trust and equity to 
the public in our visual and written 
communications. The digital services 
strategy will be used to establish a 
baseline of user research, visual design 
standards, and a content strategy 
that improves the way we deliver 
information and services online.
Benefits to Oakland Residents: 
 ` Makes information more accessible.
 ` Delivers information equitably 

to residents on both sides of 
the digital divide, regardless of 
device model/age or preference 
for mobile or desktop tools. 

 ` The design will be clean and easy 

to read, using plain language so 
it is both readable and easy to 
translate into multiple languages. 
 ` Residents are more likely to find 

the information they need and 
trust the information they find, 
creating a more collaborative 
relationship between City govern-
ment and the people we serve.

Description
The City of Oakland will seek to couple 
its Open Data Policy with a Data Gover-
nance Plan to increase data accessibil-
ity and centralize information. The City 
of Oakland, with pro bono support from 
Data Eaters (a team of data analysts), 
researched current database integrities 
and discrepancies, as well as principles 
of data analysis methods used in 
the field of resilience building. This 
research revealed the need for a Data 
Governance Plan to assist in the devel-
opment and maturity of data programs, 
including systems that reside on City-
owned servers managed by Information 
Technology Division staff, as well as 
systems hosted by external entities. 

Oakland’s Data Governance Plan  
aims to: 
 ` Enable better decision making; 
 ` Reduce operational friction;
 ` Protect the needs of 

data stakeholders; 

 ` Train management and staff to adopt 

common approaches to data issues; 

 ` Build standard, repeatable processes; 
 ` Reduce costs and increase 
effectiveness through coor-
dination of efforts; and 

 ` Ensure transparency of processes. 
Benefits to Oakland Residents: 
 ` Increased awareness of the data pro-
grams and the type of data collected. 

 ` Improved data system documen-

tation that accurately captures the 
extent and type of data collected.

Measuring performance is key to meet-
ing service delivery goals. For instance, 
as part of the digital work supporting 
the Rent Adjustment Program, we will 
start to create a performance frame-
work (e.g., guidelines that outline the 
service’s objectives and explain what 
data our team should gather to meet 
them); estimate the number of people 
you expect to use the service; deter-
mine the analytics tools already in use 
and whether they are suitable for the 
type and volume of data we’re expect-
ing; determine where existing data is 
kept and how to access it, aggregate 
it, and make it usable to measure our 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

By identifying a KPI for the digital ser-
vice improvement for the Rent Adjust-
ment Program, we seek to ensure that:
 ` The service is meeting 

residents’ needs;

 ` The service allows residents to 

easily complete the task;

 ` There are enough people using the 
service to make it cost-efficient; and

 ` People know about the service 

and choose to use it.

Benefits to Oakland Residents: 
 ` Helps to ensure City services 
are meeting residents’ needs.

Description
The City will launch the Youth–Plan, 
Learn, Act, Now! (Y-PLAN) initiative 
to partner with schools to engage 
students in research, data collection 
and analysis so our youth can prepare 
and present recommendations for 
healthier, more equitable, and more 
joyful cities to their city leaders. 
Given the disparate impacts of climate 
change, such as the impacts of sea 
level rise on communities of color, and 
the unequal distribution of climate 
risk throughout our communities, 
the City will implement the Y-PLAN, 
an award-winning initiative from UC 
Berkeley’s Center for Cities + Schools 
that empowers young people to tackle 
real-world problems in their commu-
nities through project-based civic 
learning experiences. As an essential 
component in the Oakland Resilience 
Challenge, Oakland is asking students 
to work with their Oakland public high 
school classes to answer the question: 
“What can the City of Oakland do to 
make targeted sites more socially and 
physically resilient to sea level rise?” 
Benefits to Oakland Residents: 
 ` Help youth develop their critical 

thinking, communication, collabora-
tion, and creativity skills as they gain 
understanding and awareness of the 
issues surrounding both physical and 
personal resilience to sea level rise. 

 ` Empower the students to work along-
side the City to contribute important

Description
Oakland will launch a Classrooms2Ca-
reers Program (formerly known as the 
Mayor’s Summer Job Program) that 
combines a career-oriented academic 
curricu lum, relevant work experience, 
and student financial assistance in 
a year-round program. Equity in 
resilience also means exposing and 
preparing Oakland’s diverse youth 
for careers and apprenticeships in 
resilience. Classrooms2Careers will: 
 ` Provide the flexibility stu dents need 
to acquire the knowledge and skills 
and earn a living at the same time;

 ` Teach students the work ethic 

and communications skills 
needed to make the transition 
into the workforce; and

 ` Give employers that participate in 

the program the edge they need 
to find qualified job candidates. 

Classrooms2Careers Program will 
launch at the National Linked Learning 
Conference in January 2017. Oakland 
will explore creating and launching a 
“Hire a Youth” campaign for businesses 
highlighting how we are working to 
better prepare talent for the businesses 
in Oakland. Oakland will also set a 
baseline by identifying how many 
work-eligible youth are in Oakland, 
then set goals and targets prioritizing 
young men and women of color, 
and consider out-of-school youth. 

Case Study: Y-PLAN Japan TOMODACHI Softbank Youth 
Leadership Program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Cities + Schools
The Center for Cities + Schools at UC Berkeley hosted a series of events to 
celebrate the 5-year anniversary and 700+ participants of the Y-PLAN Japan 
TOMODACHI Softbank Youth Leadership program.This leadership program, 
funded by SoftBank, is part of a larger effort in Japan and the US-Japan 
Council to strengthen cultural and economic ties between the two countries 
after the March 2011 triple disaster in Japan (earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear 
accident). Since the onset of the program, students from the Tohoku region 
affected by the events of March 2011 are selected each year to participate 
and focus on an urban planning and community development class.

For the 2016 summer program, the students focused on analyses and 
proposals for revitalization and disaster preparedness of Oakland’s Howard 
Terminal along the waterfront. In support of this effort, Chief Resilience 
Officer Kiran Jain participated alongside other local professionals in a 
final student project panel and discussion to provide feedback, exchange 
ideas, and learn from the Tohoku student’s experiences on resilience 
from the events of March 2011. Student proposals ranged from visions 
of a more connected Oakland to the ways in which technology could 
empower local culture, community centers, and place-making.

EDUCATE OAKLAND YOUTH ABOUT RESILIENCE 
ISSUES AND THE FUTURE OF OAKLAND 
THROUGH ARTS AND STORYTELLING

Description
Combining science, technology, engi-
neering, arts and math with creative 
storytelling, we will launch the Resilient 
Oakland coloring book and future city 
design challenges to empower Oakland 
youth to learn about community and 
physical resiliency. The purpose is for 
youth to discover what they can do 
to become the architects of their own 
futures. The Resilient Oakland coloring 
book aims to grow connections and 
resilience planning between and 
among residents of all ages, languages, 
cultures, and perspectives. Each 
chapter is comprised of snapshots 
in time from Oakland’s past, present, 
and future so people can connect on 
local history, envision present projects, 
and understand that what we imagine 
can become a vibrant, sustainable 
reality when we work together to 
create connected communities.
Benefits to Oakland Residents: 
 ` Empowers Oakland youth to imagine, 

describe, and illustrate what they 
want and need to do to recover 
quickly from adversity, and have an 
impact in creating safer neighbor-
hoods and prosperous communities.

The ‘secret sauce’ of Oakland is rooted in our people 
and the 75 neighborhoods they shape. The City is 
one of the most diverse major cities in the nation, 
with significant representation from Hispanic and 
Latino, Asian, and African American residents, as well 
as one of the country’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities.33

Diversity is also a source of economic vitality for many Oakland busi-
nesses.  Small businesses represent the foundation of Oakland’s local 
economy, with 90 percent of businesses in Oakland employing less than 
20 people. These businesses face challenges, such as rising commercial 
rents, increasing gentrification, and recent overall economic stagna-
tion. Given that many of the City’s small businesses are also located in 
low-income, minority-based neighborhoods, protecting the viability 
of these businesses is also a matter of equity and social justice.

On the housing side, a majority of Oakland’s housing stock is in older, pre-
World War II buildings. Property owners with limited means, especially seniors 
and households still recovering from the economic recession, experience 
difficulty supporting home repairs, property taxes, and insurance. Oakland’s 
neighborhoods that continue to be hardest hit by foreclosures are in low- to 
moderate-income flatland neighborhoods, including those with historically 
high rates of African American homeownership. These same neighborhoods are 
also disproportionately impacted by vacant and abandoned properties, which 
attract vandalism and dumping, drain City resources, decrease tax revenues, 
and depress both property values and community vitality.  At the same time, 
Oakland is experiencing an unprecedented need for new affordable housing.  

Economic and housing security is key to a thriving town that protects our 
diversity. Oakland will build and finance affordable housing to support 
long-term residents’ ability to stay and accommodate our growing popula-
tion. Oakland will enhance the quality of life in its neighborhoods through 
cross-cutting and integrated initiatives that improve safety, health, and 
the economic assets and security of its low-income residents and people 
of color, so that they are not only able to weather shocks and stresses, 
but with quality housing, educational opportunities, and jobs. Oakland 
will also explore 21st century business models, such as the ‘circular econ-
omy,’ that support restorative and regenerative businesses by design.

“The diversity of Oakland’s 

entrepreneurs as well as 
their business ideas is 
pretty breathtaking.”

“Oakland is the heart and 

soul of the sustainable 
economy movement.”

“We are fierce 
localists here in 
Oakland. That 
means we care 
about where we 
buy our things.” 

“Oakland is a 

melting pot, but 
it won’t continue 
to be if rent keeps 
rising and long-
term residents 

continue to leave.”

“Oakland is the 

hottest residential 
real estate market 

in the Bay Area 

right now.”

GOAL: INCREASE 
ECONOMIC SECURITY

Oakland will enable all residents to be economically secure, build wealth, and 
achieve their full potential, regardless of race or means. Oakland seeks to build 
a model of responsible economic growth and business attraction, in concert 
with a commitment to building economic security, especially for those who have 
historically had limited access to opportunity.

Action:   Support asset building for low-income parents and children 

through Oakland Promise College Savings Initiatives

Action:   Create pathways to career success for 

young men and women of color

Action:   Design a suite of inclusive economic development services to help 

entrepreneurs of color gain equal footing in Oakland’s economy

Action:   Align economic resilience goals with the Oakland Thrives wealth 

GOAL: PROMOTE SAFE AND 
HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS

Oakland’s neighborhoods will be made safer through implementating programs 
that improve the health, well-being, and safety of our families. The City’s holistic 
approach to community safety focuses on helping families thrive, neighborhoods 
becoming safer, and communities healing from trauma and restoring their trust in 
the police.

Action:   Redesign digital service for Oakland’s Rent Adjustment Program to 

mitigate displacement

Action:   Implement the 2016 Oakland Comprehensive Community Safety Plan

Action:   Promote resilience and equity for Oakland’s high-risk youth 

and adults most affected by trauma and violence

Action:   Advance the health and well-being of Oakland youth and families

Action:   Launch Neighbors Helping Neighbors initiative to expand the reach of 

emergency preparedness and response training in  
underserved neighborhoods

GOAL: INCREASE AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING STOCK

As the regional economy has boomed, Oakland’s housing stock has not kept 
pace with the number of people who want to live in Oakland. As a result, home 
prices and rents have become out of reach for many of Oakland’s long-time 
residents. Oakland will seek to improve access to affordable housing by creating 
new affordable homes.

Action:   Provide gap financing for affordable housing in transit-accessible 

neighborhoods

Action:   Acquire and rehabilitate vacant, abandoned and blighted properties 

into green, healthy, and permanently affordable homes

Description
Our vision is that all children of Oakland 
graduate high school with the expecta-
tion, resources, and skills to complete 
college and succeed in the career of 
their choice. Oakland Promise is an 
innovative and comprehensive initiative 
launched in January 2016. Two pro-
grams of the Oakland Promise, Brilliant 
Baby and Kindergarten to College 
(K2C), will establish college savings 
accounts and an early expectation 
of academic and college success for 
young children. Brilliant Baby is be-
ginning as a three-year demonstration 
project, that will open college savings 
accounts seeded with $500 for 1,500 
of Oakland’s most economically vul-
nerable and under-resourced families. 
Parents will be recruited to also partici-
pate in a program of financial coaching 
and parenting support designed to 
reduce stressors in the household and 
promote effective early parenting.

(K2C) is being launched in partnership 
with Oakland Unified School District 
with the goal of creating a college-go-
ing culture in our public schools and 
within our children beginning in ele-
mentary school. A cornerstone of the 
K2C program is establishing a college 
savings account seeded with $100 for 
each child as they enroll in kindergar-
ten, with the common experience of 
owning a college savings account as a 
concrete tool for each child and family 
in the process. Parents will also be 
encouraged to begin saving their own 
funds towards their child’s college.

CREATE PATHWAYS TO CAREER SUCCESS 
FOR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR

Description
Oakland will advance the My Brother’s 
Keeper Local Action Plan, a coordinat-
ed national initiative launched by the 
White House to improve long-term out-
comes of men and boys of color. The 
Local Action Plan provides strategies to 
help ensure children enter kindergarten 
ready to learn, all students graduate 
from high school ready for college 
and career, and students have access 
to higher education or job training. 

As part of Oakland Promise, Oakland 
will launch Future Centers, which 
are college and career hubs on mid-
dle-school and high-school campuses.  
Future Centers will provide support to 
these students to develop college and 
career plans. Future Centers will also 
help connect students with financial 
aid, scholarships, and internships.

The Classroom2Careers program will 
also offer meaningful opportunities 
for Oakland youth to gain real-world 
internship experience.  Further, the City 
is developing a strategy for an inclusive 
technology ecosystem referred to as 
'tech-quity' that paves the path for 
preparing Oaklanders for entrepre-
neurial and employment opportunities 
within the technology industry.
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Increases access to quality 

educational and career oppor-
tunities for Oakland youth.

 ` Increases opportunities for individ-

uals and families of color to build 
wealth through quality careers.

DESIGN A SUITE OF INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TO HELP 
ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR GAIN EQUAL 
FOOTING IN OAKLAND’S ECONOMY

Description
The City will expand programs to 
benefit lower-income and minority 
entrepreneurs, including the Kiva loan 
program and an Online Business Portal 
(December 2016), to help small busi-
ness start, scale their operations and 
increase jobs. Comparable community 
efforts include the one-stop center. 
These efforts should be integrated into 
an inclusive suite of services that help 
local businesses to expand, including 
referrals to service providers, location 
assistance, mentoring, and hiring 
assistance. In the 2012 U.S. Census 
survey of business owners, 51 percent 
of Oakland businesses are owned by 
people of color, but they generally 
have lower sales and fewer employees 
than white-owned businesses. 

Under the Kiva Oakland partnership, 
over the next three years, Kiva will:
 ` Fund over 600 entrepreneurs 
endorsed by over 50 Trustees;

 ` Generate $3M of loan 

volume by Year 3;

 ` Generate $6M in incremen-

tal economic impact;

 ` Maintain repayment rate of 

over 90 percent; and

 ` Establish over 20,000 connec-
tions between borrowers and 
lenders; many local lenders 
will become customers.

 ` Launch OakTEN (Tech Entrepreneurs 

Network) with the Kapor Center 
for Social Impact and DevLabs to 
support entrepreneurs of color 

by reducing the time and costs 
associated with starting a business.

 Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Creates a diverse and thriv-
ing job base that supports 
communities of color.
 ` Builds assets for com-

munities of color.

ALIGN ECONOMIC RESILIENCE GOALS WITH THE 
OAKLAND THRIVES WEALTH IMPACT TABLE

Description
Through the Oakland Thrives 
wealth impact table, the City and its 
partners will implement the Mayor’s 
economic resilience and security 
goals to reduce the asset poverty 
rate, unemployment rate and increase 
living wage jobs in Oakland, including 
the following 10-year goals: 
 ` Reduce the asset poverty rate of 
African Americans (63 percent) 
and Latinos (69 percent) by half. 
 ` Reduce the unemployment rate 

of African Americans (14 percent) 
and Latinos (9.7 percent) by half.

 ` Increase the percentage of 
Oaklanders that have living 
wages by 50 percent.

In addition, the City will also explore 
building upon the Oakland Housing 
Authority pilot “Promise Plus” project 
that aligns housing, jobs, financial 
services, and education to increase 
financial self sufficiency; and develop a 
centralized platform that links residents 
seeking financial security with access to 
capital, financial education, and credit 
repair to remove barriers to employ-
ment, housing and wealth building.
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Builds an economically and culturally 

diverse city where all people are 
economically secure, build wealth, 
and are able to achieve their full 
potential regardless of race or means.

REDESIGN DIGITAL SERVICE FOR 
OAKLAND’S RENT ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM 
TO MITIGATE DISPLACEMENT

Description
The City will redesign the Rent Adjust-
ment Program (RAP) website in order 
to more effectively provide services, 
which include contesting actions such 
as illegal rent increases, improper no-
ticing, and decreased  housing services 
or living conditions. To achieve this, the 
City has undertaken a human-centered 
design approach to determine how 
best to redesign the RAP website and 
database to increase access, while also 
rethinking program service-delivery 

processes. The RAP is the City of 
Oakland’s main mechanism for resolv-
ing disputes between property owners 
and renters. Approximately 70 percent 
of Oakland’s estimated 100,000 rental 
units are currently covered under the 
RAP. Improvements are focused on:
 ` Replacing the existing paper 

filing system with an electronic 
case management system;

 ` Improving the existing database; and  
 ` Upgrading or replacing the RAP 

website to make it easier for

GOAL: PROMOTE SAFE AND HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS

GOAL: PROMOTE SAFE AND HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS

IMPLEMENT THE 2016 OAKLAND 
COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY SAFETY PLAN

Description
The Mayor’s Comprehensive Com-
munity Safety Plan guides the City’s 
overall efforts towards increasing safety 
through engaging the entire communi-
ty. The Plan’s theory of change presents 
community violence as a public health 
challenge. To fulfill the vision of Oak-
land as one of the healthiest and safest 
cities in the United States, the Plan 
focuses on three goals: 1) thriving youth 
and families, 2) safe neighborhoods, 
and 3) restorative city. These goals 
range from providing educational, 
employment, and cultural opportunities 
for youth most vulnerable to becoming 
victims or perpetrators of violence, 
to accounting for historical inequities 
and injustices that have led to current 
conditions of violence and trauma. The 
Plan will create a common framework 
for collective accountability, aligning 
the resources of the City, Oakland 
Unified School District and Alameda 
County with other government agen-
cies, community-based organizations 
and philanthropy. For each goal 
developed, the City will explore setting 
Key Performance Indicators to track 
progress using open data, and will 
collaborate with City and County stake-
holders, community partners, and other 
members to discuss intent, additional 
opportunities, and implementation.  

Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Increases pathways to success for 

all young people in Oakland. 

 ` Improves housing stability 

and increases economic 
stability for families.

 ` Leads to improved response 
times and ratings for police 
services through community 
and resident surveys.

PROMOTE RESILIENCE AND EQUITY FOR 
OAKLAND’S HIGH-RISK YOUTH AND ADULTS 
MOST AFFECTED BY TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE

Description
Oakland’s Resiliency in Communities 
After Stress and Trauma (ReCAST) pro-
gram seeks to promote resiliency and 
equity for Oakland’s high-risk youth 
and adults most affected by trauma 
and violence. In partnership with a 
multi-sector coalition of stakeholders, 
the City will work to improve behavioral 
health outcomes and reduce trauma 
among the highest-risk young people 
and their families, empower community 
residents, and improve community-po-
lice relations. Oakland ReCAST will 
build on three City divisions that serve 
Oakland’s most marginalized, at-risk 
populations in need of trauma-informed 
behavioral health supports: Head Start, 
Oakland Fund for Children & Youth, 
and Oakland Unite, Oakland’s violence 
intervention initiative. Together, 
these divisions reach over 50,000 
young people and families through a 
network of local service providers.

The goals of Oakland ReCAST include: 
 ` Expanding access to trauma-informed 
behavioral health services by enhanc-
ing use of evidence-based models 
among City-funded human service 
programs and developing a service 
pipeline to County-funded services; 

 ` Providing coordinated training to 
community-based social service 
providers and law enforcement 
entities to increase use of trau-
ma-informed practices; and 

 ` Supporting the work of community 

partners to address tensions in 
law enforcement-community 
relations and to promote com-
munity resiliency and healing.

Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Helps to ensure that City services 

are meeting residents’ needs.

 ` Reduces taxpayer costs by 

reducing the unnecessary use of 
emergency services and jails.  
 ` Improves health outcomes and 

job prospects for individuals and 
reduces disruption to families.

Description
As part of the State of California’s 
“Cap and Trade” program, revenue is 
allocated to the Affordable Housing 
and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) 
program. AHSC funds land-use, 
housing, transportation, and land 
preservation to support infill and 
compact developments that reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

For the first round of AHSC funding, 
based upon an annual Notice of 
Funding Availability (NOFA) pro-
cess, Oakland has applied to fund 
seven compact transit-oriented 
development-related affordable 
housing projects to help increase the 
affordable housing pipeline. These 
funds would be crucial to providing gap 
financing for affordable housing units 
in transit-accessible neighborhoods. 

Moving forward, the City is in the pro-
cess of developing a system to identify 
and provide commitments towards 
projects that would be competitive for 
the future AHSC NOFA applications. 
By maintaining a steady supply of 
competitive AHSC applications, the 
City would be able to both address the 
need for affordable housing and also 
achieve a triple bottom line approach 
(economic, social and environmental 
benefits) to new developments.

Description
The City is exploring several innovative 
funding mechanisms and approaches 
that realize the triple bottom line of 
preserving existing housing stock, 
transforming blighted and vacant 
properties into productive reuse, and 
bringing new affordable units online. 

The City is developing opportunities to 
support nonprofit organizations to buy 
and rehabilitate existing buildings that 
house lower-income Oaklanders—and 
making them permanently affordable 
to current and future residents. 
Utilizing funding from Measure KK 
(potential infrastructure bond), the 
City is pursuing a gap funding subsidy 
for developers to maintain these 
properties as permanently affordable. 

In addition, the City has also launched 
From Blight to Homes, an innovative 
pilot partnership with the Alameda 
County Tax Collector and affordable 
housing developers to turn tax-default-
ed, abandoned lots into scattered-site, 
affordable rental and ownership 
housing for low-income households.  

Additionally, the City and County 
are working on providing property 
tax reductions and relief from out-
standing fees and fines—such as fines 
associated with code violations—to 
make financial assistance to owners 
of these properties more effective. 

Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Provides a mechanism to keep 

Oaklanders in their homes, while 
increasing the affordable housing 
stock in a cost-effective manner 
and addressing the twin problems 
of deteriorating housing conditions 
and vacant/abandoned properties.

Oakland needs to rethink its traditional approach to infrastructure, es-
pecially given the City’s strong commitment to renewable energy and 
efficiency goals, as well as green infrastructure projects. Though not 
addressed in this playbook, Oakland also needs to think about digital 
infrastructure and how that relates to smart cities, the “internet of things,” 
and greater data collection through sensors, which can also help prioritize 
limited capital improvement dollars.  Oakland envisions a transformative 
approach to creating vibrant, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure.

D Oakland’s transportation network, utilities, and 
housing stock have helped it achieve a diverse 
N
and booming economy. Yet infrastructure, such 
A
as the storm drainage system and streets, is

Oakland will proactively prepare its infrastructure and communities for 
climate and seismic risks through physical retrofits, planning, and robust 
community engagement. Oakland will use green infrastructure to manage 
stormwater, so that while also reducing flood risks, we are also providing 
urban greening benefits, such as improved air quality and reduced urban 
heat island effects, especially for neighborhoods that have limited access 
to parks and green space. Bringing Oakland into the 21st century will 
require a significant amount of investment that will need to be generated 
in new and creative ways. Oakland will explore piloting new financing 
opportunities and seek to replicate the most promising methods.

GOAL: REDUCE CURRENT 
AND FUTURE CLIMATE 
AND SEISMIC RISKS

Oakland is planning for a future where climate-related hazards are more frequent 
and intense, including coastal flooding, watershed flooding, extreme heat, and 
drought. In addition, Oakland is preparing for the risk of an earthquake on the 
Hayward fault and will continue its efforts to retrofit homes to reduce the loss 
of life and property. Some Oakland residents are more vulnerable to climate 
and seismic disasters than others, particularly low-income neighborhoods and 
communities of color. The City will continue to seek to partner with, and build the 
resilience of, those communities.

Action:   Demonstrate the retrofit of a city block using Ecoblock principles

Action:   Implement the 2016 Update to the Energy and Climate Action Plan 

Action:   Design and implement a soft-story retrofit program

Action:   Implement the Preliminary Sea Level Rise Road Map

Action:   Implement high-priority actions from the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan

Action:   Assess equity impacts and feasibility of 100-percent clean and 

renewable energy

Action:   Improve community resilience through risk modeling

GOAL: PROVIDE URBAN 
GREENING FOR NEIGHBORHOODS 
MOST IN NEED

Green infrastructure can bring many benefits to communities—beyond protecting 
and improving water quality entering storm drains, and providing compliance 
with Federal and State regulations. Oakland is eager to increase the use of 
green infrastructure to provide additional benefits, such as improved air quality, 
reduced urban heat island effect, creating habitat, and improving the experience 
of the public realm. These are especially important benefits for neighborhoods 
that have historically lacked access to parks, creeks, and street trees. 

Action:   Identify and leverage funding opportunities for Priority  

Conservation Areas

Action:   Update the Storm Drainage Master Plan to guide future investment in 

stormwater management

Action:   Prioritize parks and open spaces using resilience-related criteria

Action:   Develop a Green Infrastructure Plan to improve social, environmental, 

and economic resilience outcomes 

GOAL: MAXIMIZE VALUE OF 
COLLECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE 
INVESTMENTS

$

While the City is seeking a $600M bond measure in November 2016 for 
housing and community infrastructure (Measure KK), the level of infrastructure 
investment that Oakland envisions cannot be achieved with traditional 
investment tools alone. Oakland will explore and pilot innovative financing 
mechanisms, and apply the lessons learned from those pilots more broadly. The 
City will explore how to best leverage the City’s budget to partner with residents, 
businesses, and other organizations to achieve our goals. 

Action:   Apply a resilience, mobility, and equity lens to assess and select 

capital improvement projects

Action:   Explore participation in County’s Community Choice  

Aggregation program

Action:   Explore innovative financing tools for resilience projects,  

including EcoBlocks

DEMONSTRATE THE RETROFIT OF A CITY 
BLOCK USING ECOBLOCK PRINCIPLES 

Description
The EcoBlock project team will work in 
close collaboration with the owners and 
residents of a small, older residential 
neighborhood to retrofit an entire 
North Oakland block that includes 
approximately 30 older homes, many 
subdivided into two to three smaller 
units. The project will include imple-
menting deep energy efficiency in all 
homes and shared rooftop solar panel, 
creating a solar-powered microgrid 
with smart controls and onsite energy 
storage that can operate autonomously. 

Electricity generated on site will be 
sufficient to power electric vehicle 
chargers, which may serve as a shared 
resource for the community. The 
EcoBlock will drive significant water 
conservation through rooftop water 
harvesting and advanced technologies 
to treat and recycle water onsite.  
Recycled water will irrigate shared or-
ganic fruit and vegetable gardens and 
landscaping to keep the block lush and 
mitigate the urban heat-island effect.

The EcoBlock will serve as a prototype, 
in the hopes that it can be replicated

GOAL: REDUCE CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS

IMPLEMENT THE 2016 UPDATE TO THE 
ENERGY AND CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A SOFT 
STORY RETROFIT PROGRAM

Description
The Energy Climate and Action Plan 
(ECAP) plan has been updated in  
order to:
 ` Reprioritize action items to accurately 

reflect accomplishments to date, 
items complete or substantially 
underway, new community priorities, 
and/or new opportunities and con-
straints; and

 ` Revise language where necessary to 
better capture the original intent of 
each action item, while accounting 
for changes in the economic, social, 
technological, or climatic context.

Feedback from implementing divisions, 
partner agencies, community stake-
holders, and community business lead-
ers, will inform the update. The revised 
ECAP will set priorities for the remain-
ing period leading up to the 2020 goal 
year and establish the baseline on 
which a 2030 ECAP will be predicated.

Oakland’s ECAP, adopted by Council 
in 2012, was written with extraor-
dinary community engagement.  It 
contains 175 action items across five 
thematic areas (Building Energy 
Use, Transportation and Land Use, 
Materials Use and Waste, Community 
Engagement, and Adaptation and 
Resilience to Climate Change), 61 of 
which were three-year priorities.  The 
ECAP aims to achieve a 36 percent 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
relative to 2005 levels by 2020. 

Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Revives community engagement in 

and familiarity with local and citywide 
resilience and sustainability issues.  

 ` Re-establishes a sense of community 

ownership over the city’s efforts to 
simultaneously combat and adapt to 
climate change.

 ` Ensures that environmental justice 
remains a centerpiece of the City’s 
climate agenda.

for ongoing implementation

Funding: ECAP implementation 
is dependent on diverse ongoing 
funding for a wide array of actions.

Related goals: Create more opportu-

Description
Oakland is developing a program that 
will provide limited financial support 
to owners of soft-story apartment 
buildings for seismic retrofits. This 
program will help the City enhance 
interdepartmental coordination and 
pilot streamlined processes to expedite 
soft-story retrofits. Simultaneously, 
the City will continue to explore policy 
tools, such as a retrofit ordinance, 
that would more effectively mitigate 
the hazard posed by un-retrofitted 
soft-story buildings.Soft-story 
apartment buildings are at particular 
risk of structural damage or even 
collapse from an earthquake due to a 
lack of adequate strength in their first 
story. They account for approximately 
22,000 housing units in Oakland. 

To enroll eligible properties in this pilot 
program, the City will explore ways 
to reach out to owners of soft-story 
apartment buildings at risk of earth-
quake damage, including working with 
rental housing associations, print and 
media advertising, and direct mail to 
owners of eligible buildings identified 
during the City’s preliminary screening.  

In addition to the soft-story retrofit 
program, which targets apartment 
buildings of five or more units, 
Oakland also received FEMA grant 
funding to provide financial assistance 
to owner-occupants for seismic 
retrofits of one to four unit homes. 
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Helps prevent human injury, loss of 

life, and damage to or loss of housing 

units and reduce costs associated 
with these negative impacts.

 ` Reduces displacement and keeps 
residents in their homes following 
a major earthquake, helping to 
preserve Oakland’s diversity and 
reduce the costs of rapidly re-
housing displaced residents.
 ` Reduces recovery time from 
an earthquake as residents in 
stable housing can more readily 
return to jobs and schools and 
contribute to the local economy.

Lead: Housing and Community 
Development Department

Partners: Planning and Building De-
partment, FEMA, California Governor’s 
Office of Emergency Services.

Timeframe: Outreach and compile 
master list of eligible properties from 
October 2016 to  March 2017.  Plan 
check, construction, and inspections 
from April 2017 to September 2019.

Funding: The City has received 
$117,500 from FEMA for Phase I of the 
program, which will include outreach 
to owners of eligible properties, 
establishment of a master inventory 
list, and collection of owner consent 
agreements.  Phase II funding, up 
to $2,882,500 for construction and 
program implementation, will be 
approved by FEMA if Phase I demon-
strates that the program is eligible.

to the Community

As also identified in the Energy and 
Climate Action Plan (ECAP), the 
City will engage with the Oakland 
community about SLR impacts, laying 
the foundation for public discussion of 
future planning decisions and adapta-
tion strategies. In partnership with local 
community groups, the City will seek 
to communicate information about SLR 
impacts to the Oakland community, 
particularly those who may be most 
vulnerable, such as communities of 
color and low-income communities. 
Near-term opportunities include the 
ECAP Update, Plan Downtown Oakland 
outreach, and CORE and Neighbors 
Helping Neighbors programs. 

Enable and Use  
Community-Generated Data

The City will seek opportunities for 
residents to provide additional infor-
mation critical to SLR mapping efforts, 
including factors affecting localized 
flooding, such as areas of illegal 
dumping, infrastructure conditions, and 
unique neighborhood attributes. This 
activity could be facilitated through a 
partnership with a digital provider so 
community partners can map neighbor-
hood-specific conditions for inclusion 
in SLR adaptation plans and actions.

Identify Funding to Complete Citywide 
Vulnerability and Risk Assessment

East Oakland and the Coliseum Area 
have undergone vulnerability assess-
ments as part of the Adapting to Rising 
Tides Program. In addition, the Port will 
be assessing its maritime facilities, and 
developing an implementation plan for 
near- and long-term SLR adaptation 
strategies. Additional community areas 
such as West Oakland, the Central 
Estuary, and Jack London Square are 
also vulnerable and in need of similar 
assessments. The City will identify 
funding to complete vulnerability and 
risk assessments for vulnerable areas 
and assets that have not yet been stud-
ied. The City will seek to partner with 
the Oakland Climate Action Coalition 

and other local groups to ensure that 
residents in Oakland’s vulnerable com-
munities are engaged in the vulnerabil-
ity assessment process. In addition, the 
City will collaborate with all appropriate 
local, County, and regional agencies.  
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Increases opportunities for residents 
to learn about the potential impacts 
of SLR on local neighborhoods and 
more effectively plan for personal 
impacts during storm events.
 ` Strengthens communication 

between and among residents 
and the City regarding critical 
safety issues, and facilitate greater 
participation among the commu-
nity in developing solutions.  

 ` Helps ensure that the City and 

other agencies are taking a coor-
dinated and proactive approach 
to SLR adaptation and planning.

SEA LEVEL RISE ROAD MAP 

Description
Through the resilience strategy 
development process, Oakland has 
developed a Preliminary Sea Level 
Rise (SLR) Road Map, which includes 
priority coordination and adaptation 
actions to guide the City’s work in 
the near-term (through 2018).  

The document seeks to: 
 ` Summarize the most up-to-date 

climate science, relevant policies and 
regulations, and vulnerability and risk 
assessments conducted to date;

 ` Identify information gaps and estab-

lish needs for further assessment;

 ` Provide the foundation and 

guidance to develop a citywide 
SLR adaptation plan; and 

 ` Identify opportunities for engage-

ment, collaboration, and coordination.

Priority actions are grouped in the cate-
gories of: (1) community engagement 
and collaboration, (2) regional coor-
dination, (3) understanding neighbor-
hood vulnerabilities, and (4) enabling 
climate-smart development.  There are 
a total of 22 actions in the Road Map,

GOAL: REDUCE CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE RISKS

IMPLEMENT HIGH-PRIORITY ACTIONS FROM 
THE LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN

ASSESS EQUITY IMPACTS AND FEASIBILITY OF 
100-PERCENT CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY

Description
Oakland will prioritize the 21 mitigation 
strategies outlined in Oakland’s 2016 
to 2021 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan 
(LHMP). Mitigation strategies in the 
LHMP include retrofitting building and 
facilities to reduce earthquake risks, 
infrastructure improvements to reduce 
temporary flooding and permanent in-
undation, fire prevention strategies, and 
emergency planning and preparedness. 
These mitigation strategies seek to 
reduce potential damage to infrastruc-
ture and the dislocation and disruption 
to Oaklanders' lives resulting from a 
hazard. In addition, the LHMP seeks to 
ensure that all future Specific Plans and 
General Plan updates include an analy-
sis of projected sea level rise and other 
hazards that are projected to become 
more extreme as a result of climate 
change, and where necessary, incorpo-
rate appropriate mitigation strategies. 

The plan recognizes that climate 
change threatens Oakland with both 
discrete shocks (coastal floods, 
increased wildfire risks) and continual 
or periodic stresses (rising seas and 
droughts). Oakland’s low-income resi-
dents, communities of color, the elderly, 
and children may be disproportionately 
vulnerable to these increasing threats.
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Reduces the loss of life and property 

 ` Preserves environmental quality 
by minimizing damage to natural 
resources from identified hazards.

Lead: The implementation of 
actions will be led by various 
departments, including Planning 
and Building Department, Public 
Works Department, Fire Department 
(Emergency Management Services 
Division) and the Port of Oakland

Partners: Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency, State of California 
Office of Emergency Services , As-
sociation of Bay Area Governments 

Timeframe: 2016 to 2021

Funding: Oakland is seeking 
funding to implement several 
of the mitigation strategies

Related goals: Promoting safe and 
healthy neighborhoods; Provide 
urban greening for neighborhoods 
most in need; Maximize value of 
collective infrastructure investments

from hazards.

Challenges Addressed: 

 ` Improves recovery time in the 

event of a disaster and safeguards 
Oakland’s economic welfare, reducing 
dislocation and disruption.  

Description
The City of Oakland is working with 
community based organizations, 
philanthropies, nonprofits, and the 
Urban Sustainability Directors Network 
to assess the equity impacts of tran-
sitioning to a 100-percent electricity 
supply provided by renewable energy.  
A future powered by renewable energy 
has the potential to lower greenhouse 
gases and mitigate against the po-
tentially devastating consequences of 
climate change.  However, the transition 
to this future must be managed in ways 
that address historic inequities in the 
way energy is provided.  This includes 
the impacts associated with the siting 
of renewable energy facilities such 
as solar photovoltaic and geothermal 
systems, the cost implications for 
low-income households, and the 
workforce impacts of transitioning from 
existing power sources.  Additional 
issues will likely arise as community 
groups discuss the issue and identify 
the ways in which energy affects the 
lives of people of color and low income 
communities.  This work remains in 
early stage, as the City and its partners 
seek additional financing, organization-
al alignment, and strategy guidance.  
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` This assessment has the potential 

to increase equity conditions 
for all residents by proactively 
addressing impacts on this issue.  
 ` Implementation of the assessment 

may improve economic and job 
development prospects, reduce 
the potential for inequities in 
siting energy facilities, and increase 
fairness in the delivery of new

IMPROVE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE 
THROUGH RISK MODELING

Description
The City of Oakland will explore launch-
ing a pilot project to more effectively 
integrate risk assessment and mitiga-
tion planning resources into the larger 
array of community planning processes. 
This will include working with the com-
munity to identify appropriate “points 
of intervention” for the integration of 
relevant models, tools, and methods 
into the local planning process. Efforts 
will be made to ensure that a reason-
able number of community planning 
examples are used in order to capture 
a sufficient range of points of interven-
tion and subsequent strategies relevant 
to all applicable planning areas. The 
end result is to identify opportunities 
for identifying and reducing hazard 
risks in support of the overall mission 
of supporting community resilience. 

Example 1: Integrate new risk reduction 
models, tools, and methods into 
existing plans such as the General 
Plan, neighborhood and area plans, 
green infrastructure planning pro-
cesses, etc., as may be appropriate. 

Example 2: Introduce approach-
es that can be “banked” for 
integrating into the next 5-year 
hazard mitigation plan update.
 
Benefits to Oakland Residents
City staffers, stakeholders, partners, 
and residents of the City of Oakland 
and Alameda County will benefit 
from an increased awareness of the 
models, tools, and methods available 
to enhance community resilience. 

86

These resources will be used to further 
integrate risk reduction principles 
and practices into a wide array of 
existing community planning processes. 
Specific opportunities may include 
tools for environmental justice, green 
infrastructure, and any perceived 
“gaps” in local planning resources.

IDENTIFY AND LEVERAGE FUNDING 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRIORITY 
CONSERVATION AREAS

Description
The City and its community partners 
will seek to identify and leverage 
funding opportunities for investing in 
Priority Conservation Areas (PCAs) 
using the equity checklist adopted 
by City Council resolution and 
developed by the Oakland Climate 
Action Coalition, as a framework for 
prioritization. City staff will work 
with community leaders to develop 
a formal community engagement 
process for prioritizing projects 
and allocating funding, which will 
be informed by the work done 
under Action: Develop principles for 
community engagement in Oakland. 

PCAs are prioritized by regional 
agencies for targeted investments 
in parks, urban greening, nature 
preservation and rehabilitation, 
recreation activities, planning efforts, 
and other programs. A recent update 
to Plan Bay Area34 has allowed PCAs 
to be designated to provide funding 
opportunities for urban greening 
which includes, creek and habitat 
protection, use of plants and soil to 
treat stormwater and improving food 
sources in urban environments. 

The designation of Oakland’s 
PCAs had significant contribution 
from community stakeholders, 
including neighborhoods challenged 
by environmental impacts, food 
access, and parks deficits. 

Measure AA, the “San Francisco Bay 
Clean Water, Pollution Prevention 
and Habitat Restoration Program,”is 

also a potential funding opportunity 
for possible Oakland PCA projects. 
Measure AA is projected to raise about 
$25 million per year to restore wetlands 
and protect shorelines throughout the 
nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.  
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Generates investment in parks, 
open space, creek restoration, 
rain gardens, green streets and 
other forms of urban greening.

 ` Promotes cohesive and 

engaged communities.

 ` Ensures that City planners have 
a more complete picture of the 
conservation, restoration, and 
environmental justice needs of 
disadvantaged communities.

 ` Increases equity in allocation of 
climate and resilience resources. 

Lead: Public Works Department, 
Planning and Building Depart-
ment, Chief Resilience Officer

Partners: Oakland Climate Action 
Coalition, Association of Bay 
Area Governments, San Francisco 
Bay Restoration Authority

Timeframe: Near-term (1 to 3 years)

Funding: The City and partners will 
seek funding guided by the equity 
checklist, including Measure AA grants

UPDATE THE STORM DRAINAGE MASTER 
PLAN TO GUIDE FUTURE INVESTMENT 
IN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Description
The City of Oakland will develop an 
updated Storm Drainage Master Plan 
(SDMP) that will include a comprehen-
sive asset management system and 
state-of-the art modeling that evaluates 
how the system performs under differ-
ent storm scenarios and incorporates 
precipitation changes and sea level 
rise due to climate change.  The City’s 
existing 2006 SDMP, has fallen out of 
date and the storm drainage system is 
in critical need of maintenance, repairs, 
and upgrades. The SDMP will be used 
to identify critical maintenance and im-
provement projects that will reduce po-
tentially costly and dangerous flooding. 
The updated SDMP aims to be a living 
document that is continuously updated 
as a vital tool for guiding investment 
in the City’s storm drainage system. 

Because of the topography of Oakland, 
flooding hotspots typically coincide 
with low-income neighborhoods. 
The City will explore using an equity 
checklist to guide the project prioriti-
zation process, potentially overlaying 
socio-economic data with modeling 
on flooding hotspots and other 
known stormwater problem areas. As 
described in the Oakland Preliminary 
Sea Level Rise Road Map, the City will 
also seek opportunities for residents 
of Oakland neighborhoods to provide 
information on factors affecting 
localized flooding. This activity could 
be facilitated through a partnership 
with an online engagement platform, 
so community members can map 
hot spots for creek or coastal-caused 
flooding they are already experi-
encing in their neighborhoods.

88

Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Neighborhoods and streets are 
less likely to flood during storm 
events, reducing the risk of damage 
to homes, injury, or disruption 
to transit or daily routines.

Partners: Alameda County Flood Con-
trol and Water Conservation District

Timeframe: Near-term (1 to 2 years)

PRIORITIZE PARKS AND OPEN SPACES 
USING RESILIENCE-RELATED CRITERIA

Description
The City is developing conceptual 
plans and budgets for approximately 
20 Parks and Open Space projects 
(including park facilities) as part 
of a Parks Project Prioritization 
Development program. The plan will 
allow the City to define scopes and 
complete preliminary design and 
cost estimates for projects, which is 
instrumental in positioning the City 
for grant opportunities. The sites 
will be evaluated against a range of 
resilience related criteria including 
equity, health and safety, environmental 
and economic performance, and 
operation and maintenance feasibility.

Community engagement will be 
an integral part of the process. The 
Office of Parks and Recreation (OPR) 
holds annual feedback sessions with 
communities throughout the City 
and receives feedback from the 
public who provides input through 
Council Offices about local parks and 
recreational facilities. Staff maintains 
communication with numerous 
community groups and non-profit 
organizations, such as Oakland 
Park Coalition, Oakland Parks and 
Recreation Foundation, Measure DD 
Coalition, to understand the priorities 
and concerns. Having the Park 
Project Prioritization list has allowed 
community groups to support and 
focus on priorities as well as partner 
with the City to implement some 
of the projects. During the project 
development process, consultants 
will work with staff to incorporate 
limited outreach to users for input in 

determining project scopes. When 
project funds are obtained, expanded 
outreach and design confirmation and 
refinement will be incorporated as part 
of the project implementation process.
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Greater impact and benefit of invest-
ments in park improvement projects.

 ` Improved access to park 
and recreation facilities. 

Lead: Public Works Department

Partners: Parks and Recreation 
Department, Oakland Parks 
and Recreation Foundation

Timeframe: Plan will be 
complete in early 2017

Funding: General Fund (funded);  
implementation of the projects could 
be funded through Measure KK 
(potential infrastructure bond). This 
Bond will ask voters in November 
2016 to invest as much as $600M in 
safer streets and sidewalks, improved 
libraries and parks, and upgrades to 
Oakland’s public safety buildings and 
fire stations—to renovate them, make 
them more environmentally sustainable 
and less costly to maintain.  In addition, 
the City can leverage the bond fund 
for potential capital improvement 
funds such as grants, foundations, 
donations, and state bonds.

Related goals: Promote safe and 
healthy neighborhoods; Use data to 
drive decisions; Maximize the impact 
of collective infrastructure investment.

Timeframe: Framework for the Green 
Infrastructure Plan prepared by 
June 2017.  Final Green Infrastruc-
ture Plan completed by 2019.

Funding: No existing dedicated 
source of funding for the planning, 
design, or implementation of Green 
Infrastructure. The City hopes to 
leverage existing resources by incorpo-
rating GI wherever possible with other 
planned capital improvement projects 
(streetscapes, facility renovations, park 
improvements) and will seek funding 
through grants and other sources. 

Related goals: Promote safe and 
healthy neighborhoods; Create more 
opportunities for collaborative govern-
ment; Maximize the value of collective 
infrastructure investment; Apply da-
ta-driven principles to decision-making

Challenges Addressed: 

 ` Developing a detailed project 

checklist: this would illustrate the 
entire typical project development 
cycle steps, including: funding 
sources/conditions, planning, 
design, construction and O&M; and 
including actions available that will 
act to ease integration of GI features 
into a range of project types; and

 ` Preparing design and implementation 

guidance for inclusion of green infra-
structure in transportation projects. 
May be incorporated as a chapter in 
Oakland’s Complete Streets Plan. 

As part of this process, the City will also 
seek funding to develop an Urban For-
estry Master Plan (UFMP), which would 
include an overall tree planting goal 
and annual target, to expand the urban 
forest and provide a variety of benefits, 
including improving air quality and car-
bon sequestration. As part of the UFMP, 
the City will look for opportunities 
to incorporate stormwater tree wells 
into tree planting areas to maximize 
the benefits that could be achieved 
through the planting of additional trees. 

The City will also explore using digital 
cost-benefit tools to demonstrate the 
triple bottom line (economic, social, 
and environmental) benefits of GI 
projects. For example, AutoCASE is 
useful for determining triple bottom 
line returns associated with infrastruc-
ture projects at sizes ranging from 
small (e.g., $500,000) to extremely 
large ($1 billion+). Including the 
valuation of sustainability benefits, in 
additional to more traditional financial 
returns, can help the City maximize 
the benefits of its investments in 
grey and green infrastructure for 
Oakland’s residents and businesses.
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Improves water quality of local 
creeks, lakes and the San Fran-
cisco Bay for safer recreation 
and healthier ecosystems.

 ` Reduces the risk of flooding and 

resultant disruption of services 
and damage to properties.

FLAGSHIP ACTION

GOAL: PROVIDE URBAN GREENING FOR NEIGHBORHOODS MOST IN NEED

DEVELOP A GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN 
TO IMPROVE SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, 
AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES

Description
Green infrastructure (GI) is an approach 
to stormwater management that 
protects, restores, or mimics the natural 
water cycle. In addition to improving 
San Francisco Bay water quality, GI pro-
vides co-benefits such as the creation/
protection of open space, reduced 
urban heat-island effect, improved air 
quality, and reduced flood risks. The 
City is developing a GI Plan to identify 
areas of opportunity and standards for 
inclusion of GI in public capital projects, 
such as streetscape renovations, parks 
projects, and parking lot retrofits. 
Opportunity areas for GI projects 
will be informed by multiple criteria, 
such as ability to meet regulatory 
requirements, cost efficiency, space 
availability, and equity considerations. 
Not only will the GI Plan ensure that 
the City complies with Clean Water Act 

requirements, it will also be a multi-fac-
eted guide for the City’s GI efforts. 

The City is also exploring the develop-
ment of an integrated project devel-
opment process as a part of this plan 
to help integrate GI into City plans and 
to enhance effective communication 
between departments, and vertically 
between the City Council, Office of 
the Mayor, Department of Transpor-
tation, and Planning and Engineering 
and Operations. The process would 
include the following actions:
 ` Creating a Resilience Delivery Team 

for design review: this would be a 
multi-discipline, cross-departmental 
group comprised of internal staff 
members (including planners, 
environmental, maintenance/
operations, etc.) that will review 
projects during their early develop-
ment phase for GI opportunities;

POWERS AGENCY FOR COMMUNITY 
CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM

Description
The City Council adopted legislation 
submitting Meausre KK (potential 
infrastructure bond) to the voters 
in November 2016. The legislation 
requires the City to consider four 
areas when choosing bond funded 
projects: 1) social and geographic 
equity, 2) how projects address the 
City’s core capital assets, 3) how 
projects maintain or decrease existing 
operation and maintenance costs, 
and 4) how projects address energy 
consumption, mobility, and resilience.

Additionally, as the City conducts 
its biennial Capital Improvement 
Plan, the City will explore 
establishing an integrated and 
holistic Resilience Delivery Team 
that builds City’s capacity to:
 ` Aim for equitable outcomes; 
 ` Leverage actions across a broad 

group of stakeholders;

 ` Consider cross-jurisdictional 

implications (i.e., intercity, 
regional, national, global);

 ` Consider impacts of multiple 
shocks and stresses identified 
through a broad risk and 
hazard assessment; and

 ` Aim for short, medium, and 
long-term triple bottom line 
benefits including economic, 
environmental, and social goals. 
Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Ensures equity in the capital 

improvement planning process.

 ` Integrates planning processes 

to achieve multiple benefits, 
including climate action and other 
resilience activities to help the City 
and its partners fulfill Oakland’s 
resilience goals more holistically 
in the short and long term.

Description
Alameda County, with input from its 
cities, is considering forming a Joint 
Powers Agency (JPA) to purchase 
and sell electricity to its residents 
and businesses as a Community 
Choice Aggregator (CCA), under the 
name East Bay Community Energy.  
This program would allow East Bay 
Community Energy to serve as the 
provider of electricity for the residents 
and businesses of each city and county 
that chooses to participate.  East Bay 
Community Energy would increase the 
amount of renewable energy provided 
to residents, lowering the carbon 
footprint of homes and businesses.

The CCA program is designed to create 
equity in delivering clean energy. To 
ensure that the community’s voice 
is reflected in the JPA, a Community 
Advisory Board has been established 
with its head serving as a non-voting 
member on the JPA Board of Directors. 
The CCA's feasibility study gave spe-
cific analysis of the impact of the CCA 
on creating local solar jobs. CCA’s have 
the ability to create local programs 
to support electric vehicles, energy 
efficiency upgrades, and other projects 
that replace aging infrastructure in 
Oakland.  By focusing on local clean 
energy projects, East Bay Commu-
nity Energy could also spur local job 
growth, with estimates between 160 
to 455 average annual jobs in the 
construction sector, and 752 to 1,617 
total average annual jobs in the County. 
The JPA further provides a priority 
for prevailing wage and union jobs.  

Benefits to Oakland Residents

INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS

EXPLORE INNOVATIVE FINANCING TOOLS FOR 
RESILIENCE PROJECTS, INCLUDING ECOBLOCKS

Description
Any innovative resilient project or 
initiative will require new thinking 
around how to leverage assets and 
financial tools to make it sustainable. 
Oakland’s resilience depends on the 
ability to reliably finance adaptation to 
a rapidly changing and complex future. 

As part of the EcoBlock project, 
the City is working with the State 
Treasurer’s Office, UC Berkeley, and 
other public finance experts to explore 
innovative business and financing 
models, such as eco-Community 
Facilities Districts or other types of 
financing districts. The purpose is 
to finance and scale deployment of 
clean and renewable technologies and 
seismic retrofits to adapt Oakland’s 
housing sector.  As part of the EcoBlock 
project, the City and project partners 
will develop new financing frameworks 
and tools to scale of EcoBlock 
throughout Oakland and beyond.
 

Benefits to Oakland Residents
 ` Enabling City staff to pursue tradi-
tional and nontraditional financing 
for climate action and other resilience 
activities will help the City and its 
partners fulfill Oakland’s resilience 
goals faster and more sustainably.

Developing Resilient Oakland has been a demanding 
two-year process due to the range of immediate 
and long-term economic, social and environmental 
challenges facing Oakland. The strategy development 
has involved the participation of many City staff 
across different departments, regional agencies, 
and members of local community organizations.

NOVEMBER 2015

OAKLAND

preliminary
resilience
assessment

The first phase of the process led to the 
Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA), 
which reviewed Oakland’s existing level 
of resilience and identified high-priority 
areas for future study as part of the 
second phase. The PRA development 
process involved a number of distinct 
exercises engaging a cross-departmental 
City working team to ensure the breadth 
and depth of current resilience efforts, 
as well as current risks faced by the City 
and community, were understood and 
documented. The process included a 
day-long event held in March 2015 to 
launch Resilient Oakland and the 2015 
Community Resilience Challenge led by 
Bay Localize, now Rooted in Resilience. 
This gave over 120 participants invited 
from local community groups, regional 
organizations and City departments 
the opportunity to hear from speakers 
on some of Oakland’s main resilience 
challenges, such as social and economic inequity (from Urban Strategies 
Council), food equity and access to basic needs (from the Food Policy 
Council), housing (from Causa Justa and City of Oakland) and sea level rise 
(from the Bay Conservation and Development Commission). Participants also 
took part in an interactive working session to identify, prioritize and then rate 
the most important factors that contribute to a more resilient Oakland.

A key output of the PRA was identifying five discovery areas around 
which the second phase of work was focused, with the goal of iden-
tifying actions that could help build a more resilient Oakland: 

 ` Prosperous Residents and Families: Promote the prosperity of residents and 

families through a more coordinated and comprehensive approach to increas-
ing access to good jobs, building wealth, and fostering economic development.

 ` Staying Rooted in Oakland: Identify what long-term residents of Oakland (es-
pecially the most vulnerable) need to be able to stay and what new residents 
need to be able to integrate in a way that preserves and reinforces community 
character.

 ` Living in Safe and Secure Neighborhoods: Identify innovative approaches for 

reducing violent crime and building community trust in law enforcement  
and justice.

 ` Benefiting from Public Infrastructure: Identify which public infrastructure 

projects will have the most impact on resilience and determine how they should 
be coordinated, sequenced, and financed.

 ` Recovering Quickly from Adversity: Identify what Oakland’s most vulnerable 

residents need to build their personal and community resilience.

Resilient OaklandResilient OaklandIntegral to the work within each of these discovery areas was to consider how 
Oakland should redefine how it engages with the community, works across 
City departments, and uses data in its everyday work. Consequently, creating 
the Resilient Oakland playbook involved a number of working group meetings 
around each of these discovery areas to define potential actions for inclusion. 
Key meetings included:

 ` A workshop bringing together landlords, tenants, City staff facilitated by frog 

design to identify opportunities for improving the Rent Adjustment Program

 ` Two meetings of a sea level rise working group to review current sea level rise 

activities and contribute to the development of a sea level rise road map to 
help Oakland become better prepared now for future sea level rise

 ` An interdepartmental meeting to consider current barriers and opportunities to 

integrating more green infrastructure into underserved areas of the city

 ` A meeting to evaluate progress to date and to update the Energy and Climate 

Action Plan

 ` A series of workshops by West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, 

Streetwyze, the City and Rebuild by Design to collaborate on how to develop a 
new mode of community engagement for the City of Oakland and its residents
 ` Meetings with IHS Markit and staff from City departments to review economic 

development and workforce development data analysis and strategies

 ` A meeting about data visualization with Oakland Police Department and Bayes 

Impact, as part of the City’s Startup in Residence Program

 ` Meetings with Greenlining and Urban Strategies Council to discuss financial 

inclusion data analysis and strategies 

 ` Two Oakland Economic Security & Wealth Building Working Group meetings 
to discuss how to deepen the City’s collective impact work in Oakland around 
economic resilience

 ` A series of roundtables as part of Oakland Thrives run by the Youth Ventures 

Joint Powers Authority and leaders from the public, business, and nonprofit 
sectors, the faith community, and Oakland neighborhoods to take a cross-sec-
tor collaborative approach to health, education, and wealth/income for the 
long term well-being of Oakland’s children, youth and their families

 ` An interdepartmental resilience visioning session facilitated by FSG underwrit-

ten by Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities

Additionally, the City of Oakland is grateful for the number of partners 
through the 100 Resilient Cities program and beyond which have pro-
vided over $750,000 worth of services (at no cost to the City) including 
IHS Markit, Rebuild by Design, Streetwyze, frog design, Impact Infra-
structure/Autodesk, Jump Associates, Vision Architecture, Data Eaters, 
AECOM and services still to be realized by Veolia and NOAA/HUD.

Resilient OaklandResilient OaklandAppendix C: Actions from Across the 
100 Resilient Cities Network 

Oakland Action

Develop principles for community 
engagement in Oakland

Educate Oakland youth about resilience 
issues and the future of Oakland through 
arts and storytelling

Support asset building for low-income 
parents and children through Oakland 
Promise College Savings Initiatives

Advance the health and wellbeing of 
Oakland youth and families

Launch Neighbors Helping Neighbors 
initiative to expand the reach of emergency

underserved neighborhoods

100RC Network Cities Working  

on Similar Actions

Byblos: Under its “A Peaceful City” strategic pillar, Byblos has several 
actions that will help open up communication channels across sectors 
in the city and work towards the achievement of “Goal A. Encourage 
Civic Engagement and Participation in Decision Making” through the 
creation of neighborhood committees to represent and advocate for 
communities and serve as a link to the municipal government – and 
the launch of a Youth Task Force (see pages 31-32 of their strategy).

Rotterdam: Rotterdam’s strategic pillar “Rotterdam Network—Truly 
Our City” highlights several initiatives that aim to activate citizens at 
the individual level; create strong connections among public, private, 
academic sectors; and enhance neighborhood-oriented governance 
(see pages 50-54 of their strategy).

New Orleans: NOLA has an action related to youth education 
through partnerships with the Louisiana Children’s Museum and other 
educational organizations (“Develop knowledge and capacity of 
emerging environmental stewards” on page 44 of their strategy).

Rio de Janeiro: Rio’s education initiative (Flagship Initiative #6A 
Educate the Youth for Resilience on  page 42) highlights the 
importance of educating future generations to advance resilience

Glasgow: Glasgow focuses much of its resilience strategy on the 
economic empowerment of residents and small businesses in the 
wake of the recession (and the long transition from an industrial 
economy). Under its third strategic pillar (Innovate to Support Fair 
Economic Growth), Glasgow pursues actions that match Oakland's 
actions under the goal Increase Economic Security (pages 65-72):
 ` Goal 3.E Continue to increase the skill levels 

of Glasgow's working age population

 ` Goal 3.B Through a 'New Approach to Enterprise' 

support new and existing businesses to grow (three 
actions related to enhanced city support of SMEs)

Medellin: Under its "Safe and Peaceful Medellin" pillar, the City will 
pursue a Strategy of Guarantees of Non-Repetition of Violence 
(GNR) with a large focus on youth (Action 2.A). They will also focus 
on building a youth citizen culture (Action 2.B) and center efforts on 
young women as well (Actions 2.C 2.D and 2.E).
Berkeley: Berkeley has a major goal to “Build a Connected and 
Prepared Community”—two actions in particular relate to community 
building efforts (see pages 22-23 of their strategy): Action 1B – 
Launch the Community Resilience Center Program. This program 
will provide disaster planning assistance and disaster supply ‘caches’ 
to local community-based organizations that are connecting with 
a range of communities in Berkeley (many of them vulnerable 
populations); Action 1C—Foster neighbor-to-neighbor connections 
to advance disaster readiness—The city is partnering with local 
community leaders in partnership with an NGO to identify local 
organizers at the neighborhood level (Neighborhood Disaster 
Preparedness Liaisons)

In the spirit of staying rooted and thriving 
in a vibrant and connected city, Resilient 
Oakland is also an invitation for all residents 
and organizations in the city to partner with 
City government and other community leaders 
to build Oakland’s resilience together. 

There is no single action we can take that solves all of Oakland’s challenges, but 
we can take coordinated, multi-disciplinary steps that address more than one 
challenge at once. As you review the Resilient Oakland Playbook, we invite you 
to identify opportunities for you to benefit from and contribute to the work. If 
you feel so inclined, you can give us direct feedback by filling out this letter.

I commit to...

Moving forward, the City will continue to contribute to and learn from the 
practice of resilience that is being advanced through the 100RC Network, of 
which Oakland is honored to be a part. The City will continue to foster partner-
ships with resilience leaders in the region, including the Cities of Berkeley and 
San Francisco and the multitude of local resilience leaders in our community.

I wish for...
