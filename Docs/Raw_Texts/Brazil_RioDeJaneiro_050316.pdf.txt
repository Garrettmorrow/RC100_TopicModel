resilient Rio strategy enables us to build expertise and have 
processes in place to continue developing a city ready to 
support our citizens and decrease future risks to all. 

As we look at immediate applications of resilience, one only 
has  to  look  at  our  exciting  upcoming  2016  Olympic  and 
Paralympic  Games.  We  are  already  defining  a  legacy  of 
resilience through important investments in city mobility, the 
creation of public spaces and opening new public venues. 

But  another  kind  of  legacy  can  be  incorporated,  adding 
to what already exists at the Center of Operations Rio: an 
operational  legacy.  The  Olympic  Games  involve  complex 
matters  related  to  mobility,  logistics,  and  security,  and 
require the extensive coordination and partnership of several 
governmental departments working in an integrated manner. 
All  our  efforts  feed  into  new  experiences  for  future  traffic 
operations, contingency plans and first responder activities 
to  address  crises  and  disasters.  All  that  we  are  going  to 
learn during the Games will not disappear after the closing 
ceremony, and it will work to make Rio more resilient.

In sum, the pursuit of resilience across the globe offers an 
extraordinary opportunity for Rio to support our peers based 
on what we have and continue to learn. We envision enabling 
cities to develop their own integrated resilience strategies to 
make them more capable of dealing with their shocks and 
chronic stresses and, above all, to prosper. I am therefore 
proud to share our Rio de Janeiro Resilience Strategy with all 
of you and thank all of our residents and visitors for helping 
us embrace resilience in our lives. 

Mayor Eduardo Paes

 
EDUARDO PAES, 

Mayor of the City of Rio de Janeiro

Rio de Janeiro is today a city with many ambitions. In 2016, 
we released Vision Rio 500, the result of an exciting and 
inclusive process that enabled thousands of Rio residents to 
share their aspirations for the future of our city. Our residents 
collectively  agree  that  Rio  should  be  a  gentle  city,  one 
that appreciates and pushes for creativity, one focused on 
celebrating and preserving its natural beauty, and one that is 
a source of opportunity and distinguished living for everyone. 

One of Vision Rio 500’s goals is to have Rio serve as a global 
reference  for  city  resilience.    Rio  de  Janeiro’s  Resilience 
Strategy is an important step towards achieving that goal, 
in that it defines priorities, guidelines and specific targets for 
developing a resilient model to share globally. 

In January 2015, the city released “Rio Resiliente: Diagnostic 
and Focus Areas,” which identified Rio’s main shocks and 
stresses. This critical work continued to be developed by the 
city  and  our  citizens,  thanks  in  large  part  to  the  energetic 
support of 100 Resilient Cities, pioneered by the Rockefeller 
Foundation; the culmination of which is the publication of this 
strategy book. Our journey to become a more resilient city 
was made possible by the combined guidance and effort of 
hundreds of thoughtful individuals within our community and 
experts  from  across  Rio  and  around  the  globe.  I  am  truly 
thankful to all of you and the plan you have helped us define. 

A city becomes more resilient when it is further prepared to 
face its challenges, be it social, environmental or economic. 
Resilience does not mean having an answer to every possible 
challenge, as nature continues to evolve. However, having a

But what resilience thinking allows us to do is to consider 
these challenges together in an integrated way. It demands 
that we ask ourselves how can we solve for the environmental 
challenges – around climate change, floods and heat islands 
– at the same time as we think about how to plan for and 
create an economically prosperous and inclusive city for all 
the citizens of Rio de Janeiro. It is then that we can begin to 
realize the full benefits of building urban resilience.  
 
Going forward, we could not be more excited to continue 
working with Rio de Janeiro to support the implementation of 
key initiatives and solutions for the city and its citizens. Though 
today is only the beginning, this strategy gives me confidence 
that Rio de Janeiro will continue to be a pioneer of resilience 
thinking, and a leader on the world stage in executing on its 
strategic priorities. Congratulations once again, and let the 
great work ahead begin!

Sincerely,
Michael Berkowitz
President, 100 Resilient Cities 

 
MICHAEL BERKOWITZ,

CEO of 100 Resilient Cities

100 Resilient Cities is honored to partner with the city of 
Rio de Janeiro to release its first ever resilience strategy, Rio 
Resiliente.  The resilience roadmap outlined in this strategy is 
the culmination of more than two years of research, analysis, 
outreach, and hard work by the entire Rio Resiliente team. 

First  and  foremost,  I  would  like  to  thank  Mayor  Eduardo 
Paes and congratulate him on the release of this strategy.  
None of this could have happened without his commitment 
to creating a better future for all of Rio de Janeiro, and his 
unwavering support for the resilience work. Additional thanks 
must be given to the entire Rio Resiliente team, including 
Chief Resilience Officer Pedro Junqueira, and Luciana Nery, 
Deputy  CRO. Their  dedication  to  producing  a  plan  of  this 
quality is already inspiring colleagues in cities all around the 
world.  This strategy establishes Rio de Janeiro as being on 
the cutting edge of innovative urban solutions and sends a 
strong message to cities globally to join the coming urban 
resilience revolution along with the 100 Resilient Cities network.  

The initiatives in Rio Resiliente not only apply a resilience 
lens to the short-term challenges of the city but also support 
long-term city planning. The resilience office research created 
inputs  and  insights  that  informed  Rio Vision  500  and  the 
Strategic Plan 2017-2020. The resilience strategy achieves 
an  important  alignment  of  these  three  city  documents. 

There is no doubt that the release of this strategy comes at a 
critical time for Rio.  The challenges and pressures of climate 
change,  urban  density,  social  cohesion  and  demands  on 
infrastructure, will continue to confront the city and its leadership.

“The resilience strategy of Rio de Janeiro proposes a set of guidelines and policies intended to bring the 
city and the metropolitan area the conditions to meet the challenges ahead. The ability to look to the future 
and recognize both the prospects and needs for the scientific, urban and social development was the most 
valuable experience that we in Rio Resiliente had in the sense of dreaming, proposing and organizing this 
set of urgent measures.” 

Pedro is Chief Resilience and Operations Officer of the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Head of the Center of Operations 
since  2013,  he  is  responsible  for  coordinating  integrated  actions  for  operational  agencies.  His  performance  aims  at 
reducing  the  government’s  response  time  to  any  incident  that  impacts  the  routine  of  the  population.  In  addition,  he 
manages the exploration and implementation of new technologies and the development of science for operations of the city. 
Graduated in business administration, Pedro has expertise in marketing and over 15 years of experience in Project and People 
Management. In the public sector, he worked in the dialogue between the public administration and the interests of civil society 
as a special advisor of the Municipal Departments of Transportation and Conservation and Public Services.

“Building resilience is to think of alternatives, it is to identify co-benefits in projects and public policies. The 
best way to do this is by integrating various points of view, always applying a resilience lens. Our thanks 
to the Resilience Champions and to the many collaborators who have supported us, it was because of their 
cooperation that the Resilience Strategy became more innovative and robust.”

Rio de Janeiro’s Resilience Strategy is an intermediary step 
between the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, which targets the 
near future, and Vision Rio 500, which involves aspirations 
for  the  longer  term.  The  Resilience  Strategy  establishes 
goals focused on resilience issues identified through the 100 
Resilient Cities Preliminary Risk Assessment, a process that 
involved more than 300 people between 2014 and 2016, 
resulting in the discovery of the main shocks and stresses 
affecting Rio. 

Rio’s  Resilience  Strategy  helps  define  new  projects  with 
longer-term results and clear benefits aimed at diminishing 
the  city’s  vulnerabilities  while  increasing  its  resilience. The 
strategic proposal recommends multiple programs including 
the  creation  of  the  Rio  Panel  of  Climate  Change;  the 
development of a disaster recovery plan for the metropolitan 
area; an agency for the promotion of circular economy; and 
a  course  on  Urban  Resilience,  to  reach  100,000  school 
children  until  2020.  All  the  projects  also  entirely  aligned 
with Vision 500 and aim at achieving the aspirations of the 
citizens of Rio. 

 The Resilience Strategy also features a selection of projects 
from the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, many of which were 
proposed by Rio Resiliente, the Rio de Janeiro’s Resilience 
Office,  including  LED  public  lighting,  individual  resilience 
indicators, an urban solar strategy, and an open, large-scale 
online course on urban resilience to train school teachers, 
public servants and the general population.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Resilience Strategy of the City of Rio 
de Janeiro aims to tackle the city’s main 
vulnerabilities and to make it more resilient. 
Rio’s Resilience Strategy is the culmination of 
a multi-year partnership of the City of Rio de 
Janeiro with 100 Resilient Cities, pioneered by 
the Rockefeller Foundation. 

Urban  resilience  is  defined  as  the  capacity  of  individuals, 
communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city 
to survive, adapt, and grow, no matter the chronic stresses and 
acute shocks they experience. 

Rio strives to become a global reference for resilience by 2035. 
This ambition is a core tenet of the Vision Rio 500, a pioneering 
citizen engagement project released in 2016 that focuses on 
the development of a long-term vision for the city. The creation 
of Vision Rio 500 provided Rio’s citizens, of all ages and social 
background, a unique opportunity to share their aspirations for 
what Rio de Janeiro should become by 2065, the city’s 500th 
anniversary.

Our vision for a more resilient Rio is based on 
developing a better relationship between the 
city and its water, infrastructure, and most 
importantly, its citizens. A resilient Rio is one 
that embraces its water, builds for the future 
and empowers its citizens. 

Thus, the City of Rio has developed the 
following goals based on its resilience vision:
#1: Better understand and mitigate impacts of 
severe weather and climate change 
#2: Mobilize Rio to be prepared to respond to 
extreme weather events and other shocks
#3: Cultivate green, cool, safe and flexible 
urban spaces
#4: Provide high quality, basic services to all 
citizens, through sustainable and resilient use of 
resources
#5: Promote an inclusive, diversified, circular 
and low-carbon economy
#6: Increase the overall resilience of citizens 
and promote social cohesion

top  priorities  for  public  action  and  capturing  stakeholder 
perceptions surrounding the perceived positive impacts of 
these actions for the city. 

In June 2015 the City of Rio began a discovery process 
to identify what citizens wished for the city over the next 
50 years. It was named Vision Rio 500 in reference to the 
city’s 500th anniversary in 2065 and involved thousands of 
citizens in various sessions, meetings, debates and online 
consultation.  Soon  after,  the  city  started  to  develop  its 
Strategic Plan 2017-2020, using an innovative approach 
of  ample  consultation  and  transversely  of  themes,  unlike 
the  former  ones.  Furthermore,  this  Strategic  Plan  is  fully 
aligned to Vision Rio 500, establishing goals, timeframes 
and budgets that, together, constitute a first step towards 
achieving the aspirations for the next 50 years. Those two 
plans,  for  2020  and  2065  were  released  in  March  1, 
2016  during  a  ceremony  at  the  Museum  of  Tomorrow, 
marking  a  new  phase  in  Rio  de  Janeiro’s  history;  one 
in  which  Rio’s  own  citizens  helped  develop  an  ambition 
of what they wanted in their city and how they intend to 
achieve that vision. 

The  Resilience  Strategy  points  to  initiatives  that 
constitute an intermediary step between Plan 2017-
2020, which targets the near future; and Vision Rio 
500,  which  is  about  longer-term  aspirations.  This 
Strategy also features a small selection of projects 
from the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, because of their 
relevance in increasing overall city resilience.

Introduction

Urban resilience is defined as the capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, businesses and systems within 
a city to survive, adapt, and grow, no matter the chronic 
stresses and acute shocks they experience. 

This publication outlines the Strategy of Resilience of the 
City of Rio de Janeiro. It is the result of more than two years 
of work and the start of a new phase: the implementation of 
projects with clear benefits to increase  the city’s resilience 
from an integrated point of view, and fully aligned to the 
city’s most recent strategy documents: the Strategic Plan 
2017-2020 and Vision Rio 500. 

The Resilience Strategy is being released in a key moment 
of  the  city’s  transformation:  451  years  of  history,  the 
2016  Olympic  and  Paralympic  Games,  and  a  vision  for 
the next 50 years, named Vision Rio 500. The Resilience 
Strategy was developed from 2014 through 2016 by the 
City of Rio de Janeiro, with the direct participation of 300 
people, and more than 800 people engaged, from various 
backgrounds,  with  the  support  of  100  Resilient  Cities1, 
pioneered  by  the  Rockefeller  Foundation,  which  aims  to 
support resilience in cities around the world. 

of  city  challenges.  Furthermore,  the  COR  has  access  to 
a multitude of data regarding the daily routine of the city 
and  many  tools  for  the  mobilization  of  resources  and 
communication  with  society.  The  COR  therefore  fosters 
an  ideal  environment  for  long-term  urban  planning  that 
incorporates the management of recurrent city risks. 

The development of the Resilience Strategy involved two 
phases. The first identified the main risks to city resilience, 
its vulnerabilities. The end of this first phase was marked by 
the January 2015 release of “Rio Resilient: Diagnostic and 
Focus Areas”, a book that included a preface by the former 
Vice-President of the United States, Al Gore. This document 
identifies Rio’s main shocks and chronic stresses, features 
a classification of city’s risks and an analysis of city projects 
related to resilience and what they represent in terms of 
prevention,  monitoring,  mobilization,  communication  and 
constant learning. 

The development of the Resilience Strategy is led by Rio 
Resiliente, a multidisciplinary team linked to the Center of 
Operations Rio (COR). The incorporation of the resilience 
theme by the COR took place primarily due to its integrative 
and  horizontal  nature,  which  favors  transversal  analyses

Once the city’s resilience priorities were mapped, the city 
began the second phase of the 100 Resilient Cities program 
aimed at defining a core resilience strategy. Members of 
the Rio Resiliente team consulted multiple expert working 
groups  throughout  2015,  with  the  goals  of  establishing

Shocks and 
Chronic 
Stresses of Rio

During 2014 through 2015, Rio Resiliente involved more 
than 300 people in a series of workshops and interviews 
focused on identifying the city’s main threats to resilience. 
With the support of the 100 Resilient Cities’ methodology, 
public  managers,  service  company  representatives  (e.g. 
trash collection, electricity and water utilities), academics, 
community  leaders  and  other  members  of  civil  society 
were interviewed. 

The  Rio  Resiliente  team  assessed  resilience  across 
socioeconomic,  behavioral,  management  and  climate 
issues. The  team’s  findings  informed  the  identification  of 
Rio’s key shocks and stresses: 

I - INTENSE RAINS 
Strong  rains  cause  flooding  and  landslides,  damage 
buildings, provoke economic losses and spread diseases 
through  contamination  of  sewage  and  solid  waste  in  the 
rainwater, such as leptospirosis and diarrhea. They can also 
prompt energy black-outs, lower public safety, toppling of 
trees and traffic accidents. 

In  2010,  between  April  6  and  7,  13  inches  of  rain  in 
24  hours  caused  the  death  of  66  people,  mostly  due 
to  landslides.  Climate  models  indicate  that  rains  in  the 
Southeast of Brazil might become less frequent, but that 
rainfall  can  be  concentrated  in  a  shorter  period  of  time, 
which increases potential to cause damages. 

II - STRONG WINDS 
The strongest winds registered in Rio de Janeiro reach 
the  speed  of  100Km/h.  Many  climate  models  indicate 
the  possibility  of  increase  in  frequency  and  intensity  of 

winds in Brazil. In Rio, strong winds can cause damage 
to rooftops, power lines and trees, with the blockage of 
streets, closure of bridges, paralysation of waterways and 
threaten human lives. 

III - HEAT ISLANDS AND HEAT WAVES 
Heat waves are extreme climate events with high mortality 
potential.  Heat  waves  occur  when  temperatures  remain 
high for multiple days (above the 98th percentile in Rio’s 
case). With climate change, it is estimated that heat waves 
will  become  even  more  extreme.  Besides  death,  heat 
waves generate thermal discomfort, increase in respiratory 
and  cardiovascular  diseases,  increase  in  stress  and  loss 
of  productivity,  mainly  when  people  work  under  sun 
exposure. High temperature also causes an increase in the 
consumption  of  electric  energy,  with  possibility  of  black-
outs  due  to  excessive  demand;  and  also  more  dry  days 
which, increase the chance of fires in slopes. 

Heat islands happen in areas which, due to geography and 
urbanization patterns, tend to accumulate more hot air in 
comparison to surrounding areas. Rio has had a significant 
increase  in  its  heat  islands  since  1980.  Examples  from 
around the world indicate that neighborhoods, which are 
exceedingly  hot  have  lower  economic  development  and 
quality of life. 

IV - SEA LEVEL RISE
A study developed in 2010 indicates that if the sea level 
rises by half a meter, then approximately 30 km2 of Rio de 
Janeiro would be at risk of being submerged by sea water2. 
For  example,  one  at-risk  area  surrounds  the  Baixada  de 
Jacarepaguá lake system, whose water-covered area can

expand and reach inhabited districts including Itanhangá, 
Rio  das  Pedras,  Vargem  Pequena  and  Vargem  Grande, 
which are already susceptible to storm surges. 

The rise in the average level and reach of storm surges 
may also affect coastal ecosystems, cause the salinization 
of  potable  water,  damage  streets  infrastructure,  and 
overburden rainwater retention drainage system, increasing 
the number of floods. Rio de Janeiro’s identity is closely 
intertwined with its beaches. Sea level rise poses a serious 
threat to Rio’s iconic beaches and their key economic pull 
from tourism. 

Sea  level  rise  can  also  affect  neighboring  cities  located 
around the Guanabara Bay, with negative consequences to 
the economy, mobility and population health.

V - EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS 
The mosquito Aedes aegypti, endemic in Rio since 1982, 
is a vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika. The presence 
of these mosquitoes may increase through climate change-
driven  outcomes  such  as  increase  in  urban  heat  islands 
that accelerate reproduction and extend the months that 
reproduction  occurs  throughout  the  year.  Prevention 
systems  and  victim  epidemic  treatment  are  applied 
irregularly in the metropolitan region, which constitutes a 
vulnerability for Rio.

VI - DROUGHTS 
Droughts driven by insufficient rain throughout the southeastern 
regions of Brazil after the summer of 2011 caused considerable 
water scarcity for citizens. Additionally, given Brazil’s reliance on 
hydroelectric power, the lack of water caused electricity prices 
to increase, making it less affordable for the majority of users.

In  general,  the  challenges  to  be  tackled  regarding  urban 
infrastructure  are  related  to  their  predicted  asset  life  time, 
such as the adequate service time and related maintenance 
for bridges, overpasses, antennas, canopies, rooftops, seaside 
kiosks, windows, and others. 

IX  -  AGGLOMERATION  OF  PEOPLE  WITH  IMPACT 
IN NORMALCY
The  presence  of  a  large  number  of  people  in  the  same 
place can pose risks to those involved and take a city out of 
its normality. Rio’s street Carnival parades move millions of 
people and events such as New Year’s Eve gather around 
2  million  people  to  watch  the  fireworks  in  Copacabana. 
Music festivals, the World Cup and the Olympic Games also 
affect  the  normal  movements  of  the  city.  Besides  these, 
some events happen with little or no previous warning, like 
demonstrations  and  protests.  Public  manifestations  are  a 
valid tool for democracy, whose main purpose is to show 
the dissatisfaction of segments and groups in society. More 
specifically,  the  agglomeration  of  people,  depending  on 
how it develops, may cause the following impacts: 

- Obstruction of streets without previous warning, resulting 
in traffic jams.
- Attacks and depredation of the private and public property 
in case of extreme violence 
- Sound pollution and disturbance of resident living
-  Interruption  of  essential  services,  due  to  strikes  or 
demonstrations
- Decrease in the perception of personal safety.

depend on water supplied from the River Guandu Treatment 
Station  located  outside  the  city  limits  in  Nova  Iguaçu.  This 
constitutes a vulnerability, as Rio is heavily dependent on a sole 
source of water, with limited alternatives actively used to date. 

VII - SATURATION OF THE ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE 
Between 2004 and 2014, one million new vehicles were 
added  to  the  existing  fleet  of  1.5  million  cars3.  Despite 
recent gains in average city commuting times following the 
implementation of Bus Rapid Transit, Bus Rapid System and 
better traffic operations, traffic jams are still a major chronic 
stress of the city, causing the following negative impacts:
- Worsened air quality, affecting human health, such as asthma
-  Increased  sound  pollution  and  diminishing “walkability” 
in the city
- Increased traffic accidents with fatalities 
- Increased greenhouse gas emissions
- Decreased productivity and increased economic losses to 
companies and citizens
- Increased transit delays for emergency vehicles
-  Decreased  quality  of  life,  because  increased  commuting 
diminishes free time for leisure, study and family.

VIII - ACCIDENTS WITH URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE 
In  1900,  Rio  had  little  more  than  800,000  inhabitants;  in 
1950,  2,377,451;  and  in  2015,  the  Brazilian  Institute  for 
Statistics and Geography estimates Rio is home to more than 
6,500,000  residents.  This  population  growth  has  occurred 
without  concurrent  expansions  and  modernizations  of  urban 
infrastructure,  causing  increases  in  infrastructure-associated 
accidents. The main consequences of accidents in the urban 
infrastructure are: 
- Increases in traffic delays due to accidents with trains, buses 
and subways 
- Gas explosions and leaks
-  Regular  and  long-term  power  outages  associated  with 
underground  electric  reactor  explosions  and/or  damage  to 
aerial power lines
- Water supply disruption due to increased bursting of high-
pressure water and sewage pipes

X - CRIMINAL ACTS IN URBAN SPACES 
The actsion of criminal groups can affect the resilience of 
the city in many ways, causing abrupt shocks, like crime 
waves;  but  also  chronic  stresses,  like  increasing  the 
sensation of insecurity, which affects negatively real estate 
prices, tourism and the psychological health of citizens. The 
main consequences are:

- Depredation and vandalism
- Difficulty in the provision of public services and resulting 
offer of clandestine services
- Threats to the civil society, like murders, thefts, abuses, 
etc.
- Depreciation of property values and economic depression. 

Safety and public order are key elements to the resilience 
of a city, because they are linked directly to the preservation 
of life, property and the physical and psychological well-
being of citizens. 

XI - INSUFFICIENT SANITATION4 
In  the  city  of  Rio,  57%  of  people  have  access  to  the 
complete  cycle  of  basic  sanitation.  The  unequal  access 
to  sanitation  causes  various  impacts  in  public  health, 
increasing  the  number  of  infectious  diseases,  including 
those transmitted by Aedes aegypti, and infant mortality.

Insufficient sanitation causes environmental and economic 
degradation of the areas surrounding all types of bodies of 
water, reaching mainly the ecosystems of the Guanabara 
and Sepetiba bays, lakes, rivers and beaches, with various 
negative impacts to human health, tourism and the city’s 
branding. The metropolitan governance for sanitation is in 
its  early  stages,  similar  to  infrastructural  investments  and 
the connections of the sewage lines to treatment stations. 
Illegal sewer plumbing pollutes nascent rivers that could be 
utilized for water consumption. It also mixes with the city’s 
rainwater  system,  lowering  the  city’s  capacity  to  absorb 
intense rains, resulting in flooding in case of heavy rains.   

4. This last item, Insufficient Sanitation, was mapped as important to the resilience of the city after 
consultation with many stakeholders during the development of the Second Phase of the project, 
and for this reason it is not featured in the book “Rio Resiliente: Diagnostic and Focus Area”.

Context of 
the City

The city of Rio de Janeiro was founded 451 years ago, 
and  today  it  is  the  second  largest  city  in  Brazil  in  terms 
of  population  and  GDP.  It  is  a  large  city  with  6,5  million 
people, in a metropolitan area with more than 10 million 
inhabitants. 

The city developed between the sea and the mountains. It 
is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the Guanabara Bay 
and the Sepetiba Bay and  hosts three urban forests, the 
Forest of Tijuca, the Pedra Branca Massif and the Geriçinó 
Massif. Together, they form a unique scenery, which makes 
Rio famous worldwide for its natural beauty. It is also known 
as  the Wonderful  City  and  is  the  main  tourist  destiny  in 
Brazil, visited by two million international tourists every year. 

Beyond the natural wealth, politics and culture have always 
been present in the city. Capital of Brazil between 1763 
and  1960,  Rio  de  Janeiro  harbored  many  important 
political  and  historical  events,  and  recently  hosted  major 
events,  such  as  the World  Cup  in  2014  and,  soon,  the 
Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016.  

The  economy  of  the  city  is  mainly  based  on  services  - 
86%.  The  rest  is  largely  comprised  by  the  industrial 
sector, with intense participation of Brazilian multinationals 
like  Petrobras  and Vale,  in  the  fields  of  oil  and  minerals, 
respectively. Only a small portion is related to agriculture 
- less than 1%. 

The  Human  Development  Index  of  the  city,  in  2010,  is 
0.799,  and  it  varies  from  a  high  to  0.970  in  the  most 
prosperous neighborhood, to 0.700 in the poorest. This 
disparity in development can also be perceived in the map

Rio’s  commitment  towards  resilience  is  demonstrated 
through  many  initiatives,  such  as  the  creation  of  the 
Center  of  Operations  Rio,  the  acquisition  of  a  weather 
radar,  heavy  investments  on  slope  contention  and  flood 
control, installation of early warning systems in favelas and 
evacuation drills in areas prone to landslides. In 2014 the 
city created Rio Resiliente, a strategic office that acts as 
an  interlocutor  between  other  city  departments,  private 
sector, NGOs and international institutions, next to planning 
and  developing  its  own  projects  aimed  at  increasing  the 
resilience of Rio. 

The map shows the development level across the administrative regions of the City of Rio de Janeiro. Based on the Social Progress Index of Rio de Janeiro, the results 
compound 36 variables forming 12 parameters. It includes nutrition, primary medical care, access to water and housing, personal safety, basic and higher education, 
health and well-being, freedom and civil rights, tolerance and social inclusion. The regions in dark green have the best overall results, according to the Index, while those 
in red feature the worst conditions. Source: Instituto Pereira Passos (IPP), April 2016.

Vision Rio  
500 and 
Strategic Plan 
2017- 2020

In June 2015 the city of Rio started an ample process of public consultation for the formulation of a vision for the next 
50 years, named Vision Rio 500, because in 2015 Rio celebrated the 450o anniversary of its foundation. The objective 
was to engage the population and answer the following question: What Do We Want for the Future of our City? 

More than one million people dreamed, liked, shared and

Values
of Rio 
Resiliente

CONNECT 
We recognize that excellent practices and initiatives exist in the public, private and academic 
sectors and in the civil society, and that connections between these parties can increase the 
resilience  of  our  City  significantly.  Rio  Resiliente  holds  as  a  main  principle  the  connection 
between  parties  with  common  objectives  in  order  to  profit  more  from  the  co-benefits  of 
collaboration.  

COLLABORATE
Collaboration is at the core of resilience projects. Collaboration means even more success for 
all parties, and therefore we promote and foster with great care our strategic relationships 
within the City Hall, with civil society, NGOs and the private sector, always looking to openly 
share information, ideas and bring people together in our projects and initiatives.

CO-BENEFITS
This is our raison d’être, as the transversal analysis of impacts and identification of co-benefits 
can add quality to already existing projects and make a difference in evaluating and comparing 
business cases. By looking through the resilience lens, Rio Resiliente can help the city tackle 
more challenges with the same initiative, the result of ample and intersectorial analyses of 
impacts.

RESILIENCE CHAMPION

Sérgio  Besserman  is  president  of  the  Municipal  Institute  Pereira  Passos  and  the  Sustainable 
Development Technical Chamber of the City of Rio de Janeiro. He is a Professor of Economics and Environmental 
Engineering at PUC-RJ. He is advisor to various organizations such as Fundação Roberto Marinho, WWF, 
CI-Brazil, ITDP, Funbio, Bolsa Verde, and Rio Clima. He writes regularly for the newspaper O Globo. He was 
planning director of BNDES between 1996 and 1999 and president of the Brazilian Institute of Geography 
and Statistics. One of the pioneers on the theme resilience in Brazil, he is part of the Steering Committee of Rio 
Resiliente since its inception in 2014.

IDENTIFIED SHOCKS AND CHRONIC STRESSES 
Heavy rains, strong winds, waves and heat islands, sea level rising, epidemics and pandemics, prolonged drought, saturation 
of road infrastructure, accidents with urban infrastructure, overcrowding impacting normality, insufficient sanitation.

FOCUS AREAS
Climate Change, Socioeconomic Resilience, Resilient Behavior, and Resilient Management. 

The City Resilience Framework
Developed by Arup with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, The City Resilience Framework (CRF) provides a lens to 
understand the complexity of cities and the drivers that contribute to their resilience, and a common language that enables 
cities to share knowledge and experiences. Rio Resiliente uses this tool to evaluate the scope and quality of the City’s 
initiatives and projects. 

The CRF is built on four essential dimensions of urban resilience: Health & Wellbeing; Economy & Society; Infrastructure & 
Environment; and Leadership & Strategy.

Resilience 
Challenges

A. RELATIONSHIP OF THE CITY WITH WATER 

“Rio” means “river”, and Rio de Janeiro is all about water: it is in the name, in the images that attract visitors and in the self-
identity  of  Cariocas.  However,  mismanagement,  wasteful  practices,  over-reliance  on  a  single  source  of  potable  water  and 
disorganized urbanization also mean that water constitutes a major challenge to the resilience of Rio. 
Water seems to be abundant in the lakes, mountains, beaches and in the thousands of rivers that cross the city. But, as the 
Southeast of Brazil experienced from 2011 onwards, water scarcity is a real threat, due to the increased irregularity of rain 
patterns in the region, which unpredictably intersperse intense rainfall with longer periods of drought.
The production of energy from water also disrupts the flow of the river and lowers the amount of water available to the Guandu 
system, which supplies water to 92% of the people living in Rio and is located in the neighboring city of Nova Iguaçu. This 
over-reliance on a single source of water makes the city fragile to any irregularity of supply or upstream disturbances not in the 
hands the Rio municipality.  
Polluted bodies of water affect the integrity of ecosystems and contribute to an array of health problems, ranging from vector-
borne diseases to increased infant mortality. Insufficient sanitation, poor waste management, industrial pollutants and lack of 
metropolitan governance translate into increased pollution of the Guanabara Bay and the river systems of the West Zone, 
among other affected areas. The pollution of beaches also negatively affects the image of the city and the economic potential 
of the coastal area. 
The strong rains during summer cause flooding and landslides in the city, causing significant economic losses and fatalities, 
mainly in the vulnerable communities in the mountain slopes. In April of 2010, 66 people died in the favelas after record-
breaking storm, and the city’s infrastructure was heavily damaged. 
The global tendency to sea level rise, estimated to range from 28 to 98cm in 2100, according to IPCC 2013, may cause the 
salinization of rivers and aquifers, thus reducing availability of water for industries and for human consumption.

Rio de Janeiro, like many cities, has a complicated ecosystem of natural and built environments that require an integrated 
resilience strategy. The greatest challenges come from three primary areas - water, infrastructure, and social vulnerability. Water 
can be both abundant or scarce, life provider or disease vector, and thus needs to be better managed. Infrastructure must be 
permanently and sustainably improved to meet the needs, protections and expectations of citizens. Social vulnerability must 
be reduced, because citizens with insufficient access to basic services are the most exposed and take longer to recover from 
shocks and chronic stresses. Climate change and economic instability are multipliers that can worsen or exacerbate these 
challenges.

B. RELATIONSHIP OF THE CITY WITH ITS INFRASTRUCTURE 

C. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EACH CITIZEN WITH THE CITY

The city of Rio was founded 450 years ago in a beautiful and yet challenging natural environment. There was an intense 
population growth in the 20th century, and now 6.8 million people must live and thrive in this expanding and densifying urban 
space. 
Due to fast and disorganized growth, urban spaces are often poorly equipped to deal with the needs of citizens. Some areas 
of the city lack adequate access to basic services, like sanitation and legal access to water and energy. Macro drainage of 
rainwater is often insufficient, thus contributing to flooding. The expansion of the city towards the West put pressure on the 
creation of new infrastructure for the new demands. In favelas, many houses were built in areas prone to landslides, often without 
proper design and materials, and investments on social housing has been insufficient to reach demand. 
The quality of the urban spaces varies within the city, with many neighborhoods lacking green and recreational areas, artistic 
expressions and enough businesses to employ residents and diminish need for commuting for employment. 
Poor sanitation and inadequate disposal of solid waste in the city and metropolitan area are the greatest contributors to water 
pollution.
The coverage of primary health care has increased in the past years, but still must be expanded to reach even more people. 
As the number of cars increase and people live farther away from jobs, mobility has become less efficient and traffic is often 
congested. The investments in mobility tend to be reactive and often do not anticipate future needs. 
Strong winds are acute shocks that cause many disruptions in the city, such as damaged power lines, toppled trees and various 
other accidents. 
Energy, water and waste are resources whose potential is underutilized. The city does not produce its own energy, despite the 
immense potential for solar energy production. Water is wasted as it flows along outdated infrastructure and is spent unwisely5. 
Solid waste, which carries the potential to be reused, recycled and transformed, is mostly buried in landfills, not generating value 
and causing negative environmental impact. 
The  sea level rise and the intensification of storm surges put at risk the coastal infrastructure and the income from tourism. 
Even though the city has made significant advances in mobilization for shocks and disasters with the implementation of the 
Center of Operations, mobilization of resources at city and metropolitan levels should be better integrated, so that the region is 
ready to respond adequately to recurrent or rare shocks.

Social inequality means that there are  different cities for different citizens. Favelas and the “formal” city are in close proximity 
throughout Rio de Janeiro, and yet the experience of living in one or the other varies immensely. The provision of services 
and economic opportunities are unequal, with insufficient access to sanitation, transportation, health services, culture, sports, 
education and employment. 
Citizens must be aware of how their behavior impacts their everyday life in the city. The conscientious use of water and energy 
not only conserves natural resources, but also means lower bills and taxes, and guarantees safer and steadier supply. The proper 
disposal of solid waste lowers the risk of flooding due to clogged pipes. Protecting trees not only helps carbon sequestration 
and biodiversity but, more tangibly to citizens, reduces temperature and air and noise pollution while improving access to green 
space. Using public instead of private transportation reduces air pollution, carbon emissions and diminishes traffic congestions. 
To support the reuse and recycling of materials is to lower demand on natural resources and create a market for composting 
and solid waste, both of which have immense potential for job creation, as is the case in cities worldwide. 
Criminality lowers trust in the public spaces, damages social cohesion and cause psychological and economic losses to citizens. 
It is recognized around the world that the most socially vulnerable populations are the ones who suffer the most impact from 
natural disasters and economic downturns. They also take longer to recover and rebound from shocks. Efforts to make the city 
more resilient, therefore, must acknowledge the increased vulnerability of those with little economic resources or social safety 
nets and act upon it with special attention.  
Few schools in the city, public or private, teach children resilience to the shocks and stresses of the city, what impacts of climate 
change they may experience or what constitutes sustainable consumption of resources. Consequently, few citizens know how 
to act in the course of a disaster and what risks they face in their neighborhoods and everyday lives, let alone how to prevent 
and prepare for those. 
Climate change is increasing the intensity and number of extreme weather events and also destabilizing provision of resources 
like water, energy and food. Brazilians cannot anymore count on the abundance of resources, and the risk of scarcity must be 
incorporated in public policies and individual behavior. Those risks, for their potential impacts, cannot be addressed separately 
by different spheres of government, city departments or discrete projects. Citizens and city administration must collaborate to 
prevent and monitor those risks, to incorporate new knowledge and, moreover, to find opportunities to thrive despite challenges 
posed by shocks and chronic stresses.

Urban heat islands are worsening due to increasing urbanization and warming climate. As demonstrated in cities 
worldwide, increased temperatures pose a threat to human health, reduce productivity, cause thermal stress and 
reduce walkability in a city.

pipes, damaging city infrastructure.  (Source: “O Rio do Amanhã, Vision 500 and Strategic Plan 2017-2020”, 2016.)

Resilience 
Vision

Our vision of a resilient Rio is more than just a city that protects itself and its Cariocas from a 
wide range of shocks and stresses - it is a city that supports a fulfilling life for citizens of all 
ages and backgrounds in the coming decades by embracing our social, environmental and 
infrastructure issues head on.  We see a future Rio that is safe, beautiful and gentle, as well as 
economically prosperous and just. In order to tackle our challenges, we must make all aspects 
of the city and our people more resilient, specifically we will…

A. EMBRACE OUR WATER 
water in the rivers, lakes and beaches will be clean, fostering vibrant tourism and economic 
activities; it will be managed and consumed conscientiously and there will be potable water for 
the metropolitan region at all times.  

B. BUILD FOR OUR FUTURE 
the urban spaces will be safe, green, climate-smart and will promote the well-being of citizens; 
no Carioca will live in a high-risk area; and housing and high-quality basic services, especially 
sanitation, will be available for all. 

C. EMPOWER OUR PEOPLE 
Cariocas  will  have  plenty  of  jobs  within  a  diversified,  inclusive,  low-carbon  and  circular 
economy; they will participate actively in the decisions that affect them; and will be ready to 
learn, prevent, mobilize and grow from the shocks and stresses that affect the city and the 
planet.

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE:
Set up a Climate Change Panel for the city of Rio de Janeiro 
involving experts from various scientific fields to study climate 
trends with the Panel of Climate Change (IPCC 2013) and 
future iterations as basis. This panel, pioneer in Latin America, 
is  inspired  by  a  similar  initiative  in  New York  City,  and  its 
mission  will  be  to  investigate,  publish  and  communicate 
results of climate change research and its impacts on the 
city of Rio, as well as provide support for decision-making 
on urban planning and inform other fields of knowledge and 
the civil society. 

The  Panel  aims  to  incorporate  state  of  the  art  scientific 
knowledge on climate, at global and national levels, in order 
to indicate possible climate change scenarios and its impacts 
specifically  to  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  its  metropolitan  region. 
The reports released should foster scientific research on the 
effects of climate change at city level and foster conversation 
on the related environmental, social and economic aspects. 

Furthermore, the Panel encourages a connection between 
climate change and other disciplines, with focus on transversal 
analyses of impacts, for example: a) analysis of how extreme 
temperatures impact vector-borne diseases such as Dengue, 
Chikungunya  and  Zika,  b)  economic  valuation  of  various 
scenario-based  impacts  of  sea  level  rise.  The  knowledge 
generated will support public policies for the mitigation and 
adaptation of climate change in Rio, specifically those related 
to strong rains and winds, sea level rise, heat islands and 
waves, droughts and epidemics.  

The initiative to create a Panel on Climate Change for Rio 
was proposed by Rio Resiliente and the Mayor’s Office and 
is in its planning stage.

FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE #1.B:  

Implement portfolio of climate mitigation and adaptation 

for its main threats; Aspiration (III.2.a): No family in the city 
will live in risk areas. 

STRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020 
Initiative  3.12  –  Expected  Results:  Better  knowledge 
about  GEE  emissions,  climate  interactions  and  air  quality, 
for  mitigation,  disaster  prevention,  health  policies  and 
increased quality of life. Initiative 4.10 – Urban renewal in 
neighborhoods with precarious or nonexistent infrastructure, 
focusing on regions AP 3 and AP 5. Initiative 4.11 – Urban 
planning of the Vargens neighborhood. 

VALUE AND CO-BENEFITS 
Promotion of wider utility and durability of urban infrastructure, 
planning  for  areas  vulnerable  to  climate  change,  including 
the  neighborhood  of Vargens  and  its  susceptibility  to  sea 
level rise; capacity to attract more investments and generate 
better  quality  of  life;  less  GHG  emissions;  investment  for 
crisis and disasters, especially those related to climate risks.

INDICATORS
Projects  developed;  projects  implemented;  attraction  of 
private national and international investments; lower carbon 
emissions; preservation of human life.

FOCAL POINTS 
Rio  Resiliente  and  departments  for  urban  planning  and 
finance.

POTENTIAL PARTNERS 
C40, World Bank, Rio de Janeiro Panel on Climate Change, 
departments of conservation, environment, private sector and 
universities.

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
Develop a portfolio of projects for mitigation and reduction 
of GHG emissions, and also adaptation projects to reduce 
the existing and future effects of climate change, suited for 
public, private and international financing. This portfolio must 
incorporate  the  conclusions  related  to  climate  in  the  local 
level, as informed by the Rio de Janeiro Panel on Climate 
Change (initiative 1A).

Having  as  a  basis  the  citywide  GHG  emission  inventories 
and the Climate Change Adaptation Municipal Plan, led by 
the  Secretary  of  Environment,  the  city  of  Rio  will  develop 
a portfolio of actionable projects focused on targeting the 
greatest  emitters,  with  the  establishment  of  goals,  and 
fostering  better  management  of  resources  though  the 
promotion  of  a  circular  economy  (initiatives  5A  and  5B). 
The plan for mitigation and reduction of GHG emissions will 
involve  projects  related  to  renewable  energy,  low-carbon 
economy and sectors, and transportation. 

The Portfolio of Climate Mitigation and Adaptation will aim to 
provide guidelines for urban interventions of Rio de Janeiro, 
so  that  urban  planning,  public  works  and  maintenance 
internalize  concepts  and  practices  that  make  Rio  more 
resilient to climate change. Those projects will be related to 
rainfall  harvesting,  permeable  paving,  tree  planting,  green 
roofs,  among  others  (see  Goal  #3, “Cultivate  green,  cool, 
safe and flexible urban spaces”), and must be formulated 
already considering available and innovative financial options. 

The  portfolio’s  objective  it  to  foster  the  development  of 
projects to tackle the vulnerabilities of the city to strong rains 
and winds, heat islands and waves, sea level rise, epidemics 
and accidents with urban infrastructure. 

The first stages for the implementation of a portfolio of climate 
mitigation  and  adaptation  is  featured  in  the  Strategic  Plan 
2017-2020 and Rio Resiliente supports its development on 
an amplified scope.

population of Rio”.

GOAL #1 Better understand and mitigate impacts of severe weather and climate change

INITIATIVE #1.C:

Monitor Climate Trends and Impacts

ESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE 
Monitor  and  support  research  on  climate  trends  and 
impacts, analyzing socioeconomic data in order to generate 
crosscutting  analyses  of  costs  and  benefits  of  projects 
and  public  policies  for  climate. The  risk  modelling  will  be 
developed with the support of georeferenced risk mapping 
(initiative 1D), involving shocks and chronic stresses such as 
strong rains and winds, heat islands, air quality, flooding and 
landslides, high tides and storm surges, and epidemics.
 
The aim of this initiative is to establish permanent, integrated 
and multidisciplinary climate monitoring, with the involvement 
of  city  departments,  other  spheres  of  government,  NGOs 
and  citizens.  To  this  continuous  and  evolving  monitoring, 
other analyses will be added, for example, such as the social 
and economic impacts of sea level rise in the next decades. 
This initiative also entails the monitoring of the winds in the 
city, for the development of historical data and support for 
academic  research  on  the  theme,  adding  to  the  existing 
knowledge about rains. Finally, this project supports research 
on the interactions of heat waves and heat islands with the 
air quality of Rio. 

Furthermore, the monitoring of climate trends and impacts 
involves  the  active  participation  of  citizens,  through  the 
voluntary and collaborative collection of climate data with the 
use of simple homemade sensors, thus supporting actions 
of Citizen Science. 

This initiative, including the monitoring and Citizen Science, 
was  proposed  by  Rio  Resiliente  and  incorporated  by  the 
Strategic  Plan  2017-2020.  Itis  currently  partly  being 
implemented,  as  the  Center  of  Operations  is  stating  to 
monitor heat waves and incorporate wind data already, and 
partly in the planning phase, for example for the sea level 
rise studies. 

VISION RIO 500 
Aspiration (III.2.b): The City will be prepared and adapted to 

face  climate  change  and  its  impacts,  having  mapped  and 
planned for its main threats; Aspiration (III.2.a): No family in

learn  more  about  heat  waves,  winds  and  droughts,  and  a 
predictive system to determine the effects of meteorological 
interactions and air quality. 

VALUE AND CO-BENEFITS 
The knowledge acquired supports operations of services in 
the city during crises and provides information for real-life 
and tabletop simulations, supporting Goal #2 to be prepared 
and adequately respond to extreme climate events or other 
shocks. Besides, it informs the initiatives in Goal #3 for the 
development of more green, cool, secure and flexible urban 
spaces

INDICATORS 
Development of multi-hazard risk assessment mapping, with 
analyses of cascading impacts.

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
Develop multi-hazard assessment mapping, with the use of 
computational  models,  real-time  sensoring  and  Big  Data, 
for better integration of the main risks that affect the urban 
space  of  Rio. These  maps  aim  to  support  analyses  about 
possible interactions of risks in the urban space, mainly but 
not limited to those related to intense rains and winds, heat 
islands and waves, air quality, flooding and landslides, high 
tides and storm surges, epidemics and accidents with urban 
infrastructure. 

The aim is to identify the interactions between climate-related 
challenges and other types of risks in the city, in order to 
form a solid knowledge basis for public managers, academia 
and cities. It must allow for a comprehensive visualization of 
risks and their impacts in the region, to help identify priorities 
for intervention. For example, it is known that excessive heat 
and pollution can diminish the lifespan of concrete structures, 
with  implications  in  the  durability  of  urban  infrastructure. 
Moreover, rain flooding and overflowing of rivers can affect 
mobility.  Therefore  a  map  with  storm  flooding  patterns  is 
supported  by  Strategic  Plan  2017-2020  (Initiative  3.10, 
Flood Control). The Center of Operations Rio monitors in real 
time the heat waves of the city. These two types of maps 
constitute examples of risks that will be present in the multi-
hazard  assessment  maps,  which  will  allow  for  studies  on 
cascading effects. 

With  the  support  of  Big  Data,  historic  data  from  sensors 
and  climate  scenarios,  these  integrated  climate  risk  maps 
become sophisticated tools for urban planning and, in case 
of crises, for the deployment of sufficient and adequate first 
response. This initiative promotes the collaboration between 
public departments and public concessions. 

This initiative is currently being implemented by Rio Resiliente

inventory  of  resources,  improvements  for  first  response 
and post-disaster humanitarian logistics, to be released by 
06/2018.

VALUE AND CO-BENEFITS
Integration of actions through multiple spheres of government; 
support in the identification of weak points in first response 
to disasters, minimization of economic losses and protection 
of human lives.

INDICATORS 
Number of inventoried departments, frequency in the updating 
of inventories, number of recommendations implemented

POTENTIAL PARTNERS
UNISDR,  CEMADEN,  World  Bank,  Civil  Defense,  and 
departments  of  first  response  of  the  other  cities  in  the 
metropolitan  area,  department  of  metropolitan  integration, 
and other national and international institutions specialized in 
crisis and disaster management.

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE 
Develop  a  Disaster  Recovery  Plan  for  the  metropolitan 
region of Rio de Janeiro, promoting integration of actions 
for first response and post-disaster humanitarian logistics.

The  Plan  must  include  an  inventory  of  intellectual  and 
physical  resources  of  all  the  areas  of  Rio  de  Janeiro 
and  its  metropolitan  region,  with  direct  involvement  of 
the  departments  related  to  post-disaster  assistance,  like 
fire  brigade,  civil  defense,  social  services,  health,  among 
others, in all spheres of government. The aim is to make the 
metropolitan region more efficient, agile and cooperative 
in  the  response  to  all  shocks,  including  those  related  to 
resource scarcity, such as water and energy, but mainly the 
shocks related to strong rains and winds, epidemics and 
accidents with urban infrastructure. 

The plan must involve the population, providing guidance 
on how to act in the prevention and recovery after disasters, 
and  indicate  opportunities  for  improvement  in  actions, 
based on the best practices from all over the world. 

Rio  Resiliente  proposed  a  disaster  recovery  plan  for  the 
city of Rio and the Project was incorporated in the Strategic 
Plan 2017-2020. However, the initiative is more ambitious, 
in the fact that it also incorporates the metropolitan region. 
This initiative is in the planning stage.

IMPLEMENTATION
until March 2017.

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
Incorporate  the  operational  and  logistics  legacy  of  the 
Olympics  and  Paralympic  Games  of  2016,  internalizing 
protocols  and  processes  practiced  before  and  during  the 
Games. The Olympic Games constitute a unique opportunity 
for  the  integration  of  various  operational  forces  of  all 
governmental spheres, for an extended period, with common 
objectives. During the Games the city is submitted to high 
stress situations, related to the mobility of workers, athletes 
and  public;  public  safety  and  antiterrorism  measures;  and 
intense exposure in the international media. 

The  preparation  for  the  operations  of  the  Olympics  starts 
more  than  one  year  earlier,  and  it  involves  trainings  and 
simulations  of  low,  medium  and  high  impact  scenarios, 
involving  shocks  and  stresses  related  to  extreme  weather 
events,  accidents  with  urban  infrastructure,  agglomeration 
of people with impact in normalcy and criminal acts in the 
urban space. 

The  lessons  learned  during  the  operations  of  the  city  in 
high alert situations and crises management must generate 
reports at the Center of Operations Rio and be integrated to 
the routine procedures of Rio de Janeiro, so that this newly 
acquired knowledge becomes one more Olympic legacy for 
the City. 

The proposal to develop an operational Olympic legacy was 
made by Rio Resiliente and fully incorporated by the Strategic 
Plan 2017-2020. The initiative is being implemented and 
dozens of general and regional simulations for the Olympics 
have already taken place at the Center of Operations Rio. 

RIO VISION 500

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
Execute  simulations  for  crisis  response  four  times  a  year, 
involving federal, state and municipal operational departments. 
These  simulations,  led  by  the  Center  of  Operations  Rio, 
should incorporate the lessons learned during the Olympics 
and test the resilience of the city to different types of crises, 
focused on the main vulnerabilities of the city, as identified 
in the chapter “Shocks and Chronic Stresses of Rio”, in the 
multi-hazard  risk  assessment  maps  of  initiative  1D,  and  in 
the reports produced by the Rio de Janeiro Panel on Climate 
Change, initiative 1A.

The simulations aim to practice the first response capabilities 
of different public departments and private concessions for 
highly complex problems with significant negative impacts, 
thus  increasing  the  effectiveness  in  real  life  situations  and 
the practical knowledge of public operators and managers. 
The  simulations  provide  opportunity  for  the  self-evaluation 
of  departments  and  the  identification  of  weak  points  or 
insufficiency of resources for crisis response. The simulations 
should  involve  as  much  as  possible  the  metropolitan 
departments and support the execution of initiative 2A, for 
the creation of a disaster recovery plan for the metro region. 

The proposal for the execution of simulations was advanced 
by Rio Resiliente and adopted by the Strategic Plan 2017-
2020. The initiative is in its planning stage.

RIO VISION 500  
Aspiration (III.2.b): The City will be prepared and adapted to 
face  climate  change  and  its  impacts,  having  mapped  and 
planned for its main threats. 

STRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020

GOAL #2 Mobilize Rio to be prepared to respond to extreme weather events and other shocks

INITIATIVE #2D: 

Expand the Program Resilient Communities

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
Expand  the  program  of  training  of  community  leaders 
in  resilience,  and  the  issuing  of  certificates  to  engage 
communities  in  the  theme  of  resilience,  with  knowledge 
about risk, ability to take preventive measures and act during 
and after crises.
The project Resilient Communities began in 2015, led by the 
Civil Defense of the City of Rio, and has as basis the Project 
“Creating  Resilient  Cities:  my  city  is  getting  ready”,  of  the 
United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction 
(UNISDR). In 2015, leaders of 17 vulnerable communities 
signed a certificate declaring their commitment to resilience. 
It is an opportunity to spread basic notions of civil defense 
and  increase  awareness  about  the  recurrent  risks  within 
those communities. 
The objective of this initiative is to involve more communities 
in the signing of this commitment, which is the last step in 
a  process  of  engagement  that  involves  information  about 
shocks and chronic stresses, regular drills for evacuation of 
buildings and assessment of local risks.
This  initiative  aims  to  lower  the  vulnerability  of  citizens  to 
strong  rains  and  winds,  and  in  particular  impacts  related 
to  landslides  and  flooding.  It  is  integrated  with    initiative 
2.C,  which  provides  multi-hazard  maps  through  which 
communities gain knowledge about their own exposure to 
risk.  

VISION RIO 500 
Aspiration (III.2.c) All citizens will be informed, prepared and 
engaged to respond to the impacts of climate change.

VALUE AND CO-BENEFITS 
Increases  social  cohesion  in  and  between  communities; 
empowers  citizens;  fosters  a  culture  of  prevention  and 
preparation. 

INDICATORS 
Number of leaders trained, number of communities involved.  

FOCAL POINTS
Civil Defense and Rio Resiliente.

POTENTIAL PARTNERS
 UNISDR, NGOs located in the communities.

GOAL #3 Cultivate green, cool, safe and flexible urban spaces 

FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE #3.A 

Implement LED Street Lighting

POTENTIAL PARTNERS  
World Bank and departments of public safety. 

FUNDING 
Included  at  the  Strategic  Plan  2017-2020  BRL432,9 
million to substitute 60% of luminaires until 2020, of which 
BRL 69,2 million of own resources and BRL 363,7 million 
of external resources.

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE 
LED lighting has superior quality, better luminosity at a lower 
cost (on average, 50% of the cost of technologies currently 
installed,  benchmarked  by  many  cities  worldwide),  longer 
durability, spends less time for starting up and increases the 
feeling of safety, because it improves facial recognition. 

Electric  energy  in  Brazil  is  highly  dependent  on  the  rain 
patterns and water scarcity in the Southeast of Brazil in the 
summers  of  2014  and  2015  significantly  increased  the 
costs of energy. 

The  installation  of  smart  grid  allows  for  remote  detection 
of defects, adjustable dimming and the use of flickering as 
alert  in  the  case  of  emergency.  Besides,  smart  grids  are 
a  platform  of  the  addition  of  various  kinds  of  sensors,  for 
present  and  future  technologies  related  to  traffic,  security, 
microclimate,  flooding  detection,  etc.  The  project  of  LED 
lighting can support the city to increase the resilience for all 
climate related shocks and stresses, as well as those related 
to accidents with urban infrastructure, saturation of the road 
infrastructure and criminal acts on the urban space. 

STRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020 
Initiative  3.09  –  Covert  public  regular  illumination  lamps 
for  LED  lightning;  Initiative  4.10  –  Urban  renewal  in 
neighborhoods with precarious or nonexistent infrastructure, 
focusing on regions AP 3 and AP 5; Initiative 6.06  – Engage 
PPPs and other external resources to address high priority 
issues of the city.

VALUE AND CO-BENEFITS
Lowers  carbon  emissions  and  increases  the  resilience  of 
the  city  to  water  and  energy  scarcity.  Its  implementation 
can prioritize areas that increase the safety of pedestrians 
and,  therefore,  minimize  criminal  acts  on  urban  spaces. 
Moreover,  smart  grid  could  enhance  our  local  knowledge 
and provide even more details to the multi-hazard risk maps 
(see initiatives 1C and 1D), offering relevant inputs to both 
the climate changes impacts mitigation portfolio of projects 
(initiative 1B) and other projects related to green, safe, fresh 
and flexible urban spaces creation (Goal 3).

INDICATORS
Less  consumption  of  energy;  percentage  of  existing 
luminaires substituted for LED technology. 

This  initiative  was  developed  by  Rio  Resiliente  and  fully 
incorporated by the Strategic Plan 2017-2020. It is in the 
planning phase. 

FOCAL POINTS
Rioluz and Rio Resiliente.

RIO VISION 500  
Aspiration (III.1.a) The City will ensure a low-carbon energy 
matrix; Aspiration (IV.3.a) All regions of the city will have access 
to high quality public infrastructure; Aspiration (IV.2.c) All public 
spaces will be planned and its streets and elevations will be 
active and safe; Aspiration (IV.3.b): The city will be completely 
accessible and pleasant to cyclists, pedestrians, people with 
disabilities,  seniors  and  children;  Aspiration  (VI.3.b)  Public 
resources will be used rationally, with proper management from 
public and private partnerships and social civic organizations to 
ensure high-quality services to all citizens.

GOAL #3 Cultivate green, cool, safe and flexible urban spaces

INITIATIVE #3B: 

Stimulate Arbored-Squares

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
The project Arbored-Squares aims to revitalize and increase 
the  tree  density  of  78  public  squares,  by  planting  a  total 
of  50,000  trees,  thus  allowing  the  greatest  part  of  the 
population to have access to a green area within a 15-minute 
walking distance from its residence. The project will focus on 
the North and West zone, which nowadays have sparse tree 
coverage.  

The squares selected will have a minimum area of 20,000 
square feet, and will have dense tree coverage to increase 
shading and support the microclimate. If the project Arbored-
Squares incorporates more resilient items, it can decrease 
the vulnerabilities of the city to strong rains and winds, heat 
islands and waves, droughts, epidemics and accidents with 
urban infrastructure. 

This  project  is  featured  in  the  Strategic  Plan  2017-202, 
and can be expanded in its scope to add a few benefits of 
resilience, such as:

– Installation of water fountains, to increase thermal comfort 
to the population and decrease internments and obits related 
to extreme high temperatures. 

– Installation of mini-centers of recycling and composting, 
for utilization of citizens and local generation of income.
– Raise awareness for the installation of green roofs around 
the squares.
–  Utilization  of  greywater  in  the  maintenance  of  parks, 
preferably from local rainwater harvesting.
–  Pavement  and  other  surfaces  with  high  permeability,  to 
help protect the area from flooding, to lower absorption of 
solar irradiation and mitigate urban heat islands. 

This  project  was  developed  by  the  Strategic  Plan  2017-
2020 and incorporated with a resilience lens in this strategy. 

RIO VISION 500 
 Aspiration (II.1.d) The city environment will benefit cariocas 
in  a  way  that  everyone  will  cultivate  healthy  habits  for  life 
and have access to resources and information needed for 
a longer and better life; Aspiration (II.3.c) Ageing population 
of  Rio  will  be  dynamic  and  productive;  Aspiration  (II.4.a) 
Everyone will live close to a green area; Aspiration (III.4.b) 
The green areas of the city will be protected and expanded, 
then environmental preservation will become a city asset.

GOAL #3 Cultivate green, cool, safe and flexible urban spaces 

INITIATIVE #3.C 

Improve Resilience in Mobility

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
The mobility projects planned for Rio involve initiatives that 
can contribute to increase the resilience of the city. All those 
projects – new Bus Rapid Transit lines, such as Transbrasil, 
which will move approximately 450,000 people daily; the 
segregated lines of the Bus Rapid System; Light Rail Vehicle; 
and many miles of bike lanes – involve interventions in the 
urban space that can contribute to minimize many shocks 
and chronic stresses of the city. 

Projects  for  mobility  must  be  aligned  with  the  Portfolio  of 
Climate  Change  Mitigation  and  Adaptation,  initiative  1B, 
and  must  involve  in  their  planning  analysis  of  impact  of 
microclimates  in  neighborhoods,  effects  on  “walkability”, 
exposure to climate shocks, such as strong rains and winds 
(including those related to drainage and coastal protection 
against  sea  level  rise);  and  also  adequate  public  lighting 
and  impacts  in  the  sensation  of  security. The  utilization  of 
low  emission  fuels  is  essential  to  the  development  of  a 
resilient  mobility. The  integration  of  different  transportation 
modals cannot be regarded solely as a means of reducing 
commuting time, but also for its ability to increase flexibility 
and generate redundancy, so that eventual interruption of a 
modal can be mitigated by the use of others. 

An ample analysis of the co-benefits of resilience in mobility 
projects constitute opportunity for better access to finance 
options,  considering  the  global  movement  towards  the 
financing  of  climate-smart  projects,  whose  longer  utility  is 
ensured  by  considering  climate  scenarios. The  application 
of a resilience lens in mobility supports the city to deal with 
shocks and stresses like strong rains and winds, heat islands 

and waves, sea level rise, accidents with urban infrastructure, 
agglomeration  of  people  with  impact  in  normalcy,  criminal 
acts in the urban space, and saturation of road infrastructure. 

RIO VISION 500 
Aspiration (III.1.d): City mobility will be sustainable, supported 
by  green  technologies  and  intelligent  urban  planning; 
Aspiration  (IV.1.a)  The  city  will  be  more  compact  and 
densified in tandem with the existing infrastructure; Aspiration 
(IV.1.b) Everyone will be able to ride all over the city using 
high quality and integrated public transportation.

STRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020
Initiative  4.05  –  Improvements  on  the  roads  and  on  the 
quality of buses travel; Initiative 4.06 – Implementation of 
exclusive lanes for public transportation. 

VALUE AND CO-BENEFITS 
Increase  in  the  flexibility  and  robustness  of  the  transport 
system;  support  for  the  development  of  green,  safe,  and 
walkable urban spaces; positive impact in the microclimate 
of  neighborhoods;  increased  attraction  for  climate-related 
finance options; reduction in air pollution; and reduction of 
GHG emissions. 

INDICATORS  
Percentage  of  the  population  that  commutes  daily  via 
high  capacity  transportation;  amount  of  funding  attracted 
by  climate-smart  mobility  projects;  lower  concentration  of 
transport-related air pollution; lower GHG emissions. 

FOCAL POINTS 
Rio  Resiliente  and  departments  of  transportation  and 
planning. 

POTENTIAL PARTNERS
FPJ, ITDP-Brasil, C40, departments of public construction

GOAL #4 : Provide high quality basic services to all citizens, through sustainable and resilient use of resources.

FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE #4.A: 
Develop a Water Strategy

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE 
Develop  a  water  strategy,  incorporating  the  metropolitan 
region and the basin of the Guandu river, involving multiple 
actors  in  the  public,  private,  civil,  academic  and  third 
sectors,  with  the  purpose  of  fostering  the  water  resilience 
of the city and state of Rio de Janeiro. In 2014 and 2015 
the  Southeast  of  Brazil  experienced  low  rainfall  volume. 
Consequently,  the  integrated  reservoir  of  Guandu  reached 
13% of its capacity, a worrying stage considering the fact 
that  this  source  provides  water  to  92%  of  Rio’s  citizens. 
The  preparation  of  a  water  strategy  has  five  objectives;  I) 
Develop  a  preliminary  diagnosis  of  the  water  situation  in 
the city of Rio; II) Establish an integrated approach for the 
urban water; III) Develop projects based on successful cases 
of  water  management;  IV) Align  a  strategy  specifically  for 
the  metropolitan  region,  with  the  engagement  of  actors 
from  the  different  governmental  spheres;  V)  Develop  an 
implementation roadmap. 

The  water  strategy  must  indicate  alternative  means  to 
improve access to water, reduce consumption and deal with 
the urban water cycle more resiliently. The water supply must 
be constant to all citizens and less dependent on a single 

POTENTIAL OF REUSE FROM RAINWATER HARVESTING 

source.  Therefore,  the  water  basins  of  the  river  Guandu, 
located  outside  the  limits  of  the  city  of  Rio  de  Janeiro, 
must be revitalized, in order to guarantee steady water flow 
throughout the year; and universal sanitation network must 
be  implemented,  preventing  the  contamination  of  water 
bodies. 

The diversification of the water matrix in Rio de Janeiro entails 
deepening the knowledge about alternative sources, such as 
watershed in the urban forests (there are three forests located 
within city limits) and the potential for rainwater harvesting, 
mainly in rooftops. The harvesting and reserve of water in 
the  city  must  integrate  gray  infrastructure  to  a  sustainable 
and resilient use of ecosystems. The water cycle in the city, 
little explored and understood yet, should be regarded as a 
whole, so that future interventions do not impact it negatively, 
by enhancing flooding or dry periods. 

For a resilient management of water, it is essential to utilize this 
resource more efficiently and, therefore, the water strategy 
must  also  include  the  active  development  of  new  habits, 
practices  and  technologies  which  induce  the  reduction  in 
consumption; and should identify opportunities for the usage 

The analysis of the potential for reuse of rainwater in the city of Rio de Janeiro was produced through the interpolation of rainfall volumes, as determined by System 
Alerta Rio in the period between 2010 and 2015, crossed with rainfall volume in possible harvesting areas (rooftops) and consequent reduced need for water from 
the underground distribution system, based on consumption data from the population. The consumption data was acquired from the Sanitation National System of 
Information (SNIS) and the 2010 demographic census from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The areas in dark blue show which parts of the 
city could benefit more from harvesting rainwater to lower consumption and water bills.

Rio de Janeiro receives sufficient yearly solar irradiation on 
its available rooftops to power 183% of the energy needed 
by its residents. Besides, solar energy is equitably available 
to every citizen throughout the four seasons, and therefore 
solar  energy  can  promote  equal  access  to  this  basic 
service. Furthermore, in Brazil, the generation of electricity 
is becoming less sustainable in the latest years, due to the 
intense use of thermal plants (up to 25% of the matrix in 
2015). This has had a negative effect in the price of energy 
and the purchasing power of citizens. This trend is opposed 
to the vision of the municipality and its citizens, as indicated 
in the Vision Rio 500, which envisions a low carbon future 
for the city. 

The development of a solar strategy should begin in smaller 
pilot  projects  inside  city  administration.  For  this  reason,  a 
Solar Energy and Energy Efficiency project was initiated in 
the Center of Operations Rio, to be implemented after the 
Olympics.  Considering  the  lessons  learned  in  this  project, 
it  is  possible  to  develop  a  wider  implementation  plan  that 
incorporates  large-scale  cases  from  other  cities,  including 
innovative finance solutions

The strategy for solar energy was proposed by Rio Resiliente 
and RioÁguas was incorporated in the Strategic Plan 2017-
2020 in two different contexts: development of a strategy in 
2018 and support to sustainable buildings.

Realize Energy and Water Efficiency in Public Buildings

INITIATIVE #4.C: 

INITIATIVE #4.D: 

Universal Access to Sanitation

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE 
Realize energy and water efficiency in public buildings, 
with  the  potential  to  zero  the  energy  bill  of  the 
municipality, implemented in tandem with initiative 4.B, 
Solar Energy. 

Due to water scarcity in the beginning of 2015, decree 
nº 39848 of 2015 establishes that City departments 
must  keep  the  same  electricity  budget  as  in  the 
previous year, 2014, despite the rising prices of energy. 
In order to meet that goal, it is essential to investigate 
the true potential for lower consumption of water and 
energy. For this reason, Rio Resiliente sought to start 
this investigation through a department with the highest 
possible  impact,  from  a  technical  standpoint  but  also 
for co-benefits of education and behavior. Therefore, a 
study was carried out to calculate the reduction potential 
in more than 1450 school units in the municipality, the 
largest school network in Latin America. 

In  total,  schools  in  Rio  use  approximately  80GWh  of 
electricity and 4 million m3 of water per year (reference 
2015).  The  study,  which  included  sight  visits  to  a 
sample  of  schools,  identified  a  potential  reduction  of 
39% (31GWh) for electricity and 58% reduction (2,4 
million m3) for water. The potential for solar energy in 
rooftops was also calculated to be able generate 101 
GWh/year, sufficient to cover all needs. This represents 
potential  savings  of  BRL  122  million  per  year,  more 
than the actual costs: in fact, the electricity bills could 
be zeroed and still generate income for expansion in 
the number of schools. 
 
The  analysis  for  the  potential  of  water  and  energy 
efficiency in schools was carried out with technical and 
financial  support  of  the World  Bank.  Considering  the 
different typologies of buildings and distinct use, new 
diagnosis  for  hospital  and  other  public  buildings  are 
necessary. The project was initiated by Rio Resiliente, in 
partnership with the Secretary of Education and Pensa 
Sala  de  Ideias,  and  provides  support  for  the  meeting 
of  the  energy  efficiency  goals  stated  in  the  Strategic 

Plan 2017-2020.

GOAL #5:Promote an inclusive, diversified, circular and low-carbon economy

FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE #5.A: 

Create an Agency for the Promotion of Circular Economy

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE 
Creation  of  a  department  within  the  City  with  three  main 
objectives:  a)  send  less  waste  to  landfills,  b)  generate  jobs, 
through  the  valuation  of  waste,  c)  support  the  efficiency  of 
resources, such as water, food and materials, with no wasteful 
practices, in order to develop a circular, diversified, inclusive and 
low-carbon economy. 

Nowadays, the consumption and production patterns follow a 
linear model of extraction, use and disposal. On the one hand 
there is more demand for primary products, with the increased 
of extraction and associated environmental impacts; on the other 
hand  there  is  a  growing  generation  of  residue,  which  create 
problems for transportation and disposal. The circular economy 
proposes that products should be developed already considering 
the  extension  of  its  lifetime,  reuse,  recycling,  upcycling  and 
transformation. 

Large cities are, in fact, businesses ecosystems which can act in 
an integrated manner, so that the waste generated by one industry 
may become a primary product for another. The recycling and 
transformation of products has the enormous potential to create 
jobs related to the reuse of products at artisanal and industrial 
scales but also for the creative economy. 

The  jobs  created  have  the  potential  to  insert  in  the  formal 
economy low-skilled workers and create opportunities for those 
in  the  fields  of  engineering,  chemistry  and  product  design. 
For  example,  currently  exists  a  nearly  100%  collection  and 
recycling of aluminum cans and this happens because there are 
economically viable industrial processes that allow this closed 
circuit. One of the objectives of the Agency is to understand 
the dynamics of the local industries, identify opportunities in the 
world market for commodities, connect parts and promote new 
means for the reuse of materials. 

The diversification of the Rio’s economy is one of the ways to 
become more resilient to economic shocks of all kinds. 

The Agency for the Promotion of Circular Economy will act to:
-  identify  opportunities  and  new  businesses  in  the  industries 
related to the reuse of waste and materials;
- promote the reuse of organic waste, by large generators, such 
as hotels, supermarkets and tree pruning; but also by residents, 

through composting;
- promote entrepreneurship through reuse, recycling, upcycling 
and  transformation,  connecting  the  many  existing  initiatives 
spread around the city, to reach economy of scale. 

Currently, selective street collection is eight times more expensive 
than  general  street  collection. 
International  experiences 
demonstrate, however, that this cost can be minimized or totally 
covered by the resale of residue at market prices. There are also 
solutions in which the citizens are part of the collection chain, 
that is, actively return materials used in a distributed form. For 
this reason, it is necessary to identify the barriers that impede 
sectors to become more resilient, lucrative and sustainable, and 
act to connect the different needs, pointing out value generation 
opportunities.  

Organic waste comprises 32% of all waste in Rio de Janeiro 
and  is  sent  primarily  to  a  landfill  in  the  neighboring  city  of 
Seropédica. In landfills, organic matter releases methane gas in 
its decomposition, which is highly pollutant. However, the product 
of composting, which could be processed inside residences, in 
public squares, or in large scale, can generate fertilizers to urban 
gardens and agricultural production inside the city, minimizing 
costs and emissions from food transport and creating jobs. 

This  is  an  initiative  proposed  by  Rio  Resiliente  and  is  in  its 
planning stage.  

RIO VISION 500 
Aspiration  (III.1.c)  All  residential  waste  will  be  minimized, 
reused,  transformed  and  converted  into  energy;  Aspiration 
(III.4.c)  Local  and  state  food  production  will  be  fostered, 
increasing  people  access  to  a  healthy  diet; Aspiration  (V.1.a) 
The city will be an important knowledge hub where research 
and innovation will attract high value-added partners; Aspiration 
(V.1.b) Rio will be an international hub for creative economy; 
Aspiration  (V.1.c)  Rio  will  be  the  main  tourism,  business  and 
social  center  of  Latin America; Aspiration  (V.2.c)  Unregulated 
labor  reduced  will  be  drastically,  guaranteeing  workers’  rights 
and increasing productivity; Aspiration (V.3.b) Rio will have the 
best entrepreneurship ecosystem of Latin America; Aspiration 
(VI.1.a): The city will be recognized for its quality on planning, 
execution, maintenance and controls systems coordination.

VALUE AND CO-BENEFITS 
The project addresses the livelihood of people in condition 
of  social  vulnerability;  accumulation  of  residues  in  slopes, 
streets  and  rivers;  and  also  shocks  to  the  food  supply. 
Furthermore, it reduces the existence of and emissions from 
landfills,  as  well  as  promotion  of  circularity  in  the  cycle  of 
biological nutrients and materials. 

INDICATORS
Number  of  minicenters,  number  of  participants,  volume  of 
composting, volume of distributed composting products to 
local agriculture and volume of solid waste reintroduced in 
the production chain. 

FOCAL POINTS 
Rio  Resiliente,  Comlurb,  departments  of  food  security  and 
agriculture.

POTENTIAL PARTNERS
C40, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, department of environment.

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
This initiative aims to involve the civil society in the valorization 
of solid and organic waste, with the support of the Agency for 
the Promotion of Circular Economy, initiative 5.A. 

Minicenters of recycling and composting will be established 
in  neighborhoods  (see  initiative  #3B,  “Arbored  Squares”). 
Those minicenters, either public or private, will be meeting 
points  for  actions  for  the  valorization  of  solid  and  organic 
waste,  and  can  be  the  end  point  for  formal  and  informal 
transactions via cell phone apps. Actions should involve the 
composting of organic residue for the use of residents and 
distribution for urban gardening and local agriculture, and can 
involve many techniques of composting, in various scales. 
Besides,  those  minicenters  must  promote  opportunities 
to  increase  the  useful  life  of  materials,  through  reuse  and 
exchange.  Therefore,  it  is  possible  to  achieve  not  only 
valorization of what otherwise would become waste and sent 
to landfill, but also prevent its generation in the first place, 
and  thus  incentivize  a  culture  of  consumption  that  is  less 
wasteful and more circular. 

The initiative involves the engagement of many stakeholders, 
such  as  residents  and  business  owners,  and  also  the 
professionalization  of  workers  already  occupied  with  the 
collection of recyclable products.   

RIO VISION 500  
Aspiration (III.1.c) All residential waste will be minimized, 
reused, transformed and converted into energy; Aspiration 
(III.4.c) A Local and state food production will be fostered, 
increasing  people  access  to  a  healthy  diet;  (V.3.b)  Rio 
will be the main tourism, business and sociability center

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE #6: Increase the resilience of the population and promote social cohesion

FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE #6.A: 

Educate the Youth for Resilience 

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
The project Resilient Youth aims to develop and implement 
a curriculum on Urban Resilience for students of municipals 
schools, reaching 100,000 children until 2020. 

The  Resilient  Youth  program  will  comprise  three  main 
subjects: 1) The impact of climate change in cities and how 
this affects youth’s lives; 2) The basics of civil defense, with 
notions about disaster preparedness;
3) Sustainable consumption and resource efficiency, mainly 
that of water and energy, as well as notions of reuse, recycling, 
upcycling and transformation of materials and products. 

The project is based on the premise that children need to be 
knowledgeable of the risks in their neighborhood and city, 
and develop a resilient behavior at the start of life. 

Resilient  Youth  consists  of  a  thematic  expansion  of  a 
successful  current  Project  called  Civil  Defense  in  Schools, 
developed by the Civil Defense of the city since 2013, and 
implemented primarily on schools close to areas considered 
being  under  high  and  medium  geological  risk.  Nearly  five 
thousand children between 10 and 12 have already attended 
classes  and  received  a  certificate  by  the  Civil  Defense  in 
Schools program, which focuses mainly on the basics of civil 
defense and first aid. 

The goal of Resilient Youth is to educate children about the 
challenges  of  their  city  and  the  world,  and  thus  promote 
a  culture  of  prevention  and  risk  mitigation,  environmental 
awareness and citizenship. 

An  adapted  version  of  the  Individual  Resilience  Indicators 
(initiative 6.B), aimed at school children, can be applied at 
the start and end of the school year to assess the knowledge 
acquired and measure how it impacts individual resilience. 

This  is  a  project  first  proposed  by  Rio  Resiliente  and 
incorporated in Strategic Plan 2017-2020, and is currently 
in a planning stage.

RIO VISION 500 
Aspiration (I.2.a) City Schools will become national reference, 
adding  value,  being  collaborative  and  connected  to  the 
students’  reality;  Aspiration  (III.2.b)  The  City  will  be  ready 
and adapted to face climate change and its impacts, having 
mapped and planned for its main threats; Aspiration (III.2.c) 
All citizens will be informed, prepared and engaged to deal 
with climate change impacts. 

STRATEGIC PLAN 2017-2020
Initiative 3.12: Increase the resilience of the city doubling the 
number of climate risk under monitoring and quadrupling the 
number of simulations for emergency response with at least

Bruna Santos  is  Program  Officer  at  the  Columbia  Global  Center  Rio,  where  she  works  in  the 
management of multisector projects, focused on innovation in public administration, citizen engagement 
and sustainability. After six years outside of Brazil, she decided to return to Rio, believe that the city is 
at the epicenter of a transformation in the way that the government deals with society. “The work of Rio 
Resiliente is an example of what can be done with evidence-based public policies, centered on people 
and leveraged by technologies.

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE 
Create and implement a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) 
on Urban Resilience, comprised of modules for the public in 
general, public servants (mainly those of the Carioca Leaders 
team, Center of Operations Rio, Civil Defense, departments 
of education, urbanism and environment) and city teachers. 
There is also the possibility that the course becomes part of 
the yearly performance bonus for civil servants more directly 
involved with resilience.  

Education  for  resilience  is  essential  not  only  because  it 
increases awareness in individuals, but because it helps form 
new practitioners for resilience, bringing in specialists from 
various disciplines, such as urban planners, environmentalists, 
public  and  private  managers,  entrepreneurs,  insurance, 
finance,  health  and  law  professionals.  It  then  becomes 
possible  for  them  to  incorporate  the  application  of  the 
resilience  lens  in  their  practices,  and  also  stimulate  the 
exchange  of  knowledge. The  course  will  be  available  in  a 
specialized  online  platform,  comprising  videos,  texts  and 
assessment  tests,  with  certification  in  the  end,  preferably 
through a partnership with a university. 

The course will present the concept of urban resilience, the 
best  practices  around  the  world,  and  deepen  the  debate 
through the discussion of the vulnerabilities of Rio de Janeiro 
and other cities. There will be an emphasis on three main 
topics: urban climate-related challenges, how to increase the 
resilience of individuals, and how to develop a sustainable 
consumptions, related to the production and use of resources 
such  as  water,  food,  materials  and  energy.  One  or  two  of 
the  modules  will  be  exclusive  to  teachers,  and  will  aim  to 
prepare them to teach the course on Urban Resilience to 
school children, in the program Resilient Youth (initiate 6.A). 

The MOOC on Urban Resilience is an initiative developed by 
Rio Resiliente that was incorporated into the Strategic Plan 

2017-2020. It is an educational initiative that targets all the 
shocks and chronic stresses of the city.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE #6: Increase the resilience of the population and promote social cohesion

INITIATIVE #6.C: 

Develop Individual Resilience Indicators

DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE
Apply,  improve  upon  and  utilize  the  resilience  individual 
indicators to learn more about the current state of resilience of 
citizens and communities, in order to monitor the effectiveness 
of policies on resilience and support the creation of new public 
policies at local level. 

The  Individual  Resilience  Indicators  establish  three  levels  of 
analysis: social, contextual and individual vulnerability. Citizens 
are more or less resilient in relation to their social context - it is 
known that vulnerable populations are always more susceptible 
to shocks of all kinds, and they also take longer to recover. 
Unequal access to basic services such as sanitation, water and 
health also increases exposure to various risks. 

The resilience of an individual, as well as of its community, also 
varies depending on the vulnerabilities specific to their living 
or  working  spaces,  denominated  contextual  resilience.  For 
example, some people live in areas more susceptible to risks, 
such as landslides, river flooding, sea level rise, among others. 

The  third  level  of  analysis  is  individual  resilience,  related  to 
knowledge  about  risks,  disaster  preparedness  and  personal 
habits,  such  as  eliminating  mosquito  breeding  grounds,  or 
keep at home emergency items, like water, batteries, lanterns, 
among other items specific to their context. 

The  scientific  literature  about  crisis  and  resilience,  the  basis 
for the development of the indicators, indicates that a culture 
of  prevention  and  enhanced  knowledge  about  risks  in  the 
everyday life, make citizens more resilient to all kinds of shocks 
and increases the effectiveness of public policies. 

The Individual Resilience Indicators were developed by WRI 
Brasil/Cidades Sustentáveis in collaboration with Rio Resiliente 
in  2015,  with  the  input  and  support  of  City  managers, 
especially Civil Defense, Instituto Pereira Passos and PENSA, 

along  with  the  hosting  of  several  workshops  with  the  civil 
society (academia, NGOs). Many cities around the world have 
already demonstrated the interest to adopt the indicators, with 
adaptations related to their specific resilience challenges. 

The  indicators  will  be  applied  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  three 
different ways: citywide, with the support of research institutes, 
for an overview of the individual resilience of citizens; inside 
city schools, before and after the course on Urban Resilience 
(initiative  1.A),  to  assess  knowledge  acquisition  at  practical 
level; and at community level, for the identification of strong 
and weak aspects, and eventual adjustment of public policies. 

The  application  of  the  Individual  Resilience  Indicators  was 
proposed  by  Rio  Resiliente  and  adopted  by  the  Strategic 
Plan  2017-2020,  with  goals,  milestones  and  budget.  This 
initiative aims to measure knowledge about vulnerabilities and 
preparedness to disasters, and therefore tackles all the shocks 
and stresses of the city.  

RIO VISION 500
Aspiration  (III.3.b):  The  city  will  be  ready  and  adapted  to 
face  climate  change  and  its  impacts,  having  mapped  and

recognized for its quality on planning, execution, maintenance 
and  controls  systems  coordination; Aspiration  (VI.1.b):  Best

Technology by the Imperial College London. Her master’s thesis focused on the opportunity for a circular 
economy in Brazil.

Those three women have been instrumental in the research and development of the Individual Resilience Indicators in partnership with Rio 
Resiliente, soon to be first tested in Rio. 

 “We are in a century with interdependent challenges, such as climate change, social inequality, a growing urban population and resource 
efficiency. Rio Resiliente transcends the isolated dealing with those challenges, increasing dialogue between city departments and the civil 
society”, says Katerina.
