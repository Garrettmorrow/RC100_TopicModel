My city through my eyes

No single image or story captures the city of Chennai. Experiences overlap, refract 
and reflect to form an ever-changing collage of the city's struggles and triumphs.

Discover  the  city's  many  stories  through  the  eyes  of  its  people.  Immigrants 
seeking  work,  students,  industrialists,  fisher  folk,  movie  stars  and  scientists  all 
living side by side. You will find today's Chennai is a kaleidoscope of traditional 

Madras and modern Chennai.

Classical  and  Contemporary,  Rich  and  Poor,  Acceptance  and  Aggression, 
Discipline and Disregard, Floods and Drought, Concrete and Greenery, all come 

together to give you a city with a history and a future.

This, then, is the path to building resilience in our city. When you plan for one, you 
plan for the other. When you make room for the river, you recharge ground water. 
When you resettle the poor, integrate them with the more affluent. When citizens 
talk of their rights, remind them of their responsibilities. Consolidate when you 
need  to,  decentralise  where  appropriate.  Where  there  is  blue,  plan  for  green. 

Where there are silos, integrate.

As we move into the future, we need a city strategy that considers and respects 
these  many  truths,  embracing  diverse  conditions  and  needs.  A  strategy  that 

makes our city enlightened, just, integrated.

Dear Reader,

I  am  pleased  to  present  to  you  Chennai’s  Resilience  Strategy  on  behalf  of  the  city  of 
Chennai.  This  comprehensive  document  is  a  result  of  a  strong  multi-stakeholder 
consultation  process  and  has  generated  86  actions  and  recommendations  for  us  to 
collectively address as a society. We are sincerely grateful to all the citizens and experts 
from academia, the private sector, civil society and government, who have contributed to 
developing this robust resilience strategy. We have to now work towards the realization 
of this ambitious strategy.

We  appreciate  the  Chief  Resilience  Officer  Mr.  Krishna  Mohan  Ramachandran  and 
his  team  for  strengthening  the  understanding  of  resilience  throughout  the  city.  The 
strategy process began with the Preliminary Resilience Assessment of the city, which my 
predecessor Dr. D. Karthikeyan, I.A.S. oversaw. He poignantly noted that, 

The city of Chennai and the people of Chennai have shown remarkable 
resilience over the years. It is ingrained in the soul of our city.” 

Our people continue to remain some of the most resilient in the world as we collectively 
face the shocks and stresses posed by nature.

The resilience strategy identifies healthy and planned urbanization, and our water system, 
as two key priority areas and pillars.  Some of our ongoing resilience building efforts such 
as water bodies restoration and decentralized composting units have been highlighted in 
this document, and I can assure you that we are making significant progress. 

The  Greater  Chennai  Corporation  (GCC)  has  prioritized  protecting  and  strengthening 
its green and blue assets to ensure that investing in resilience delivers for our future 
generations. GCC maintains 210 water bodies, and after the 2015 floods, we have taken up 
office and campus rainwater harvesting, restoration and rejuvenation of our traditional 
temple  tanks,  ponds  and  lakes,  in  order  to  recharge  groundwater  and  accommodate 
flood water.

At present, the restoration work of around 52 water bodies has been taken up at a cost of 
Rs. 18.20 crores, and Villivakkam Tank (25 acres) is being restored for Rs. 16 crores utilizing 
funding from Chennai Smart City Ltd. We have signed MoUs with various NGOs and the 
private sector to restore 28 water bodies at a cost of Rs. 9.78 crores. The restoration and 
rejuvenation of 94 water bodies will be taken up in 2019-2020 at a cost of Rs. 60 crores. 
On completion of all the projects, around 1 TMC of water will be available to Chennai, and 
this will help increase the groundwater table in urban areas, and relieve water stagnation 
in various neighbourhoods.

In addition, the Honorable Late Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, on the floor of the assembly 
during 2014, announced that the government would construct an Integrated Storm Water 
Drain network in extended areas of GCC under G.O. Ms. No. 1, MAWS dated 02.01.2015, 
at a cost of Rs. 4034 crores. We have nearly completed the Integrated Storm Water Drain 
network project covering a length of 405 km at a cost of Rs. 1261.70 crores funded by the 
World Bank in the Adyar and Coovum basins. GCC is currently raising funds for similar 
projects  in  Kosasthalaiyar  and  Kovalam  basins.  In  addition,  Rs.  500  crores  have  been 
spent  to  mitigate  floods  in  the  core  Chennai  city  area  since  2016.  We  are  proactively 
taking steps to strengthen resilience in the city.

Related actions, some of which are outlined in the resilience strategy, can succeed if our 
citizens move from being observers to active citizenry. We are now witnessing a thriving 
civil  society  that  is  willing  to  partner  with  government  to  solve  some  of  our  society’s 
greatest challenges such as solid waste management. After the 2015 floods, we have also 
observed a monumental increase in the number of volunteers who would like to help us 
with disaster relief efforts. Such partnerships and citizen efforts increase our confidence 
of a better future for all our citizens. 

We  recognize  there  are  issues  which  require  a  deeper  scientific  understanding  as 
highlighted in the strategy. For example, the strategy rightly highlights the need to be 
more sensitive towards climate change related risks as a threat to our city. To address 
this,  we  need  to  develop  a  better  understanding  of  how  global  climate  change  may 
trigger sea level rise along our coast and how we may proactively minimize the negative 
implications of these processes to adapt to climate change. Therefore, to address such 
resilience  challenges,  I  strongly  believe  there  is  tremendous  potential  for  science  and 
technology to inform our decision making. 

Our  goal  is  to  make  Chennai  the  most  liveable  city  in  the  country  and  this  resilience 
strategy will help us achieve that goal. We thank 100 Resilient Cities and the Rockefeller 
Foundation for supporting our city through this incredible journey, and most importantly, 
for building our understanding of resilience. 

Sincerely,

Commissioner G. Prakash
Greater Chennai Corporation

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) organization, I would like to extend 
my  congratulations  to  the  City  of  Chennai,  Commissioner  Mr.  G.  Prakash,  Former 
Commissioner  Dr.  D.  Karthikeyan  and  Chief  Resilience  Officer  Mr.  Krishna  Mohan 
Ramachandran on the release of this great city’s first ever Urban Resilience Strategy.  This 
effort is the result of two years of tireless effort of leaders, stakeholders and community 
members across the city, but particular thanks are due to Deputy Commissioner (Works) 
Mr. M. Govinda Rao, Chief Engineer (Storm Water Drain, Special Projects and Bus Route 
Roads  Departments)  Mr.  Nandakumar,  and  his  team  at  the  Control  Room  of  Greater 
Chennai Corporation for their oversight of the strategy process and for contributing their 
expertise. At 100RC we always say building resilience requires a team effort and Chennai’s 
CRO Krishna Mohan had a dedicated team working with him to lay the foundation for this 
progressive work so I would also like to extend my thanks not only to Krish, but his team 
as well. Thank you, Arjun Bhargava, Dr. Ashwin Mahalingam, Dr. Parama Roy, Akshaya 
Ayyangar, Tushar Thakkar, and Ashwin Chandrasekharan.  

Working to build resilience in a city as complex and as dynamic as Chennai is a daunting 
challenge.  Chennai  is  an  historic  city.  It  is  a  megacity  in  the  most  urbanized  state  in 
the  world’s  most  rapidly  urbanizing  country.  Chennai  is  diverse,  prone  to  flooding 
and  droughts,  has  vast  informal  settlements  and  has  outgrown  much  of  its  critical 
infrastructure.  However, even in the face of these challenges, we have seen a commitment 
to resilience in Chennai that rivals any city in our network. This strategy is built on the 
foundation of a robust multi-stakeholder process that identified critical actions not only 
for government to take, but also for civil society and citizens to ensure that the whole city 
is working together to build a more resilient future. In Chennai’s leadership we have also 
seen a strong desire to learn from peers and share knowledge around the world.  So far, 
Chennai’s resilience journey has included stops in New Delhi, Addis Ababa, New York and 
Singapore.

This  strategy  maps  a  path  to  healthy  and  planned  urbanization,  a  water  system  that 
serves  and  protects  the  whole  city,  disaster  readiness,  and  inclusion  and  equity  for 
Chennai’s  most  vulnerable  communities.  And  while  the  strategy  presents  a  holistic 
picture  of  what  this  great  city  can  be,  I  would  like  to  call  out  the  work  that  Krish  and 
his team have done in making sure this strategy reflects the needs of and gives a voice 
to Chennai’s most vulnerable. This Resilience Strategy is world class and I am looking 
forward to seeing how it evolves in the years to come. This document, however, is just the 
start; the urgent and important task lies ahead in implementing these actions and I know 
that Chennai is committed to this change. I invite all of Chennai’s citizens to continue to 
make your voices heard by working together to bring this work to life.  

This is a defining moment in Chennai’s 400-year-old history. We are the first among all of 
India’s mega cities to have crafted a resilience strategy that puts forward a blue print to 
help our city adapt, change, nurture and grow, despite the stresses and shocks a thriving, 
rapidly urbanising city can encounter.

Our journey in Chennai began in 2014 and the process of building a Resilience Strategy 
gained traction in 2017. This involved deep engagement with over 3000 stakeholders via 
working group meetings, workshops, one-on-one interviews, online and offline surveys, 
and with students from 5 universities. Our Resilience Strategy consists of five pillars, 17 
goals, and 86 distinct interventions. It is a high level and comprehensive document that 
addresses a range of resilience issues, with examples from the 100RC member cities and 
from within our own city that serve as inspiration to mitigate these challenges.

We have a vision of a city that revives our deep historical relationship with water and 
grows into its water basins and suburbs by protecting and preserving our water bodies 
as an integral and priceless part of our urban fabric. A city that embraces its vulnerable 
communities  and  treats  them  as  key  stakeholders  in  resilience  building.  A  city  whose 
leadership and governance have a ‘big picture’ view to make informed, coordinated, and 
more efficient decisions; where learnings are institutionalized and healthy engagement 
between  and  within  stakeholder  groups  results  in  improved  outcomes  and  greater 
impact. A cleaner, greener Chennai!

I would like to call out four projects that evolved from our strategy process which have 
the potential to transform our city. First, the Urban Horticulture project initiated with 
the  University  of  British  Columbia  will  now  be  scaled-up  into  a  city-wide  project  and 
comes with a host of benefits for our city. Second, the Water as Leverage project, led 
by Mr. Henk Ovink, the Special Envoy for International Water Affairs from the Kingdom 
of  Netherlands,  has  the  potential  to  reshape  our  city’s  ability  to  absorb,  store  and 
manage our water. Third, an initiative to create an in-situ upgradation model for informal 
settlements close to a waterway in Chitra Nagar will make us a more inclusive city. Finally, 
the Data Observatory will help our leadership make better informed decisions.

While these and other projects in this Resilient Chennai Strategy have the potential to 
bring about transformative change in our city, I must end with a message that I have come 
to believe in more strongly than ever: that in order to bring about positive change and 
build a more resilient Chennai, we, as a people, must become more resilient ourselves; 
we need to meaningfully engage with civic issues, to believe that our voices do matter, to 
have a sense of ownership and responsibility towards our city. We must keep cynicism at 
bay and take small steps or make giant leaps towards a more resilient future. 

Inclusive, environmentally sustainable, economically viable, and culturally vibrant. This 
is OUR Chennai. Enlightened. Just. Integrated.  

Sincerely,

Michael Berkowitz
President, 100 Resilient Cities

Sincerely,

Krishna Mohan
Chief Resilience Officer (CRO), Chennai

executive 
summary

From a cluster of fishing villages 
in the 16th Century to the fourth largest 
metropolitan area in India today, Chennai has come 
a long way. The city’s economy boasts a GDP of $58 billion 
and a growth rate of 6%. Chennai’s economy has diversified 
substantially over the past two decades. It now includes 
the automobile and Information Technology industries, 
the healthcare industry, financial services, post-secondary 
educational institutions and a manufacturing sector 
producing various types of hardware. The city is a key player 
in the state and national economies: it contributes 60% to 
Tamil Nadu’s manufacturing sector and produces 60% of 
India’s automotive exports. Furthermore, as India’s ‘software 
as a service’ capital and the most preferred destination for 
medical tourists from within India and abroad, Chennai has 
achieved important global status.

This  trajectory  of  development  and  diversification  has  made 
the city vibrant and cosmopolitan. However, it has also invited 
a range of challenges, including uneven development, which 
has aggravated risks faced by vulnerable communities, rapid 
and  unplanned  growth,  which  has  resulted  in  water  body 
encroachment,  waste  mismanagement  and  an  increased 
impact  of  natural  disasters.  Compounding  all  of  this  is  the 
nature  of  Chennai’s  governance  system;  the  system  tasked 
with addressing these myriad and interconnected challenges 
is  characterized  by  multiple  actors  with  overlapping  and 
sometimes unclear mandates and jurisdictions.

v

Chennai  was  selected  in  2014  as  one  of  the  second 
cohort  of  cities  for  the  100  Resilient  Cities  (100RC) 
programme. Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, 
the 100RC programme 

 …help(s) cities around the world become more 
resilient to the physical, social and economic 
challenges that are a growing part of the 21st 
century.” 

Chennai’s  partnership  with  100RC  has  provided  the 
opportunity to start addressing challenges in a holistic 
manner and incorporating resilience thinkingi into the 
city’s future development path.

A  major  flooding  event  in  Chennai  in  2015  added 
momentum  to  this  development.  It  led  to  a  new 
recognition  among  government,  civil  society  and 
academia  about  the  critical  nature  and  extent  of 
interconnectedness  of  the  city’s  challenges.  There 
was  also  a  new  awareness  that  crises  like  floods 
and  droughts  were  becoming  increasingly  frequent. 
Thus,  post  2015,  Chennai  began  to  actively  address 

i Resilience thinking in policy and projects help build “the capacity of individu-
als, communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, 
adapt and grow, no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks 
they experience.”

Resilient Chennai 

Vision

Enlightened. Just. Integrated.

Our city leaders and citizens will think holistically, 

ecologically and with foresight, as well as act 

proactively and smartly to manage and respond 

to risks and vulnerabilities. We will leverage 
the linkages between urban, socio-cultural, 

economic and environmental development. We 
will be sensitive to the needs of those who are 
disadvantaged and will think and plan ahead of 

time to build a cleaner, greener, more liveable and 

inclusive city.

Enlightened: A city that revives our deep historical 

relationship with water and expands into our 

water basins and peri-urban areas by protecting 

and preserving our water bodies as an integral and 
priceless part of our urban fabric; where citizens 
take ownership and engage with civic issues to 
create public spaces that bring joy and pride, 

strengthening the city’s vibrant cultural identity; a 
city that cultivates champions of change in schools 
and colleges by teaching our youth to respect the 
natural world, embrace diversity, live sustainably 
and believe that their voices can be heard and do 

matter.

Just: A city that embraces its vulnerable peoples 
and treats them as key stakeholders in resilience 

building, who contribute and benefit from 

resilience strategies; where participatory planning 

protects multiple interests and visions; a city 

designed to be equitable and inclusive, ensuring 
that the needs of all sections of society are met.

Integrated: A city whose leadership and governance 
have a ‘big picture’ view to make better informed, 

more efficient decisions; where learnings are 

institutionalized and healthy engagement 

between and within stakeholder groups results 
in streamlined, integrated systems leading to 

improved outcomes with greater impact.

Inclusive, environmentally sustainable, 

economically viable, and culturally vibrant. This is 

OUR Chennai… 

Enlightened. Just. Integrated.  

common  city  shocks  and  stresses  with  concerted  and 
holistic  efforts.  For  example,  while  the  Sustainable  Water 
Security  Mission  was  launched  in  September  2015,  it 
gained  momentum  only  after  the  December  2015  floods. 
The  mission  aims  at  leveraging  public,  private,  and  civic 
resources to restore water bodies and meet the city's water 
demand by prioritizing activities such as recycling and rain

selected 

its  Chief 

Chennai 
Resilience  Officer, 
Mr.  Krishna  Mohan  Ramachandran,  in  2017,  through  a 
Memorandum  of  Understanding  signed  between  the 
Greater  Chennai  Corporation  and  100  Resilient  Cities  in 
2017. His team leveraged this rising awareness and interest 
among city stakeholders to work with over 3,300 Chennai 
residents,  experts,  activists  and  government  officials  to 
develop this document, the Resilient Chennai Strategy. 

This  document  offers  a  pathway  for  city  leaders  from 
government, civic and industrial sectors to collaborate and 
guide their organizations to ensure the future resilience of 
Chennai citizens and infrastructure, both natural and man-
made, to respond to key shocks and stresses in the city.

The  Resilient  Strategy  is  driven  by  a  collectively-defined 
vision  to  make  Chennai  enlightened,  just  and  integrated 
through five missions that address the key challenge areas 
identified by stakeholders. 

Each mission's goals will be achieved through a range of 
actions and recommendations, some of which are already 
under way, while some are being planned and others are still 
ideas inspired by 100RC network cities. With over 80 such 
interventions across five key thematic areas, the Resilient 
Chennai Strategy is an ambitious document that presents 
actionable,  tangible  and  feasible  initiatives,  along  with 
some  relatively  challenging,  longer-term,  transformative 
efforts to build Chennai’s resilience. 

With faith in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s saying, 

What is not started today is never finished 
tomorrow,” 

the  city  of  Chennai  is  ready  to  take  the  leap  towards  a 
resilient future.

CHAPTER 02

unpacking 
resilience

Originally  a  topic  of  academic  research  in  the  1970s, 
the concept of resilience has since taken hold in policy 
and popular discourse, particularly since the beginning 
of  the  millennium.  Resilience  is  largely  applied  to  the 
context of environmental disruptions as a way of thinking 
about how system equilibrium can be maintained in the 
face  of  ecological  disasters—or,  as  Wagner  and  Breil 
(2013) suggest, how communities 

… withstand stress, survive, adapt, and bounce 
back from a crisis or disaster and rapidly move on1”. 

In  fact,  the  term  resilience  originates  from  the  Latin 
word  resilio,  which  means  “to  bounce  back”2.  A  review 
of  the  concept  of  urban  resilience  by  Meerow  et  al. 
(2016) highlights this predominant (and arguably narrow) 
understanding  of  resilience  as  a  city’s  or  community’s 
ability to cope with major shocks and recover quickly, with 
all its social, economic, and political systems returning to 
their usual functioning3. Increasingly, however, scientists 
also  recognize  the  need  to  think  of  resilience  in  terms 
of  the  transformative  capacity  of  people/communities 

9

to  bring  about  change  for  the  better—rather  than  just 
reproducing  a  status  quo.  Resilience  here  need  not 
imply  a  response  to  disasters  or  disturbances,  but 
rather a continual effort towards change for the better 
(see Table 1 for a range of definitions of resilience).

RESILIENCE FOR 100 RESILIENT CITIES (100RC)

(being 

inclusive),  and 

The 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) program conceptualizes 
resilience using a broader (going beyond environmental 
risks),  deeper 
longer  term 
(focusing  equally  on  immediate  and  future  concerns) 
lens.  By  saying  that  "(w)e  help  cities  around  the  world 
become  more  resilient  to  the  physical,  social,  and 
economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st 
century,”  100RC  acknowledges  that  building  resilience 
should  not  be  limited  to  addressing  environmental 
shocks and stresses. 

individuals,  communities, 

Consequently, 100RC defines resilience as “the capacity 
of 
institutions,  businesses, 
and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow, no 
matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks 
they  experience.”  By  explicitly  accommodating  chronic 
stresses  and  shocks  within  the  scope  of  resilience, 
100RC highlights the need to think about all the possible 
challenges  cities  face,  both  in  the  short  and  the  long 
term, whether they be one-time events (such as floods, 

UNPACKING RESILIENCE

earthquakes, or terror attacks) or ongoing stresses (such 
as  water  shortage,  climate  change,  encroachment,  or 
racial inequity). For 100RC, 

(C)ity resilience is about making a city better,
in both good times and bad, for the benefit
of all its citizens, particularly the poor and
vulnerable.”

This  highlights  resilience  as  not  just  a  response  to 
major  shocks  or  negative  events  or  as  limited  to 
bouncing  back  to  the  status  quo.  Rather,  it  is  about 
growing,  transforming,  and  improving,  for  the  benefit 
of  all.  Building  the  resilience  capacity  of  weaker  and 
disadvantaged  sections  of  the  citizenry  is  specifically 
highlighted and runs through most 100RC city strategies.

engineering, design, planning, project management and consulting services 
for all aspects of the built environment. The firm is also a strategy partner for

10

the  Chennai 

resilience  strategy 

also  guides 
to 
operationalize  a  broader  resilience  thinking  that  goes 
beyond  disaster  preparedness  and  recovery  and 
includes  health  and  wellbeing,  economy  and  society, 
infrastructure  and  environment,  and  leadership  and 
strategy as key dimensions of resilience (see Figure 1). 

These dimensions are further divided into 12 drivers (for 
e.g. meeting basic needs, fostering economic prosperity, 
and empowering a broad range of stakeholders) to help
the city assess the implications of shocks and stresses.
The  CRF  also  provides  a  framework  to  assess  how
specific resilience-building actions may strengthen the
four  areas  of  focus  and  the  12  city  resilience  drivers.
Therefore, the Resilient Chennai Strategy assesses the
resilience value of each strategy action using the CRF.

WHAT DOES RESILIENCE MEAN TO CHENNAI 
CITIZENS?

When  Chennai  citizens,  government  officials,  and 
representatives of the private, academic and non-profit 
sectors  were  asked  to  describe  Chennai  as  a  resilient 
city,  responses  were  varied.  Overall,  however,  they 
echoed  a  sentiment  of  accommodating  the  broader, 
deeper,  and  long-term  lens  of  resilience.  Based  on 
a  common  understanding  of  the  socio-political  and 
ecological  concerns  of  the  city,  these  responses  also 
offered  some  additional  insight  into  what  resilience 
building  should  mean  specifically  in  the  context  of 
Chennai. For instance, one running thematic emphasis 
was  on  the  need  to  be  proactive  and  have  foresight, 
both in terms of thinking and action, including around 
urban  planning,  water  systems  management,  and  in 
terms of dealing with vulnerable communities. Another 
key theme that cut across stakeholders’ characterization 
of  resilience-building  in  the  context  of  Chennai  was 
the  need  for  greater  coordination  and  collaboration 
within government and across government and non-
government partners. 

Stakeholder  responses  were  coded  to  reflect  broader 
thematic goals and represented in the form of a word 
cloud (see Figure 3).

< Figure 2: Index Cards from working group workshop

UNPACKING RESILIENCE

Figure 3: Word cloud illustrating stakeholder vision for resilient Chennai

RESILIENT CHENNAI VISION 

The Resilient Chennai Vision is thus a reflection of 100RC’s deeper, broader, and longer-term 
lens and Chennai residents’ call for a proactive, long-sighted, inclusive, and well-coordinated 
approach to dealing with city shocks, and, more importantly, the many stresses that aggravate 
the scale and impact of such shocks (e.g.: the scale of floods aggravated by challenges around 
rampant urbanization, encroachment, and solid waste management).

The vision for Chennai in the new future is ‘Enlightened. Just. Integrated.’ This means city leaders 
and citizens think holistically, ecologically, and with foresight, as well as act proactively and 
smartly to manage and respond to risks and vulnerabilities. They recognize linkages between 
urban, socio-cultural, economic, and environmental development, are sensitive to the needs 
of those who are disadvantaged, and think and plan ahead of time to build city capacity for 
dealing  with  vulnerabilities.  Chennai  will  continue  to  grow  and  will  do  so  by  leveraging  its 
strengths, rather than compromising its environment, and thereby its citizens’ future.

madras to 
chennai: history 
& context

From a cluster of fishing villages to the fourth largest 
metropolitan area in India 

Human  settlements  have  dotted  the  present  day 
Chennai  region  since  ancient  times.  This  is  evidenced 
in  archaeological  material  from  the  Palaeolithic  and 

What’s in a name?

Madras became Chennai in 1996 when cities 
and  addresses  across  India  selected  non-
anglicized names to replace those assigned 
to  them  during  the  British  occupation.  It 
is said that the name 'Chennai' originates 
from  Chennapattinam,  a  region  in  King 
Chandragiri’s empire that was conquered 
by the British. 'Madras', in turn, is said to 
originate  from  Madraspattinam,  a  fishing 
village just north of the British-built Fort 
St.  George.  As  the  Fort  St.  George  area 
expanded  to  absorb  nearby  villages,  the 
developing  town  came  to  be  known  as 
Madraspattinam and eventually Madras to 
the British.

MADRAS TO CHENNAI: HISTORY & CONTExT

Iron  ages,  as  well  as  ancient  manuscripts  and  temple 
inscriptions  from  the  Pallava  and  Chola  periods11,12. 
However, Chennai’s journey to the city it is today began 
with the advent of colonization: the Portuguese in 1522, 
the  Dutch  in  1612,  and  the  British  in  163913,14.  By  this 
description, the city is about 400 years old.  

On  August  22,  1639,  a  local  Nayakiii  ruler  turned  over 
a  tract  of  land  to  the  East  India  Company  for  building 
a  factory  and  warehouse  for  trading  purposes.  The 
land  consisted  primarily  of  fishing  settlements  and 
was  located  near  the  northern  Coromandel  coast15.  In 
1640, the British built Fort St. George which became the 
anchor of this growing colonial city. By the 18th century, 
the British had conquered areas covering present-day 
Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka to form the 
Madras  Presidency,  with  the  emergent  city  of  Madras 
as its capital.

In  1688,  Madras  was  declared  the  first  Municipal 
Corporation  in  the  British  Commonwealth  outside  of 
Britain. Over the next 200 years, Madras urbanized and 
added  a  range  of  infrastructure,  including  railways  (in 
1856), water supply (in 1872), a sewage system (in 1907), 
electric  lighting  (in  1910),  and  electrified  meter  gauge 
railway (in 1928). 

iii The Nayaks were a Telugu speaking royalty who ruled a large part of South 
India, including current areas of North Tamil Nadu, between 1529 and 1736.

An 18th century sketch of Fort St. George | Source: British Library/Wiki 

Between the 1900s and the 1940s, Madras grew from a 
city of 70 sq. km with 540,000 people to a sprawling 80 
sq.  km  with  860,000  people.  The  rate  of  urbanization 
in Madras was significant, particularly when compared 
with  that  of  its  local  Tamil  Nadu  counterpartsiv,  and, 
more broadly, those across South India16,17. This picked 
up additional pace after India’s independence in 194718, 
when  city  boundaries  expanded  to  129  sq.  km  to 
accommodate an annual population growth rate of 2% 
between  1951  to  1961  and  of  3.51%  between  1961  and 
197119. In 1978, the Madras city boundary was once again 
expanded to cover 176 sq. km as a means of managing 
continuing growth20.

iv In 1969, the Madras Presidency was renamed the state of Tamil Nadu.

While under British rule, Chennai city grew into a major 
urban  centre  and  naval  base.  Post-independence 
from  Britain, 
it  continued  to  grow  primarily  as  a 
hub  for  manufacturing  industries.  Today,  Chennai’s’ 
economy  has  expanded  substantially  into  a  service 
and knowledge economy, while continuing to support 
thriving  automobile  and  Information  Technology  (IT) 
industries, which are complemented by the healthcare 
industry, financial services, post-secondary educational 
institutions  and  manufacturing  of  various  types  of 
hardware24.  The  city’s  vibrant  economy  is  qualified 
by  a  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  of  United  States 
Dollar (USD) 58 billion and a 6% growth rate25. Chennai 
has  successfully  positioned  itself  as  a  key  player  in 
the state’s and the country’s economies by producing 
60%  of  India’s  automotive  exports26  and  by  being  the 
largest revenue generator in the ‘software as a service’ 
(SaaS) sector by already earning over USD 500 million 
in revenue so far27.

MADRAS TO CHENNAI: HISTORY & CONTExT

From ecologically driven to economically conscious

Development  in  Madras  early  on  was  largely  guided 
by  topographical  and  hydrological  constraints. 
In 
other  words,  communities  understood  and  respected 
the  environmental  realities  of  their  surroundings  and 
moulded  development  accordingly.  For 
instance, 
to  mitigate  the  risk  of  flooding,  they  concentrated 
their  settlements  in  more  elevated  areas28,29.  Also, 
they  seemed  particularly  ingenious  in  their  handling 
of  local  water  resources.  Recognizing  the  seasonal 
uncertainties of water supply, early settlers built an ery 
system which, till date, remains a fascinating example 
of an efficient engineering and management solution to 
Chennai’s  water  problems.  Typically,  erys  consisted  of 
interconnected  water  bodies/tanks  created  primarily 
to  ensure  water  was  available  to  all  for  irrigation,  but 
also  to  help  in  conservation,  aquifer  recharge,  and 
flood mitigation during times of heavy rainfall30. These 
erys  were  managed  by  a  committee  (known  as  Ery 
Variyam), which was constituted by villagers, and were 
maintained using a dedicated percentage of the gross 
produce of each village31.

This  collective  or  communal  resource  management 
system  was  typical  of  pre-colonial  times  when  large 
tracts  of  land  were  also  collectively  owned32.  The 
poromboke  system  of  land-use  classification,  which 
dates back to the medieval era, designated grasslands, 
groves,  water  bodies,  and  village  forests  as  shared-

use  spaces  (the  term  porom  means  “outside”)33.  The 
distinction  between  public  and  private  was  unclear 
and land as a key economic resource did not factor into 
decision-making processes until British dominance34.

MADRAS TO CHENNAI: HISTORY & CONTExT

Later, following the introduction of western-influenced 
distinctions  between  private  and  public,  with  a 
particular  focus  on  the  monetary/economic  value 
of  land,  poromboke  areas  such  as  wetlands  became 
demarcated  as  “wastelands”,  a  differentiation  method 
that  continues  well  into  the  twentieth  century35,  and 
one that puts ecologically relevant landscapes at risk of 
rampant development and encroachment.

The traditional ery system has also lost its relevance in 
today’s  urbanized  Chennai.  A  growing  population  and 
economy, combined with a booming real estate market, 
mean  that  Chennai’s  water  bodies  including  its  erys 
have been encroached upon or reclassified for housing, 
and  in  some  cases  for  commercial  and  industrial 
developments. Surviving erys are poorly maintained for 
a number of reasons: during the period of British rule, the 
communal resource management system broke down 
when  a  transition  to  centralized  water  management 
structures  (such  as  dams  and  canals)  and  agencies 
(such  as  the  Public  Works  Department  (PWD))  were 
made. The focus on large engineering interventions to 

manage city water flow is apparent in the prioritization 
of  artificial  storm  water  drainage  (SWD)  systems  over 
traditional tanks. In addition, the eventual proliferation 
of unregulated private bore wells and a transition to a 
non-agricultural  economy  has  rendered  the  ery  less 
important as a source of water to citizens.

implementing  sprawling 

The  colonial  period  also  triggered  an  approach  to 
urban  development  that  oriented  the  city  towards 
suburbanization  by 
road 
and  transportation  networks36.  The  1862  British-built 
Royapuram  Railway  Station  is  a  clear  manifestation  of 
this strategy: it induced people to move northwards and 
settle down in the low-lying Royapuram neighbourhood 
where a timber industry had developed. The Royapuram 
railway line also cut through the ecologically sensitive 
swamp  lands  of  Perambur  in  North  Chennai.  Thus, 
people started settling around transportation networks, 
in areas that were traditionally uninhabited37.

The  suburban  expansion  and  development  trend 
into  ecologically  vulnerable  areas  continued  post-

First phase of the Tamil Language 
Movement begins when the 
Congress Party is elected to form 
the State Government at Madras 
Presidency in the first Provincial 
Election held in British India, and 
issued an order in April 1938 making 
Hindi language teaching compulsory 
in all the secondary schools of the 
province.

British rule.

Second phase of Anti-Hindi agitation 
–a temporary solution was designed 
whereby English was to remain the 
official language for fifteen years while 
Hindi would be promoted as national 
language so English could be phased out.

independence,  and  has  especially  been  aggravated 
since India’s economy was liberalized in the early 1990s. 
For instance, the development of Chennai’s IT corridor 
in  the  late  1990s  along  the  Old  Mahabalipuram  Road, 
which  was  supported  by  a  strategic  Government  of 
Tamil Nadu (GoTN) move to leverage IT sector growth 
for economic development, is an example of the city’s 
encroachment into ecologically sensitive areas—in this 
case around the Pallikaranai wetland. Originally spread 
over  6,000  hectares  in  the  1960s,  this  wetland  shrank 
dramatically  over  several  decades  by  approximately 
90%. The result is a compromised ability to perform its 
natural role as sink for excess water during heavy rainfall, 
meaning  that  surrounding  areas,  including  Chennai’s 
newly developed IT corridor, are at risk from perpetual 
flooding.  Recently,  the  Tamil  Nadu  government  has 
begun  to  recognize  the  ecological  importance  of  this 
area,  responding  in  part  to  the  tireless  efforts  of  Care 
Earth, a local non-profit organization which calls for the 
protection  and  restoration  of  ecological  resources.  In 
2007, about 317 hectares of swamp land in Pallikaranai 
was declared a Reserved Forest by the GoTN.

From traditional to cosmopolitan

The fierceness with which Anti-Hindi agitation unfolded 
in  the 
late  1930s  highlights  Tamilians'  pride  and 
attachment  to  their  Tamil  identity  and  fear  of  ‘Hindi 
imperialism’  that  has  dominated  since  before  India’s 
independence38.  The  movement  began  as  opposition 
to  the  introduction  of  compulsory  teaching  of  the 
Hindi  language  in  Madras  Presidency  schools  in  1937. 
The  agitation  lasted  three  years  and  involved  fasts, 
conferences,  marches,  demonstrations,  and  protests. 
The  movement  gained  momentum  again  post-
independence,  while  India’s  constitution  was  being 
drafted,  as  intense  discussions  prevailed  regarding 
Hindi  as  India’s  official  language.  Around  the  1950s,  in 
response  to  relentless  opposition  from  the  South,  a 
temporary solution was designed whereby English was 
to remain India’s official language for fifteen years, while 
Hindi would be promoted as a national language so that 
English could be phased out. However, as Rahman says

(T)his only created a ticking time bomb that
exploded with bloody violence when the time
ran out” (2014)39.

Irrespective of all the development, most locals agree 
that  Chennai  has  always  been  and  still  remains  a 
traditional city—one deeply rooted in its Tamil identity, 
its religions, its cultures, and its art forms. 

In  1965,  it  took  another  round  of  bloody  protests  by 
Tamil  nationalists  to  finally  thwart  the  idea  of  making 
Hindi India’s official language. Even today, locals prefer 
to  speak  with  non-Tamil  speaking  visitors  in  English 
rather than Hindi.

importance  placed  on  the  arts 

Another  example  of 
the  deep-rooted  nature  of 
Chennai  culture  and  identity  is  the  continued  interest 
and 
(particularly 
the  performing  arts  of  music  and  dance).  This 
includes  classical  art  forms  of  Carnatic  music  and 
Bharathanatyam, as well as other forms of music such 
as villupattu, gaana, Tamil sufi music, film music, and folk 
dances such as paraiattam and therukoothu (theatre). 

Several temples in the city including the Thiyagarajaswamy 
temple  in  Thiruvottriyur,  the  Kapaleeshwarar  temple  in 
Mylapore, and the Parthasarathy temple in Thiruvallikeni, 
were  centres  of  music  and  dance,  with  numerous 
tevarams  (verses  on  Lord  Shiva),  pasurams  (verses  on 
Lord Vishnu), and Carnatic music compositions on the 
presiding deities. 

While  music  and  dance  have  now  largely  moved  out 
of temples to auditoria, they continue to be an intrinsic 
part  of  the  Chennai  city  identity.  The  Margazhi  Music 
and  Dance  Festival,  which  is  held  in  the  months  of 
December  and  January,  is  one  of  the  largest  music 
festivals in the world with around 1,500 performances 
spread across the city and only evening performances 
ticketed.  Complementing  this  festival  is  the  Chennai 
Kalai  Theru  Vizha,  which  showcases  multiple  art 
forms through performances across less explored and 
understood parts of the city (such as North Chennai) with 
the intent of “equalizing spaces, cultures, communities, 
and the arts”40. In 2017, these efforts resulted in Chennai 

being included in UNESCO’s list of ‘creative cities’ for its 
contribution to music.

Tied inexorably to Chennai's culture is the Madras tiffin. 
The triumvirate of Tamil Nadu fast food —idly, dosa and 
vadai— is available on every street at prices within the 
means  of  all  citizens.  Heaped  around  these  is  a  host 
of  dishes  whose  fragrances  and  flavours  are  uniquely 
South Indian, not the least of which is a frothy cup of hot 
filter kaapi (coffee).

No story of the Tamil identity is complete without the 
story  of  the  Chennai  Super  Kings,  better  known  as 
CSK,  led  by  the  indomitable  Thala  Dhoni  (as  of  2019). 
In a culture where film stars have been embraced with 
blind faith and revered, Dhoni and his CSK team are no 
longer  cricketers  playing  a  game.  They  are  gladiators 
fighting  for  and  bringing  pride  to  the  Tamils  with  their 
winning  ways.  Across  the  length  and  breadth  of  this 
cricket crazy nation, CSK have put the Tamils firmly and 
truly on top, bringing with them a sense of honour and 
belonging that has seldom been felt or seen in recent 
times.

Nor  is  it  complete  without  discussing  the  Jallikattu 
protests:  In  2017,  the  city  witnessed  strong  protests 
against  a  Supreme  Court  order  banning  the  state’s 
traditional  bull-taming  sport  Jallikattu.  The  largely 
peaceful demonstrations on Marina Beach and at Tidel 
Park  Junction  (on  the  IT  Corridor)  were  predominantly

organised on social media by IT professionals, students, 
and  others  who  turned  it  into  a  celebration  of  Tamil 
pride41. The movement was significant for two reasons: 
a)
it  represented  the  power  of  social  media  and
consequently the adeptness of the city’s young people
with  newer,  modern  technology  to  orchestrate  a  city-
wide  movement;  and  b)  the  increase  in  white  collar
employees,  signalling  a  slow  but  steady  change  from
the ‘traditional’ to the ‘cosmopolitan’.

Chennai’s  journey  from  traditional  to  cosmopolitan 
coincided with significant economic changes that were 
triggered by emerging new industries in IT, IT-enabled 
services, and business process outsourcing industries—
all  of  which  attracted  a  new  labour  force  that  largely 
included skilled middle-income men from outside the 
state.  Migration  trends  from  the  Economic  Survey  of 
India  2016-2017  reveal  that  ‘Delhi,  Maharashtra,  and 
Tamil Nadu attract large swathes of migrants from the 
Hindi  speaking  heartland  of  Uttar  Pradesh,  Bihar,  and 
Madhya Pradesh and the North East. In fact, net railway 
passenger inflows into Chennai district are among the 
highest in the state (see Figure 7).

Migrants from these states do not all work in the IT sector; 
some  also  come  to  join  the  construction  workforce 
while many come to the city to study and generally in 
search  of  better  living  standards.  And  they  bring  with 
them their culture and traditions. Associations such as

welfare of Manipuris, Chennai Mizo Welfare Association, 
and  Neoliberal  Ethos  Centre  help  members  adjust

events and activities43. While these organizations cater 
to  relatively  newer  migrants,  Gujarati  and  Rajasthani 
traders  make  up  some  of  Chennai’s  earlier  migrants; 
they  came  to  the  city  in  the  1600s  to  do  business 
with  the  East  Indian  Company.  Predominantly  money 
lenders, these communities settled around Mint Street, 
an area that came to be known as Sowcarpet (derived 
from  sowcars,  or  money  lenders)44.    Even  today,  this 
area is unique in Chennai for its Rajasthani and Gujarati 
sweets, crafts, and fashions.

Chennai cosmopolitanism is also the result of the city’s 
large automobile industry, which attracts citizens from 
foreign  countries  including  South  Korea,  Germany, 
USA,  France,  and  Japan  to  work  in  their  respective 
automobile companies, which include Hyundai, Daimler, 
BMW,  Ford,  Renault,  and  Mitsubishi.  Expatriates  from 
these countries have set up their own cultural centres, 
including the Inko Centre (India Korean Cultural Centre), 
the  Goethe  Institute,  and  the  Alliance  Française,  all 
of  which  hold  various  activities,  classes,  and  cultural 
events throughout the year. 

Further,  over  the  years,  the  city  has  also  attracted  a 
steady  inflow  of  medical  tourists  from  other  Indian 
states  and  countries 
(East  African  countries  and 
Bangaladesh, in particular). According to a study by the 
Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), Chennai attracts 
nearly 40% of India’s medical tourists, with 200 foreign 
patients coming to the city for treatment every day45.

S. Muthiah concludes his book “Madras Rediscovered”
with the following words:

Madras is the past that’s also catching 
up with the present, where the Bharata 
Natyam dancer is as much at home on 
the Music Academy’s stage as she is in 
the discos that are an established part 
of today’s entertainment scene or the 
sambhar and curd rice connoisseur 
at home is the gourmand in fine 
dining spaces that offer a plethora of 
international cuisine. But for all the 
change, the traditions of a conservative 
past and memories of glorious 
yesterdays remain an intrinsic part of 
the fabric of a city of today drawing up 
great plans for tomorrow” (2018: 545).

During  this  period,  a  communal  system 
of  resource  management  was  typical.  The 
poromboke  system  of  land  use  classification, 
dating  back  to  the  medieval  era,  designated 
grasslands, 
and 
village  forests  as  shared-use  spaces.  The 
traditional erys (interconnected waterbodies/
tanks  created  as  effective  means  of  water 
distribution, 
flood 
mitigation) were also managed collectively by 

groves,  waterbodies 

conservation, 

and 

village communities.

29

With  colonial  rule,  land  and  other  resources 
began  to  be  distinguished  as  public  and  private, 
primarily based on property ownership rights and 
with  particular  focus  on  the  monetary/economic 
value. Hence, poromboke areas such as wetlands 
began  to  be  demarcated  as  “wastelands”,  a 
practice  that  continued  until  recently,  putting 
these  ecologically  relevant  landscapes  at  risk 
of  rampant  development  and  encroachment. 
Development and expansion into low-lying areas 
and ecologically sensitive zones began with almost 
3,482  waterbodies  being  transferred  to  built-up 

areas during this time.

The trend in rampant growth, often at the cost 
of  environmental  sustainability  continued,  and 
even accelerated with the economic liberalization 
in  the  1990s  and  the  IT  sector  development  in 
particular. While the 2004 Tsunami was a wake- 
up  call  for  the  city  to  begin  thinking  about  its 
resilience  to  future  shocks,  the  2015  floods 
managed to raise wider awareness regarding the 
human contribution to such natural occurrences. 
As an activist explained, the “2015 flood was in 
the  making  for  decades,”  as  the  city  built  over 
and violated the natural ecosystem in pursuit of 

growth and development.

Recognizing 
the  city’s 
development  and  the  environmental  shocks  and 
stresses, especially related to water, the city has begun 
to  focus  on  restoring  its  waterbodies  and  removing 
encroachments,  both  for  environmental  protection 
and  public  safety.  Multi-lateral/bilateral 
funding 
agencies are investing in the water sector to build the 
city’s  capacity  to  meet  citizens'  water  demand  and  to 
reduce  the city’s vulnerability to floods and droughts. 
While  the  GoTN  is  contemplating  eight-fold  expansion 
of  the  metropolitan  area  to  accommodate  Chennai’s 
growth, it is emphasizing the need to plan this growth 
in  an  integrated  fashion  linking  economic,  social,  and

 Figure 8: Unplanned and unhealthy urbanization: the anchor in Chennai’s resilience challenges story

From  a  cluster  of  16th  century  fishing  villages  to  the 
fourth largest metropolitan city and economy in India, 
recognized  for  its  world  class  medical  facilities  and 
software services, Chennai has come a long way. Like 
all other rapidly expanding metropolitan cities, Chennai 
also  has  its  share  of  resilience  challenges:  the  city 
frequently endures shocks such as floods and cyclones, 
while  coping  with  chronic  stresses  such  as  droughts, 
poor  waste  management,  encroachment, 
traffic 
congestion,  and  pollution.  Drawing  on  stakeholder 
feedback on Chennai’s resilience challenges, five areas 
stand out:

 ⊗ rapid and unplanned urbanization;
 ⊗ poor water systems; 
 ⊗ disaster risks;
 ⊗ poor governance ecosystem; 
 ⊗ and disadvantaged vulnerable communities.

While each of these areas is intricately connected with 
the  other,  the  overall  story  of  Chennai’s  resilience 
challenges does appear to be firmly anchored in the 
process by which it has urbanized: a process that has 
been rampant, unplanned, and unhealthy.

led  to  governance  challenges  across  all  urban  and

multi-stakeholder  participation  in  planning  has  led  to 
impact on the city’s poor and other vulnerable groups 
who are exposed to higher risks on all fronts.

CHENNAI’S UNPLANNED 
AND UNHEALTHY 
URBANISATION TREND

A  description  of  Chennai’s  urbanisation  trend  helps 
portray  the  gamut  of  the  city’s  socio-environmental 
challenges and their inter-linkages. Driven by population 
growth, economic transition, and development, the city 
has been experiencing urban land use expansion at an 
unprecedented rate. A 2009 study46 assigned Chennai 
37th place in the list of largest urban areas in the world 
(see  Figure  9  for  decadal  growth  rate  and  population 
increase  in  Chennai).  To  accommodate  the  rapidly 
increasing population, the Greater Chennai Corporation 

(GCC)  expanded  its  jurisdiction  to  426  sq.  km  in  2011, 
prior to which it covered an area of 174 sq. km. Currently, 
the state government is considering a further expansion 
of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) to nearly eight 
times its current size (from 1,189 sq. km to 8,878 sq. km).

While  there  have  been  master  plans  to  shape  the 
growth, these have not been effective or well thought 
through, aggravating the natural and man-made shocks 
and  stresses  the  city  experiences,  including  floods,

pollution,  and  encroachment.  Prior  to  1975,  Chennai 
city did not have a comprehensive master plan47,48,v. As 
the city needed to accommodate more people and the 
need  for  associated  infrastructure  increased,  natural 
areas were constructed upon, without attention to the 
functions  of  those  ecosystems  or  to  the  long-term 
impact  of  losing  them,  including  the  impact  of  losing 
their function in mitigating city disaster risks (see Figure 
10 for CMA land use change).

The  1970s  and  1980s  saw  ‘development  of  lakes’ 
through  the  “Ery  Schemes”,  whereby  the  Tamil  Nadu 
Housing  Board  (TNHB)  filled  up  dry  lakes  in  order  to 
accommodate  housing  schemes 
in  Ambattur  and 
Mogappair. These schemes, which were funded by the 
World Bank, also included the construction of markets 
and  the  development  of  bus  stands49.  In  the  2000s, 

several slums were relocated from within the city to its 
outer  limits  on  the  banks  of  the  Pallikaranai  Marsh  in 
Perumbakkam and Semmancheri. Accompanying these 
changes  were  land  re-classifications  which  further 
affected  fragile  ecosystems 
including  the  Ennore 
creek,  which  was  earmarked  for  the  development  of 
hazardous  waste  industries.  Further,  expansion  of  the 
Kamaraj Port into Chennai’s salt pans and Ennore creek 
led to the dumping of fly ash in the area by TANGEDCO, 
the Tamil Nadu Government Electricity Generation and 
Distribution  Company.  Data  on  land-reclassification 
from 2008 to 2017 also indicates that 250.576 hectares 
of  agricultural  land  were  converted  to  accommodate 
residential  and  other  development—which  accounts 
for 42.64% of total land use conversion in Chennai50 (see 
Figure 11).

v Prior to that, General Town Planning Scheme (1957), Madras Interim Plan (1967), Madras Metropolitan Plan (1971-1991), and Madras Urban Development 
Project (1974) were a few of the schemes that governed urban planning in the city.

CHENNAI'S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES

Urban  planning  needs  to  integrate  information  on 
environmental  shocks  and  stresses  and/or  measures 
to  address  them  more  pro  actively.  In  fact,  reliable 
multi-hazard  maps  are  still  unavailable  to 
inform 
planning. Flood prone areas were marked only post the 
December, 2015 flooding event. Environmental shocks 
and  stresses  such  as  floods  or  climate  change  and 
associated sea-level rise are generally not recognised 
as key or urgent issues that need to be considered in 
urban  planning  discussions.  Even  as  mean  sea  levels 
are projected to rise between 0.19m and 1.2m54 over the 
next  few  decades,  major  infrastructure  development 
along the coast continues, including desalination plants, 
ports,  and  industry.  This  highlights  a  need  to  raise 
awareness  around  the  urgency  to  plan  for  a  climate 
adaptive  city.  Similarly,  protecting  the  city’s  blue  and 
green  infrastructure  for  long-term  sustainability  also 
needs to be prioritized in the city’s planning paradigm. 

Informed and environmentally responsible planning, by 
using sustainable building practices, could improve the 
ability of structures to withstand floods or earthquakes. 
Porous pavements can improve groundwater recharge 
while  also  reducing  surface  run-off  during  flooding 
events.  Thus,  by  adopting  a  proactive  and  integrated 
approach  to  urban  planning,  the  city  can  mainstream 
environmental  thinking  into  urban  development  and 
better  address  Chennai’s  socio-environmental  shocks 
and stresses.

Urban planning has also been unsuccessful in tackling 
the city’s solid waste and sanitation issues effectively. An 
early 100RC survey indicates solid waste management 
(SWM) and sewage as high impact challenges. Several 
experts  across  government  and  non-government 
agencies agree that mismanaged solid waste was one 
factor that contributed to major flooding in 2015, when

Since we do not have flood 
mapping in the area, whenever 
planning permission comes to 
build a building or layout of 
land, we refer the case to PWD’s 
WRD… In the 2015 flood we did 
not have adequate manpower, 
time, and could not access 
majority of areas. So, with 
limited staff, we could not map 
out the impact.”

-- CMDA Interview, 17 Oct 2018

This  land  conversion  highlights  not  just  the  loss  of 
agricultural  and  natural  land  that  serves  important 
ecological functions, but also means a loss of livelihood 
for  farmers.  Without  adequate  safeguards,  such  land-
use  conversion  will  pose  increasing  threat  to  food 
security, as well as to farmer livelihoods in areas around 
the  city,  because  land  price  increases  will  force  them 
to sell their agricultural land to real estate developers.

Development on or too close to lakes and rivers has led 
to  a  loss  of  water  bodies  and  encroachment  on  flood 
plains.  This  has  compromised  the  ecosystem  balance 
that  the  traditional  ery  system  maintained  as  a  flood 
mitigating  mechanism,  and  exposed  communities, 
especially  the  poor  living  along  waterways,  to  regular 
flood  risk52,53,  which  is  not  just  limited  to  episodes  of 
heavy rainfall; flooding occurs around Chennai following 
brief episodes of rainfall as well.

Solid waste management (SWM)

Citizens  have  also  made  efforts  to  manage  solid 
waste  within  their  communities.  Resident  Welfare 
Associations  (RWAs)  such  as  the  one  in  Manali, 
segregate  100%  of  their  waste  due  to  active 
participation 
from  the  residents.  With  greater 
support — both technical and political — from the 
GCC, these RWAs and others could do even better 
at SWM.

waste choked SWD and waterways, causing large-scale 
inundation.  In  fact,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  floods,  the 
GCC had to remove 1.32 million tonnes of garbage that 
was  strewn  across  the  city,  which  amounts  to  almost 
25  days’  worth  of  waste55.  The  issue  of  solid  waste 
in  Chennai  is  an  outcome  of  collective  neglect  and 
mismanagement—by  both  government  and  citizens—
and  therefore  needs  strict  action  on  everyone’s  part. 
However, recent developments such as steps taken by 
the  GCC  to  redefine  solid  waste  management  vendor 
contracts  and  to  ban  the  manufacture,  sale,  and  use 
of  plastics  indicate  intent  to  tackle  the  issue  more 
seriously.

Chennai citizens also point to traffic as a key challenge in 
an early Resilient Chennai surveyvi, 56. The root cause of 
this issue is poor planning, road infrastructure problems, 
and  inadequate  public  transportation  services,  and 
is  especially  problematic  in  peri-urban  areas.  A  2018 
Centre for Science and Environment report states that 
Chennai citizens have the longest daily commutes. As a 
result, the city ranks second among all Indian metros in 
overall energy consumption and carbon emissions. The 
study also reveals that Chennai has the highest number 
of two-wheelers among all metro cities57.

Middle-class  dependence  on  private 
(including  motor  bikes),  which  contributes  to  traffic, 
pollution, and climate change in the long run, is largely 
a  function  of  insufficient  last-mile  connectivity  in  the 
public transport system58. Another cause is insufficient

not  pedestrian-friendly,  and  do  not  accommodate 
concerns  related  to  non-motorized  vehicles.  A  lack  of 
dedicated  spaces  for  vendors,  pedestrians,  parking, 
etc.,  lead  to  congested,  unsafe,  and  unwalkable  city 
spaces. Chennai ranks low among Asian cities in terms 
of walkability: one 2011 index gives it an average of 40 
out of 10059.  However, Chennai did win a Sustainia Award 
in 2015 for efforts to improve sustainable transport. The 
award was presented by the Danish think tank Sustainia 
and recognizes a comprehensive approach to improving 
sustainable transport across the world. 

Sustainable  transport  systems  require  state-of-the-
art  public  transportation  that  is  accessible,  affordable, 
convenient, safe, and green. Chennai’s public transport 
system  is  considered  one  of  the  best  in  the  country 
with  four  modes  of  transport:  buses,  metro  rail,  sub-
urban  railway  and  the  mass-rapid  transport  system. 
However,  Chennai  residents  prefer  buses  to  other 
forms  of  public  transport.  In  2015-16,  Chennai’s  buses 
carried  approximately  1,300  passengers  per  bus  per 
day, which is the highest number in the country60. Yet 
the city's bus fleet is one of the oldest in the country61, 
which  increases  the  risk  of  accidents,  and  makes 
access  difficult  for  disabled  and  elderly  passengers, 
since older buses are higher up off the ground and do 
not  include  extendable  steps.  The  government  has 
worked  to  improve  access  and  recently  (in  January, 
2019)  introduced  56  new  buses  which  are  relatively 
disabled-friendly. While physical accessibility on buses 
is  critical  to  improve  ridership,  ensuring  affordability 
is  equally  important.  Passenger  counts  fell  sharply 
from  4.6m  to  3.3m  in  2018  as  a  result  of  a  fare  hike62.  

Such hikes impact vulnerable communities in particular, 
including  those  who  have  been  resettled  into  peri-
urban areas, far away from their work places63.

Finally, 
limited  coordination,  collaboration,  and 
inclusivity  in  urban  planning  processes  pose  a  major 
threat,  particularly  to  vulnerable  citizens.  The  Tamil 
Nadu  (TN)  Vision  2023,  the  Second  Master  Plan,  and 
the city development plan (submitted under Jawaharlal 
Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM)), 
all  highlight  the  importance  of  broad  stakeholder 
engagement 
in  planning  and  decision-making 
processes. However, experts point to the limitations of 
the  commonly  used  public  hearing  and  consultation 
mechanisms  to  truly  include  multiple  voices64.    For 
instance,  a  7.5-km  elevated  beach  expressway 
was  proposed  in  2008  as  a  solution  to  the  problem 
of  congestion  in  the  city.  It  would  have  extended 
from  Marina  Beach  to  the  East  Coast  Road  (ECR)  in 
Kottivakkam. Further, the proposed expressway would 
cut  through  ecologically  sensitive  areas  such  as  the 
Adyar estuary and beaches along the east coast which 
provide  nesting  sites  for  the  endangered  Olive  Ridley 
turtles.  It  would  have  also  run  through  coastal  fishing 
villages  and  displaced  more  than  100,000  people65,66. 
Chennai’s fisher folk have been successful at thwarting 
some of these government designs, arguing that they 
pose livelihoods-related concerns. However, the same 
communities have been unable to stop private parties 
from  grabbing  large  portions  of  coastal  “poromboke” 
lands  for  urban  development.  This  illustrates  why 
broader  stakeholder  involvement  in  decision-making 
processes is crucial to protect varied interests.

Overall,  development  pressure  and  a  prioritization 
of 
immediate  needs  and  economic  aspirations 
predominate  planning  in  Chennai  and  this  has  taken 
a toll in terms of sustainable city growth as well as on 
the needs of the vulnerable. What is lacking is holistic 
planning that is sensitive to economic, ecological, and 
social needs.

CHENNAI’S WATER 
SYSTEMS AT RISK

The Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply 
and Sewage Board (CMWSSB) have the 
capacity  to  supply  830  million  litres  a 
day  (MLD)  through  its  piped  network. 
However, the actual amount supplied is 
lower. For example, just 650 MLD was 
supplied in February, 2018. This is not 
just  below  capacity  but  also  far  below 
the supply benchmark of 135 litres per 
capita per day (lpcd)67. 

41

Chennai  water  bodies  well  exemplify 
the  city’s 
problematic  urbanization  trajectory.  The  development 
of  roads,  houses,  and  industries  over  and  in  close 
proximity  to  lakes  and  rivers  has,  on  the  one  hand, 
compromised the city’s ability to meet its water needs, 
and on the other, exposed citizens to frequent flooding. 
Flooding  risk  has  further  been  aggravated  by  solid 
waste  and  sewage  dumping  into  water  bodies.  This 
paradoxical  situation  involving  either  too  much  or  too 
little water, experts believe, results from a failure during 
planning to consider the water system holistically. Thus, 
in  designing  city  SWDs,  the  focus,  until  recently,  has 
been  on  the  single  purpose  of  alleviating  the  impact 
of  floods,  while  ignoring  the  fact  that  drains  can  play 
equally  important  twin  roles  in  a)  directing  water  to 
drain  into  reservoirs  so  it  can  be  stored  for  later  use, 
and  b)  allowing  it  to  filter  into  the  ground  to  recharge 
depleting aquifers.

As in most Indian cities, Chennai’s piped water supply is 
at present intermittent, and available for just a few hours 
a day (or on alternate days), irrespective of the amount of 
rainfall. Households and commercial/industrial parties 
therefore depend heavily on a private water market, or 
on own bore wells that they themselves sink—both of 
which lead to over exploitation of ground water. 

City  water  shortages  and  an  anticipated  increase 
in  water  demand  have  pushed  Chennai  to  invest  in 
desalination plants. Investments are likely for two new 
plants: one with a capacity of 150 MLD in Nemmeli and 
another with a capacity of 400 MLD in Perur68. Despite 

high  financial  and  environmental  costs,  desalination 
plants present an immediate solution to water scarcity. 
Following  the  2015  floods,  more  attention  is  also 
being  paid  to  restoring  and  protecting  water  bodies 
as  a  means  to  enhancing  future  supply  (for  example, 
the  Sustainable  Water  Security  Mission).  However, 
ecologically  restoring  waterways  and  water  bodies  is 
a complex solution that requires addressing a range of 
issues including solid waste and sewage disposal, and 
legal and illegal encroachments.

Interestingly,  water  experts  across  government  and 
non-government institutions highlight the importance of 
demand management more than source augmentation 
or supply side solutionsvii. This is in line with India’s 2012 
National  Water  Policy,  which  advocates  for  a  demand 
driven  approach  to  water  efficiency  and  states  that 
“recycling  and  reuse  of  water  should  be  the  general 
norm and water pricing should ensure its efficient use, 
and reward conservation”69.

Resilience building in Chennai includes a need for water 
conservation.  Metering  to  measure  consumption  and 
effective  pricing  are  the  most  direct  ways  to  manage 
demand and encourage users to conserve water70,71.

However, the extent of water metering in Chennai today 
is less than 10%72. This dearth of water meters not only 
makes consumption-based pricing impossible, but also 
has  implications  for  another  demand  management 
technique: reducing non-revenue water (NRW) or water

lost  due  to  bad  piping  infrastructure,  theft,  and  illegal 
water  usage73.  On  average,  non-revenue  water  (NRW) 
accounts for around 20% of water produced in Chennai74. 
Also, effective pricing is extremely difficult to implement 
in Indian households, as they are accustomed to paying 
extremely low tariffs for water, and are averse to water 
metering  and  consumption-based  pricing75.  Any  small 
change in price thus requires public approval to avoid 
political  costs  associated  with  the  changes.    A  pilot 
attempt  to  introduce  metering  in  Anna  Nagar  in  2008 
had  to  be  abandoned  for  several  reasons,  including 
already  existing  water  quality  and  water  pressure 
related  issues,  logistical  issues  in  fixing  water  meters, 
and political blow-back as a result of the substantially 
higher monthly water tariffs76,77.  

Like  efficient  pricing,  recycling  waste  water  in  the 
Indian context also presents multiple challenges. One 
relates  to  institutionalizing  recycling  and  reuse  in  the 
existing  centralized  structure,  where  less  than  30% 
of  sewage  from  households  is  actually  collected78. 
The  other  relates  to  popular  acceptance.  In  Chennai, 
cultural  rejection  due  to  the  so-called  “yuck  factor” 
of  using  recycled  sewage  is  often  mentioned  as  a 
primary  obstacle  to  mandating  recycling  water  at  the 
household  level,  although  a  recent  survey  conducted 
by  the  Resilient  Chennai  team  proved  the  contrary  – 
that  citizens  are  willing  to  support  government  policy 
on recycling for household purposes.

Compared  with  waste  water  recycling,  Chennai  has 
been  more  successful  at  implementing  rain  water 
harvesting (RWH) as a measure to conserve fresh water 
at the household level. However, a recent review of the 
city’s  RWH  system  reveals  that  RWH  implementation

In  a  recent  survey  conducted  by  the  100RC  team 
with  residents  from  across  the  city,  60%  of  the 
518  respondents  said  that  water  is  reasonably 
priced. 51% of 543 respondents are willing to pay 
a higher price for water, if it is 24x7 and of higher

Water Recycling

In  a  recent  survey  with  Chennai  residents,  more 
than 55% of respondents were willing to consider 
using waste water recycled by the government for 
domestic purposes in future. While describing the 
reason for their decision to use or not use recycled 
waste  water  only  ~11%  chose  the  ‘yuck  factor’, 
contradicting  what  is  often  believed  to  be  the 
primary detriment to recycling.

was  actually  rushed,  and  the  systems  were  poor  and 
malfunctioning. Currently, around 50% of RWH structures 
are believed to be functional and the ordinance is not 
being monitored or enforced effectively79.

Another  barrier  to  conserving  fresh  water 
is  the 
poor  monitoring  and  enforcement  of  restrictions  on 
groundwater extraction by end-users, as result of which 
the  city’s  groundwater  table  is  depleting  between  10 
cm  and  20  cm  every  year,  approximately80.  The  1987 
Chennai  Metropolitan  Area  Groundwater  (Regulation) 
Act obligates obtaining permission and licenses to sink 
wells,  and  to  extract  or  use  or  transport  groundwater. 
The  rules  do  not  apply  to  domestic  users.  However, 
monitoring  and  enforcement  of  this  regulation 
is 
poor.  Since  illegal  ground  water  extractors  face  no 
consequences,  hardly  any  new  permit  requests  have 
been  received  or  permissions  granted  by  CMWSSB 
since 1996 (CMWSSB, interview, 2018).

In  sum,  the  current  state  of  Chennai’s  water  system 
is 
inefficient  due  to  poor  public 
management  and  planning  as  well  as  a  lack  of  civic 

inadequate  and 

responsibility.  This  poor  state  of  water  systems  also 
explains  why  the  two  most  frequently  experienced 
disasters in Chennai (those that are natural but aggravated 
by  man-made  processes)  are  water-related:  floods  and 
droughts.

CYCLONE            FLOOD

TSUNAMI           DROUGHT

In  addition  to  floods  and  droughts,  Chennai  is  also  at 
risk  of  earthquakes  (according  to  the  National  Centre 
for  Seismology,  Ministry  of  Earth  Sciences,  the  city 
is  classified  under  Zone  IIIviii)    and  the  related  risk  of 
tsunamis.  Nuclear  accidents  are  another  risk  due  to 
Chennai’s  proximity  to  Kalpakkam  Nuclear  Power 
Station.

As a coastal city at a low elevation (averaging 6.7 meters

Chennai  has  always  been  vulnerable  to  storm  surges 
and  floods  during  times  of  heavy  rainfall.  However, 
climate change related sea-level rise (projected to be 
1.3mm  per  year  along  India’s  east  coast)81,  intensified 
cyclones, and changing rainfall patterns seem to have 
exposed  Chennai  to  frequent  droughts  and  higher 
flooding risk from both the coastal and the inland sides82  
(see  Figure  15).  Interestingly,  while  Chennai  floods 
attract  more  attention  from  government,  citizens,  and 
the media, the city is actually more prone to droughts.

1985

Crossing near Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, with a 
maximum wind speed of 80-90 km/hr, the 1985 
cyclone triggered heavy rains. Chennai received 650 
mm in 3 days and 900 mm in total. It was one of the 
greatest flood events in Chennai's history as the 
rains caused the Adyar river to flood with a water 
flow of 1784.16 m3/s (63,000 cusecs) and submerged 
the encroached flood plains.

Chennai received incessant rain during 
this year. It is recorded as one of the few 
catastrophic floods which caused heavy 
damages. The flood submerged some of 
the residential colonies along the flood 
plain of Adyar river.

Chennai received more than 700 mm of 
rainfall over three continuous days. It also 
registered a record-breaking high (at that 
time) of 17.4 cm in 24 hours (surpassed 
by the 2005 floods). The heavy rainfall 
caused flooded roads, electricity was cut 
off and people were marooned at home

improvements in ground water levels till September 
2005, resulting in drinking water scarcity in Chennai 
and other parts of the state. The droughts were so 
severe that domestic water supply through pipelines 
was stopped in Chennai, with the city switching to

BOXING DAY TSUNAMI

A series of high and long sea waves hit the coast of 
India's southern peninsular on 26th December 2004. 
The sea waves were caused by an earthquake of 9.0 
magnitude originating off the west coast of Great 
Sumatra (3.29°N and 95.94°E), Indonesia with a focal 
depth of 30 km. While the earthquake did not cause 
any damage to the mainland of India, it triggered 
a massive tsunami that impacted the entire south 
eastern coast. 

Coastal communities in Chennai were inundated with 
waves up to 30m high. The tsunami caused severe 
damage to 25 kuppams in 4 coastal revenue villages, 
affected 73,000 people and resulted in evacuation of 
30,000. Around 206 human lives were lost, 9 injured 
and 17,000 houses damaged, apart from other 
property. The government undertook immediate 
relief measures to assist families that lost family 
members and who were homeless.

Cyclonic storm 'Fanoos' made landfall as a deep 
depression near Vedaranyam, on December 10th, 
2005. Wind speeds reached a maximum of 50-60 km/
hr. Damage was not significant in Chennai because the 
cyclone weakened on landfall to a deep depression and 
later, a low pressure.

The city and state received unprecedented heavy 
rains during the northeast monsoon from November-
December. Chennai city received 35% more than the 
normal average rainfall. This resulted in flooding 
throughout the city and its suburbs. It was reported 
that 16 human lives were lost, 2525 huts - damaged 
completely and 47996 huts - partially damaged. During 
the months of November-December city life was 
disrupted multiple times due to several spells of heavy 
rainfall. The city was back to normalcy only after 10 
days from the last spell of rainfall on 4th December 
2005.  The state government estimated Rs.13684.16 Cr

city  including  the  airport,  major  train  stations,  and 
roads—disconnecting  the  city  and  marooning  citizens 
without supply of food, water, medicines, and electricity 
for days. The floods also had particular impact on the 
newly  developed  residential  and  commercial  areas 
along Chennai’s southerly IT corridor, which is situated 
on and near the Pallikaranai Marshland.

It  took  more  than  a  week  to  restore  normalcy  and 
essential services, and over a month to carry out relief 
measures.  Among  the  most  affected  were  the  poor 
and  vulnerable,  living  in  informal  settlements  along 
waterways  or  in  public  tenements  located  in  flood 
prone areas, and the small business enterprises. Many 
small businesses were affected to such an extent that 
they were unable to restart their work92.

Post floods in 2015, a strong realization emerged among 
Chennai-ites  about  the  need  for  consistent  efforts  to 
remain prepared for such events, with special attention 
required for the needs of the poor, and those who live in

Such  preparedness 
involves  building  community 
capacity to cope with disasters while also strengthening 
government  ability  to  provide  relief  to  citizens  in  an

technical/scientific  and  sociological  data  available  on 
different types of disaster risks, their spatial character, 
most  vulnerable  communities,  nature  of  vulnerability 
etc. limit the city’s ability to remain prepared.

In  2018,  the  State  Disaster  Management  Perspective 
Plan was prepared; it focuses on pre-disaster activities 
and 
takes  a  multi-hazard  approach.  Many  city 
officials  agree  that  the  city  plan  which  was  updated

addition to focusing on floods, it also needs to recognize 
risks related to droughts and storm surges.

FLOODS

The city of Chennai and its suburbs recorded multiple torrential 
rainfall events during the annual north-easter in November-
December 2015 that caused severe flooding throughout the city. 
The maximum rainfall recorded was 319.60mm which is the highest 
ever record on a single day. The floods claimed approximately 
470 lives and destroyed 4.92 lakh houses in the entire state. 
While Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Assocham valued 
economic losses at Rs. 15,000 Cr, the state government estimated 
Rs.25,912.45 Cr for relief and restoration. It took more than a week 
to restore normalcy of essential services. 100% electricity supply 
was restored only after two weeks and relief and restoration work 
continued during the entire month of December.

DROUGHT

Chennai city and surrounding areas have faced monsoon 
deficits from 2016 through 2018. The rainfall deficit 
in 2016 was 62% over the state of TN, while in 2018, 
deficit ranged between 19% and 59%. This has led the 
State government to declare a drought in Chennai, 
Kanchipuram and Thiruvallur in March 2019. All four 
reservoirs supplying water to Chennai have almost 
dried up. Sources such as Veeranam lake and stone 
quarries from Kanchipuram and Thiruvallur district are 
being used to augment supply. The State government 
sanctioned Rs. 40 Cr to CMWSSB to combat water 
shortage. A large part of this was used to arrange for 
drinking water supply through lorries, drilling of new 
bore wells, and hiring of agricultural wells.

with a speed of more than 140 km/hr. The average rainfall recorded 
was 119.10 mm. An estimated 12 people lost their lives while 
13,578 people were affected by the storm. Industries estimated a 
loss of $1 billion (Rs. 6749 Cr). GCC's disaster report assessment 
further recorded that immense damage was caused to avenue 
trees, roads, street lights, electricity installations and storm water 
drains. The state government estimated INR 22,573 Cr for relief

Three consecutive rain-deficit years 2011, 2012 
and 2013 and the delayed onset of the south 
west monsoon in 2014 created a drought-like 
situation in several parts of the State. Chennai 
managed its water supply without reducing 
the quantity supplied by augmenting through 
sources such as the desalination plants and the 
Veeranam lake. The city received normal rainfall 
during the northeast monsoon 2014 bringing an

CHENNAI'S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES

is,  at  present, 
Chennai’s  governance  structure 
characterized  by  multiple  agencies  with  overlapping 
jurisdictions  and  unclear  role 
responsibilities  and 
assignments.  For 
instance,  while  CMWSSB  uses 
reservoirs/tanks  to  supply  water  to  Chennai  citizens, 
these tanks are owned by PWD which means CMWSSB 
depends  on  PWD  to  clean/desilt  these  reservoirs 
efficiently. Further, old village revenue maps —available 
with the PWD— show that all water bodies and natural 
drainage  channels  were  not  incorporated  into  the 
Second  Master  Plan,  which  is  the  primary  planning 
document  for  the  Chennai  Metropolitan  Area  (CMA). 
Instead,  the  Second  Master  Plan  includes  maps  that 
mark  substantial  sections  of  these  water  bodies  and 
natural channels for “other uses”, which in turn makes it 
difficult to protect them.

These examples highlight the degree of, and need for 
coordination  and  collaboration  between  agencies  to 
enable  efficient  water  management  in  the  city.  In  the 
absence of strong institutional mechanisms to support 
such coordination this becomes a major challenge.

Besides  limited  inter-  and  intra-agency  interaction 
and  data  sharing,  Chennai’s  fragmented  institutional 
structure  is  also  characterized  by  frequent  change  in 
leadership. For instance, the Managing Director position 
at CMWSSB has been held by seven bureaucrats since 
2011.  The  frequent  transfer  of  Indian  Administrative 
Service  (IAS)  officials  to  different  portfolios  affects 
continuity and compromises long-term planning within 
agencies.  In  addition,  a  predominance  of  para-statalx 
agencies,  and  the  continued  state-level  presence 

in  urban  decision  making  on  a  significant  scale,  also 
poses  limits  on  empowering  local-level  governance 
structures, which are expected to be more committed 
to local needs.  

Another  key  challenge  for  Chennai  relates  to  the 
current system’s capacity to enforce and monitor rules 
and  regulations.  While  the  GoTN  and  the  GCC  have 
enacted  several  regulations  relevant  to  managing 
urban  development  and  protecting  environmental 
resources  and  human  lives,  the  extent  to  which  these 
are  implemented  needs  to  be  strengthened.  Some 
crucial but poorly enforced regulations include the Solid 
Waste  Management  Rules,  2016,  the  Amendments  to 
Section 215 (a) of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities 
Act, 1920, and the Building Rules, 1972 (which makes it

x Para-statal agencies are usually set up at the state level and tasked with a specific purpose/area of municipal governance (such as water and/or sanitation)

CHENNAI'S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES

RESILIENCE OPPORTUNITY

Civic Engagement

A large potential exists within Chennai in the form of 
a growing student population, an active battalion of 
RWAs (although they predominantly represent the 
middle-class), and non-profit organizations. Some 
of them specifically voice the needs of vulnerable 
groups, such as Information and Resource Centre 
for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC), Pen 
Urimai Iyyakkam, and the North Chennai Christian 
Network. Potential also exists among corporations 
who can make Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
contributions.  This  potential  is  not  fully  tapped 
but  will  need  to  be,  to  ensure  future  resilience 
in  Chennai’s  governance  system.  Facilitating 
mechanisms are needed for these groups to come 
together, share, co-plan, and co-benefit alongside 
public agencies.

organizations,  or  citizens  in  general,  but  are  populated 
instead by executive members. This does not automatically 
guarantee devolution of power to the people.

Such  institutional  limitations  pose  major  roadblocks  for 
citizens  who  want  to  take  control  of  or  engage  with  city 
decision-making processes. Also, another major roadblock 
relates to citizen awareness, responsibility, willingness, and 
trust that they can make a difference. Irrespective of public 
efforts,  building  resilience  is  bound  to  be  challenging 
in  a  city  of  8.65  million  people  without  their  support  or 
involvement.  

In  a  citizen  survey  of  478  respondents  conducted  by 
Resilient  Chennai,  66%  vouched  that  there  was  ample 
scope for citizens to engage with government and 93% said 
there  is  a  need  for  citizens  to  engage  with  government, 
and showed interest in learning about the city’s functions, 
civic  issues,  and  in  contributing.  However,  almost  60% 
of  survey  respondents  said  they  do  not  actually  interact 
with  government  at  all.  Respondents  who  do  interact  do 
so  mostly  through  local  organizations  and  RWAs.  Many 
were  unaware  of  available  avenues  for  engaging  with 
government  such  as  telephone  helplines,  online  portals, 
and the Namma Chennai mobile app, which can be used 
for  lodging  complaints  and  seeking  redressal.  Survey 
results showed that about 84% of the 478 respondents do 
not use the Namma Chennai app.

Furthermore,  77%  of  respondents  did  not  interact  with 
ward  or  zonal  level  staff,  and  a  similar  percentage  of

mandatory for all buildings to provide RWH structures), 
the  Coastal  Regulation  Zone  Notification,  2011,  and 
the  Chennai  Metropolitan  Area  (CMA)  Groundwater 
(Regulation)  Act,  1987  (amendment  made  in  2002). 
As  these  regulations  are  not  sufficiently  enforced, 
the  city  faces  certain  perennial  problems  including 
poorly managed waste disposal, pollution, water body 
encroachment,  groundwater  resource  over-extraction, 
and a loss of biodiversity. Public departments, in turn, 
face enforcement and regular monitoring challenges in 
terms of capacity, finance, and human resources.

In  any  case, 
irrespective  of  resource  availability, 
government  alone  cannot  run  a  city  effectively 
without  strong  collaboration  from  public  agencies, 
private  entities,  and  citizens.  While  Chennai  has 
several  well-established  industrial,  academic,  non-
profit,  and  technical  institutions,  interaction  across 
these,  and  between  them  and  the  public,  remains 
limited94.  Engaging  the  public 
in  decision-making 
processes has also been relatively weak. For instance, 
public  consultations,  the  most  common  institutional 
mechanism  through  which  citizens  are 
invited  to 
engage with the state, is more often than not used as a 
platform for providing feedback or grievance redressal, 
rather  than  active  participation  in  decision-making 
processes95.  Partly  due  to  lack  of  time  and  partly  to 
avoid major contestations, such consultations are in fact 

organized but not sufficiently advertised, and often held 
in  locations  that  are  hard  for  relevant  stakeholders  to 
access.  For instance, a public consultation for restoring 
the  Buckingham  Canal  was  scheduled  for  a  weekday, 
with  one  day’s  notice.  The  consultation  was  attended 
by around 30 people, most of whom were government 
officials.  The  remaining  attendees  were  a  few  college 
students  from  nearby  colleges  who  reportedly  were 
asked to join at the last moment to increase the crowd 
size96.

While  the  73rd  and  74th  Constitutional  Amendment 
Acts  of  1992  and  1993  provides  constitutional  status 
to  grassroot  institutions,  the  rural  Grama  Sabha  and 
urban  Ward  Committees  were  constituted  for  the 
involvement of people in governance processes97. Even 
though the 73rd Amendment Act gave concrete shape 
to  the  Grama  Sabha,  the  Ward  Committee  was  left  to 
the state to design for themselves98. The GCC formed 
Ward  Committees  under  the  Chennai  City  Municipal 
Corporation Act, 1919 which was amended in the year 
2010  to  allow  for  the  formation  of  Ward  Committees 
at  the  zonal  level,  rather  than  at  the  ward  level,  with 
members  consisting  of  elected  representatives—or 
ward councillors—for particular zones, and a Chairman 
who  was  elected  by  the  ward  councillors  within  each 
zone. As such, these Ward Committees do not include 
any Residential Welfare Associations (RWAs), non-profit

picked “feeling of lack of power to make a difference” 
and  “lack  of  communication  from  government”  as  the 
two primary reasons for not being more involved with 
government  (See  Figure  17).  This  highlights  the  need 
for  raising  awareness,  using  positive  and  negative 
incentives, and building trust amongst citizens so that 
they  are  more  proactive  and  responsible.  Efforts  to 
leverage different forms of public-private collaborations 
between government agencies, citizens, and corporate 
representatives are critical for optimizing efforts to build 
a city’s resilience. 

Special attention is also needed to incorporate the voice 
of the nearly 30% vulnerable citizens living in informal 
settlements across the city as it is this population that 
faces the greatest brunt of a city’s resilience challenges, 
whether relating to urbanisation, water crises, disasters, 
or the city’s governance.

FOR CHENNAI’S 
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES

CHENNAI'S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES

into 

Madras/Chennai has historically been known as a city 
of  slums.  Rather  than  a  negative  characterization,  this 
image  suggests  that  the  city  has,  since  its  early  days, 
been shaped by a strong presence and defiant inclusion 
of  low-caste  migrants 
its  urban  form.  While 
economically  weaker  sections  contribute  significantly 
to  Chennai’s  economy,  they  remain  vulnerable  to  and 
invisible  in  city  planning  and  governance.  Chennai’s 
urban 
land-use  development  and  water  resource 
management-related  limitations  affect  the  city’s  poor 
and disadvantaged the most; or instance, by failing to 
provide  affordable  housing  options  within  the  current 
city  fabric,  or  by  forcing  them  to  shoulder  a  greater 
burden  of  ecological  shocks  like  floods  by  relocating 
them to distant locations. 

Chennai housing demand, as estimated by the Second 
Master Plan for the year 2016, is around 659,479 units. 
Of  this,  Economically  Weaker  Section 
(EWS)  and 
Low-Income  Group  (LIG)  together  (at  65%  of  the  total 
demand)  account  for  428,662  units.  While  the  state 
alone  cannot  meet  this  demand,  the  government 
has  offered  50%  additional  Floor  Space  Index  (FSI)  for 
builders  constructing  low-income  housing  projects 
and  has  mandated  that  developments  on  properties 
exceeding  one  hectare  should  reserve  10  per  cent  of 
the  developed  land  for  LIG  and  EWS  dwelling  units. 
However,  these  measures  have  not  yielded  enough 
positive results. 

As such, failure to provide adequate affordable housing 
options  for  the  city’s  diverse  poor  groups  (including 
migrants,  the  physically  or  mentally  disabled,  older 
people, transgender populations, etc.) has forced them 
to live in informal settlements or slums. Nearly 20% of 
the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) notified 
slums  are  situated  along  the  low-cost  but  disaster-
prone  flood  plains  around  Chennai’s  lakes  and  river 
banks accounting for the ‘untenable’ slums—slums unfit 
for  habitation  and  hence  marked  for  relocation99  (see 
Table 3 for slum population growth).

The  range  of  vulnerabilities  faced  by  these  weaker 
sections of Chennai society goes far beyond the risk of 
floods to include insecurity of tenure, susceptibility

to  evictions,  lack  of  access  to  basic  services,  job 
insecurity, unhealthy living conditions, etc.  

Chennai’s  current  vision  of  a  slum-free  city  has 
evolved  to  predominantly  become  a  programme  of 
formalizing  informal  city  housing  through  large-scale, 
often involuntary, relocation of slum-dwellers or other 
vulnerable  residents  to  resettlement  colonies,  often 
located on ecologically fragile land in peripheral areas 
of the city. For instance, the Semmancheri resettlement 
colony on the IT Corridor houses people who were:

affected by the 2004 tsunami,
living along the banks of the Cooum river and

System (MRTS) station construction101 .

Such  resettlement  drives  have  ended  up  cutting  the 
poor  out  of  Chennai’s  urban  fabric  and  segregating 
them  into  disjointed  pockets  with  limited  access  to 
basic  facilities  such  as  water  and  sanitation,  schools, 
and  healthcare.  Ironically,  while  many  Semmancheri 
residents were relocated to the colony to reduce their 
vulnerability to floods, they were badly affected by the 
2015  floods,  since  Semmancheri  is  situated  in  a  low-
lying area.

This resettlement model has been found to undermine 
the  resilience  of  low-income  and  vulnerable  urban 
households along many axes, not just on the ecological 
one. Many of the informal settlements typically tend to 
be old and well settled, since squatting on “poromboke” 
or  un-assessed  common  lands  along  river  or  lake

RESILIENCE OPPORTUNITY

The value of 

‘Sites and Services’ (S&S) model

implemented 

S&S  projects  were 
in  Chennai  between 
1977  and  1988  by  the  Tamil  Nadu  Housing  Board  (TNHB) 
under  the  Madras  Urban  Development  Projects  (MUDP) 
I  and  II,  and  funded  by  the  World  Bank.  This  approach  to 
housing  formalisation  provided  small  plots  with  tenure 
security,  adequate  infrastructure,  and  low-interest  credit  to 
households,  allowing  them  to  invest  in  improving  their  own 
housing.  The  schemes  catered  to  a  mixed  socio-economic 
group and made significant advances in providing affordable 
shelter  to  large  numbers  of  the  urban  poor,  covering  over 
76,000 slum households over 10 years.

Today,  many  S&S  sites  in  Chennai  are  solidly  built,  vibrant 
and  dynamic  lower  middle-class  neighbourhoods  where 
residential spaces are closely enmeshed with livelihood spaces 
such as shops, saloons, and workshops and with community 
infrastructure  such  as  schools,  temples,  and  meeting  halls. 
These sites (e.g. Arumbakkam, Villivakkam, and Maduravoyal) 
have  emerged  as  some  of  the  most  successful  models  of 
housing  formalisation,  yielding  resilient  and  sustainable 
urban  neighbourhoods  which  have  offered  their  residents 
strong opportunities for social and economic mobility over a 
relatively short period of time. 

banks was a common strategy by which migrant laborers 
found shelter in Chennai from its early days. Given the long 
history of these settlements within the current urban form, 
most of them are well-established spaces, well connected 
to 
jobs,  healthcare,  and  educational  opportunities, 
where  families  have  invested  over  time  and  have  a  well-
supported  social  network.  In  many  cases,  communities 
have  successfully  negotiated  with  authorities  to  obtain 
amenities such as water supplies (street or in-house piped), 
roads, street lights, and household electricity connections. 
Uprooting these communities, particularly when they are 
resettled  in  peri-urban  locations,  disconnects  them  at 
once  from  income  sources,  education  opportunities,  and 
family healthcare, subjecting them to a sense of extreme 
disempowerment, loss, and neglect. 

Resettling  families  in  cases  where  communities  of  origin 
were not well established with access to basic amenities is 
debilitating as well, because the new homes are typically in 
distant areas, have poor access to public transportation, and 
have limited alternative job opportunities. Furthermore, the 
process of eviction is particularly harsh on those evicted. 
Families are often informed too late or misinformed about 
their relocation site. There is very minimal involvement of 
those  to  be  resettled  in  the  resettlement  and/or  eviction 
planning process.

However, TNSCB recognizes the pitfalls of this approach 
and  is  reconsidering  the  MUDP  ‘Sites  and  Services’ 
model  as  a  more  effective  and  socially  responsible 
approach to dealing with informal settlements.

While  challenges  and  needs  relating  to  low  income 
communities,  especially 
informal

represent  only  a  sub-section,  and  often  a  better-off 
section of vulnerable groups in the city. Other segments 
of  the  population,  including  those  classified  by  their 
occupation 
(migrant  workers,  manual  scavengers, 
families  involved  in  sex  work),  their  gender  (destitute 
women  and  transgender),  their  age  (elderly,  children 
and youth), their disability, or their caste are also highly 
vulnerable. This is owing not only to their condition, but 
because  less  information  is  available  about  them  and 
the  barriers  they  face  in  accessing  services  such  as 
water,  sanitation,  health  care,  education,  and  housing. 
Collectively, these urban residents may never even find 
their way into a slum or may remain invisible, yet there 
are isolated examples of efforts to address their needs.

THE FUTURE OF CHENNAI’S 
RESILIENCE CHALLENGES

In  January  2018,  the  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu 
proposed  to  expand  the  Chennai  Metropolitan  Area 
(CMA) eight-fold from the current 1189 sq. km to 8,878 
sq.  km.  This  proposal,  if  implemented,  would  make 
Chennai  the  largest  metropolitan  area  in  the  country 
after New Delhi, urbanizing 1,709 villages in the adjoining 
Kanchipuram and Tiruvallur districts102. According to the 
Chennai  Metropolitan  Development  Authority  (CMDA), 
this  proposed  expansion  was  spurred  by  anticipated 
population  growth.  This,  in  turn,  necessitates  better 
infrastructure, distribution of physical city growth, and 
land utilization in Tiruvallur and Kanchipuram districts, 
if  the  city  wants  to  attract  investment  and  experience 
balanced urban development. 

However,  the  Chennai  public  has  expressed  concern 
over  this  proposal,  particularly  in  light  of  existing 
challenges  relating  to  the  city’s  urbanization  process, 
governance,  and  environment,  and 
specifically 
water  systems  that  unfairly  affect  the  city’s  poor  and 
disadvantaged. In April 2018, three public consultative 
meetings  were  held  in  Tiruvallur,  Kanchipuram,  and 
Chennai  where  citizens  consistently  raised  concern 
about the city’s ability to cope with current challenges 
and  how  these  would  manifest  in  an  area  (potentially) 
eight  times  the  current  size.  While  the  expansion  is 
described as just a statement of intent of the government 
(CMDA  interview  2018)  that  is  yet  to  be  finalized,  it  is 
imperative  that  Chennai’s  resilience  building  efforts 
begin to acknowledge the possibility of expansion and 

prepare  accordingly.  The  city  of  Chennai  can  turn  this 
into an opportunity by:

identify heritage structures, as well as include well
planned transport corridors, housing for vulnerable
communities, disaster mitigation and management
plans, and so on; and

iv. Establishing  clarity  in  the  roles  of  institutions
such  as  the  CMDA,  TNSCB,  Housing  and  Urban
Development  Department,  Urban  Local  Bodies
(ULBs)  such  as  corporations,  municipalities,  Town
and Village Panchayats, the Revenue Department,
PWD,  Highways,  etc.,  and  well-designed  means
of  interaction  between  these  agencies  in  order  to
ensure effective inter-departmental coordination.

Implementation of this resilience strategy would be an 
essential step in this direction.

DEvELOPING THE RESILIENT CHENNAI STRATEGY

CHAPTER 05

developing the 
Resilient Chennai 
strategy 

The 100 Resilient Cities process has been used to develop the Resilient Chennai Strategy.

WHAT?
This strategy proposes pathways to ensure resilience 
of  Chennai's  people  and  infrastructure,  both  natural 
and man-made, to reduce the impact of, and respond 
and  readjust  to  current  and  future  disasters  and 
stresses.

FOR WHOM?
This  is  a  leadership  document  to  help  city  leaders 
from public, private and civic domains to collaborate 
and  guide  their  organisations  to  respond  to  the 
key  shocks,  stresses  and  challenges  of  Chennai 
over  a  5-year  horizon.  This  strategy  has  built  on  the 
experiences and knowledge of multiple stakeholders 
from  government,  non-government,  academic,  civic, 
and  private  agencies  and  has  been  designed  to  be 
aligned to existing state, metropolitan, and city policy 
and planning documents. As such, this is a resilience 
strategy of Chennai leadership, by Chennai leadership, 
for  Chennai  leadership  to  work  in  partnership  with 
citizens,  government,  and  the  private  sector  to 
translate strategy into action. 

HOW?
This strategy has prioritised: integrated understanding 
of  problems  and  solutions;  multiple  stakeholder 
involvement/co-owned  strategy;  and  a  multi-criteria 
driven  approach  to  assess  relevant  solutions  to 
resilience challenges. 

Integrated  understanding  of  problems  and  solutions: 
The  resilience  challenges  and  solutions  are  examined 
and understood in an integrated manner so the complex 
interlinkages of various shocks and stresses, natural as 
well as man-made, are taken into consideration. 

Co-owned  prioritization  of  challenges  and  solutions: 
Multiple  stakeholders  have  collectively  formulated 
resilience challenges and identified potential solutions 
ensuring that the strategy is co-owned by citizens and 
city's leaders from various sectors. 

Multi-criteria  driven  approach  to  finalize  strategy: 
Final set of proposed interventions have been selected 
based on multiple criteria, such as a) the nature of the 
intervention  (infrastructure,  policy,  capacity  building 
etc); b) alignment with current policies at local, state, and 
national  scale;  c)  stakeholder  priority  and  d)  potential 
for  cross-cutting 
implications  to  address  multiple 
resilience  challenges.  As  such,  the  actions  presented 
in  this  strategy  cover  a  wide  range  of  suggestions 
that  is  capable  of  offering  a  holistic  approach  to  build 
Chennai’s resilience.

PHASE I: Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment

2014

Selection

Chennai was selected as part of the second 
cohort of cities to join the 100 Resilient Cities 
(100RC) network. 

Agenda Setting Workshop (ASW)

Through presentations and discussions, 
the workshop supported participating 
stakeholders “to achieve a common 
understanding of the definition of resilience 
for Chennai, prioritize shocks and stresses 
that are important to the city, identify ‘drivers 
of resilience’ along 100RC’s multi-dimensional 
City Resilience Framework in which Chennai 
either excels or requires improvement, 
brainstorm key stakeholders who are critical 
for the process of building a resilience 
strategy, and envision Chennai’s future Chief 
Resilience Officer.” 

Urban Flood Summit

The summit engaged a diverse range of 
international and local experts to share best 
practices and identify high-impact solutions. 

Chief Resilience Officer (CRO)

The Greater Chennai Corporation, in 
partnership with 100 Resilient Cities, 
appointed a Chief Resilience Officer for the 
city.

PHASE II: Strategy 
Development - Deep Dive

Scope of Work

Phase II started with the preparation of a 
Scope of Work. Five out of the six Discovery 
Areas (DAs) were chosen for in-depth 
assessment, including Healthy Urbanisation, 
Water Systems, Governance Ecosystem, 
Vulnerable Communities, and Civic 
Engagement. Working Group members and 
Leads for each discovery area were identified 
and contacted to initiate Phase II work.

Citizen Survey: Namma Chennai – 
Water & Civic Engagement

The Water Survey engaged more than 600 
citizens from across the city including over 
85 citizens from informal settlements and 
different socio-economic backgrounds. 
Through electronic questionnaires and face 
to face interviews, the survey ascertained 
consumer willingness to utilize recycled waste 
water for domestic purposes and the extent 
and impact of RWH systems.

The Civic Engagement Survey conducted in 
a similar manner engaged more than 500 
citizens in the city including over 75 citizens 
from informal settlements. The survey's 
intent was to gauge civic consciousness and 
engagement with governance processes.

areas. To validate the findings of secondary 
research and gather additional insights 
interviews were conducted with multiple 
government departments, civic and academic 
experts. The citizen surveys and working 
group workshops also provided relevant 
findings for fleshing out the DA reports. 

These DA reports are the foundation of the 
Resilient Chennai Strategy.  

Working Group Meetings and 
Interviews

Working group meetings specific to the 
five DAs were conducted. Participants 
included diverse groups of technical experts, 
government officials, academicians and civil 
society representatives. These workshops 
were intended to engage in a brain-storming 
exercise to map out the relevant challenges 
related to each discovery area and discuss 
ways of addressing these challenges through 
technical, research-based, regulatory, and/or 
infrastructural interventions. The workshops 
also included a session on Opportunity 
Assessment were participants prioritized the 
interventions/actions appropriate for building 
resilience in each DA. 

In addition, several one-to-one interviews 
were conducted with experienced 
government officials, academic experts, and 
civic leaders to gain deeper understanding of 
each DA and related challenges and potential 
solutions.

Opportunity Assessment Tool (OAT)

The Opportunity Assessment Tool is a 100RC 
tool to assess and prioritise the actions and 
interventions for building resilience based 
on multiple criteria (e.g. contribution to 
CRF, ability to address various shocks and 
stresses, funding availability, timeframe 
for implementation etc). Resilient Chennai 
Strategy Actions, initially identified through 
DA work, was further assessed based on 
the OAT.  To ensure a participatory process, 
working group workshop participants were 
asked to use a concise version of the OAT to 
help shortlist the Resilient Chennai Strategy 
Actions.

Development of Chennai Resilience 
Strategy 

The development of the city resilience 
strategy started after prioritizing the 
challenges and opportunities. The strategy 
underpins Chennai’s overall vision, mission, 
goals and actions for building resilience. It 
also showcases the ongoing resilient efforts 
across Chennai while presenting concept 
notes to provide well-thought out ideas for 
future implementation.  

Peer Review

While the strategy is a reflection of opinions 
and insights of Chennai citizens, technical 
experts, civic leaders, and government 
officials, the Resilient Chennai team 
conducted a second level of engagement: 
First, by conducting one-to-one interviews 
specifically with government officials with the 
power to incorporate the strategy in policy 
and action, and secondly, by letting experts 
from different sectors peer-review the 
strategy document before formalization.

PHASE III: Implementation

Forging Ahead

Phase III of the 100RC programme aims to 
institutionalize resilience building within 
the city and implement initiatives to gain  
momentum in the city’s resilience building 
process. Resilient Chennai has forged ahead 
to facilitate/initiate a number of Resilience 
Actions in collaboration with government, 
civic, corporate, and academic partners 
during the strategy development process. 
These include:

1. Water as Leverage programme
2. Chennai Urban Horticulture programme

ACTION TYPOLOGY

HOW TO READ AN ACTION

Actions are distinguished as Flagship Actions, Supporting Actions, or Recommendations 
in this strategy document.

FLAGSHIP ACTION

Four  specific  actions  in  this  strategy  have  been  identified  as  flagship  actions  for  the 

following reasons: 

1.

2.

3.

4.

These  are  concrete  projects  that  showcase  the  city’s  strong  inclination  to  build
resilience in partnership with the Resilient Chennai Office. These actions either have
the backing from relevant government departments or have the support of multiple
civic and private partners;

These  actions  are  capable  of  addressing  several  of  the  challenges  the  city  faces
simultaneously;

Discussion and planning for these projects are already underway;

Given stakeholder interest, these projects are the priority resilience-building actions, 
Chennai Resilience Office intends to support;

SUPPORTING ACTION

These projects/programmes have been described as supporting actions because they:

1.

Are  relatively  more  tangible  in  nature  (outcome  is  in  the  form  of  policy,  strategy,
infrastructure, programme);

2. May  already  have  some  momentum  on  the  ground  that  needs  strengthening  or

upscaling, or are similar to other ongoing efforts in Chennai or elsewhere;

3.

4.

Are likely to be done in a shorter time frame;

Are relatively more feasible to implement in light of easily identifiable potential lead
agencies.

RECOMMENDATION

These are strategies/measures/programmes that:

1.

Can help Chennai better cope with shocks and stresses, but might be relatively less
tangible, and more aspirational;

2.

Are likely to be more time consuming;

3. Need greater collaboration and must be taken up by multiple agencies/sectors;

4. Might need heavy political lifting;

RESILIENCE PILLAR 1:
HEALTHY & PLANNED 
URBANIZATION

© Mahindra World City – Green township, Special Economic Zone

Development,  population  growth  and  economic 
transition  in  Chennai  have  led  to  an  unprecedented 
level  of  urban  land  use  expansion.  Chennai  was 
assigned  37th  place  in  a  2009  list  of  the  largest  urban 
areas in the world103. This growth has occurred mostly 
with  very  little  foresight  or  planning,  and,  as  a  result, 
natural and man-made shocks and stresses are much 
aggravated.  It  is  clear  that  unplanned  and  unhealthy 
urbanisation  processes,  as  characterized  by  siloed 
actions within and across public agencies, poor public 
and  private  collaboration  and  limited  levels  of  civic 
involvement, remain at the heart of Chennai’s resilience 
challenges. As such, the encroachment of, and public 
and  private  development  along  floodplains  and  water 
bodies have contributed significantly to the city’s water 
problems  while  specifically  exposing  lower-income 
communities  who  live  in  these  areas  to  high-impact 
disasters  such  as  the  2015  floods.  Thus,  Chennai’s 
water related difficulties, disasters, governance related 
limitations,  and  the  challenges  faced  specifically  by 

vulnerable  communities,  all  remain  interlinked  to  the 
issue of urbanisation.

A  recent  expression  of  intent  by  the  government  to 
expand the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) to 8,800 
sq.  km.  has  understandably  stirred  debate  among 
government and non-governmental stakeholders who 
emphasize a need to first reflect on and learn from past 
experience.  As  Chennai  expands  further,  some  of  the 
key challenges of past planning efforts, e.g., the failure 
to  integrate  environmental  and  long-term  thinking 
into  urban  planning  and  the  limited  involvement  of 
communities,  especially  those  from  weaker  sections, 
into decision-making processes must be addressed in 
order to build city resilience. Also, as Chennai aspires to 
becoming a world-class city with high quality services, 
infrastructure  and  quality  of  living,  the  city  must  also 
focus on becoming a clean, well-maintained and well-
connected, people-friendly city. 

91

MISSION 1: Urbanising responsibly

A key Chennai resilience mission is to urbanise responsibly. Future growth needs to  build city resilience to limit and respond 
to shocks and stresses such as floods, droughts, solid waste problems or encroachment. In order to do this, the city needs to 
pay urgent attention to scientific as well as socially and environmentally responsible planning. The following four goals will 
help achieve this mission:

1.

2.
3.
4.

Fostering  resilience  thinking  within  the  urban  planning  paradigm  so  that  an  integrated  approach  is  used  to  address
environmental concerns through policy and design;
Addressing solid waste related challenges more effectively;
Encouraging a more multi-stakeholder driven urban planning process;
Promoting transit-oriented development to make Chennai a well-connected, people and environment-friendly city.

GOAL 1.1  FOSTER RESILIENCE THINKING WITHIN THE URBAN PLANNING PARADIGM SO THAT AN INTEGRATED 
APPROACH IS USED TO ADDRESS ENvIRONMENTAL CONCERNS THROUGH POLICY AND DESIGN.

land  and  water  resources  and  managed 

Historically,  urban  land  and  water  resources  were  managed 
collaboratively,  with  careful  attention  paid  to  environmental 
conditions  and  limitations.  Villages  and  communities  pooled 
together 
them 
collectively as “commons” for various purposes104. However, this 
has changed drastically since colonial times, with a rising pressure 
of  population  and  economic  development  that  continues  till 
today.  Integrating  environmental  realities  into  urban  planning  in 
the current context is challenging because of multiple agencies 
with  multiple  visions  for  the  city  that  predominate  Chennai’s 
governance  scene.  These  visions,  which  translate  into  policies, 
need  to  incorporate  environmental  concerns  such  as  the  need 
to  adapt  to  climate  change  and  mitigate  risks  of  sea-level  rise, 
cyclones,  and  floods  so  that  the  city  can  be  more  resilient  and 
better able to withstand, manage and reduce its vulnerabilities.

Mainstreaming  environmental  concerns 
into  policies  and 
programmes  involves  integrating  key  elements  of  adaptation 
(e.g.,  protecting  wetlands  that  are  natural  defences  along  the 
coast or building flood embankments) in early stages of planning 
and implementation. Here, urban design can play a critical role; 
a  number  of  design  features  that  reduce  energy  and  water 
consumption  (e.g,.  solar  panels,  use  of  sustainable  building 
material,  rainwater  harvesting  (RWH))  as  well  as  programmes 
to  encourage  tree  planting  (as  a  means  to  reducing  the  urban 
heat island effect), and to improve citizen safety and well-being, 
can  help  make  the  city  more  resilient  to  long-term  shocks  and 
stresses.

Climate Change 
Adaptation strategy

Chennai  city  has  a  disaster  management  plan  that 
discusses  how  to  manage  and  respond  to  events 
such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones and tsunamis. 
As  a  disaster  management  plan,  the  scope  of  the 
document  is  restricted  to  disaster  preparedness 
and response. A more comprehensive action plan or 
strategy is required to help the city adapt to climate 
change,  which  manifests  over  a  longer  period  of 
time.  Therefore,  the  city  will  consider  developing 
a  climate  change  adaptation  strategy  which  aims 
to  make  Chennai  resilient  to  climate  threats  and 
hazards  by  reducing  exposure,  pooling  resources, 
transferring  and  sharing  risks,  increasing  capacity  to 
cope  and  by  responding  effectively  to  unforeseen 
events. This strategy will be based on the draft Tamil 
Nadu State Action Plan on Climate Change currently 
being prepared by the Government of Tamil Nadu in 
consultation  with  GIZxii.  Some  potential  elements  of 
the strategy, as informed by UNFCCC105, include:

a.

b.

c.

Identifying critical climate change risks and their
potential impact for the CMA, including sea level
rise,  storm  surges,  coastal  erosion,  heat  waves
and drought;

Setting  a  target  to  reduce  carbon  emissions
based on India’s Intended Nationally Determined
Contribution  (INDC),  as  communicated  for  the
Paris Agreement, 2016;

Employing  different  methods  of  adaptation  that
go  beyond  capital-intensive  engineering  and
technological  solutions  such  as  flood  levees
include  ecosystem-based
and  seawalls

coastal  and  wetlands  maintenance  and  restoration 
(e.g.  building  up  beaches,  using  sand  dunes  and

integrated  coastal  zone 
management,  community-based  adaptation  (CBA), 
and social protection schemes;

Protecting  city  water  bodies  and  increasing  city
vegetation.  This  would  entail  recognizing  the  critical
role CMA water bodies play in climate adaptation;

Prioritising  adaptation  efforts  where  vulnerabilities
are  highest,  such  as  in  fishing  villages,  low-income
settlements,  low-lying  areas,  areas  where  access  to
water,  sanitation,  energy,  health  care,  education  and
other services is poor;

Integrating  climate  change  risks  into  long-term  and
short-term  development  projects  and  into  urban
planning  through  innovative  measures,  including  the
redesign of metrics used to evaluate detailed project
reports  (DPRs)  of  infrastructure  projects,  retrofitting
buildings to improve water and energy efficiency and
creation of water squares, infiltration zones and green
roofs;

g. Capacity building of planners, citizens and the private
sector  so  that  they  may  understand  climate  risks,
effectively  use  available 
information  to  develop,
monitor  and  evaluate  appropriate  adaptation  actions
at the local level;

h.

Enabling better disaster preparedness and response
through improved early warning systems, contingency 
planning and integrated response.

100RC INSPIRATION: 
Rotterdam, Netherlands

Rotterdam  stands  out  as  an  inspirational  example  for  its 
comprehensive  climate  change  adaption  strategy.  While  the 
Rotterdam  Climate  Proof  (2008)  and  the  Rotterdam  Climate 
Change Adaptation Strategy (2013) highlighted the importance of 
adaptation strategies for building city’s resilience towards future 
risks, its scope is further strengthened via the Rotterdam Climate 
Initiative (RCI), which aims at reducing carbon emissions by 50% 
and making the city 100% climate proof by 2025. RCI also stands 
out as an instance of effective collaboration of multiple agencies 
(the Port of Rotterdam, the City of Rotterdam, port and industries’ 
association Deltalinqs, and the DCMR Environmental Protection 
Agency) to build city’s resilience.

Rotterdam  is  proactively  tackling  both  the  causes  and  the 
consequences of climate change and placing climate adaption at 
the  centre  of  all  city  projects  by  a)  strengthening  the  system  of 
flood, storm water surge and sea-level rise defences; b) adapting 
the urban space to combine its three functions: ‘sponge’ (water 
squares,  infiltration  zones  and  green  spaces),  protection  (dykes 
and coastal protection) and damage control (evacuation routes, 
water-resistant  buildings  and  floating  structures);  c)  increasing 
city resilience through integrated planning; and d) developing the 
opportunities that climate change brings, such as strengthening 
the economy, improving quality of life, and increasing biodiversity.

Taking  responsibility  for  resilient  planning  and  financing  the 
city has already implemented a series of effective and some new 
solutions.  These  include  extra  water  storage  facilities  in  new 
buildings,  water  squares,  green  roofs,  a  knowledge  centre  for 
building  floating  buildings,  and  flood  proofing  of  buildings  and 
their surroundings.

To  ensure  that  sensitive  land  in  the  peri-urban  areas  of 
Chennai  and  the  expanded  CMA  is  protected,  and  that 
development  there  is  environmentally  sustainable,  a 
targeted  strategy  to  protect  ecologically  vulnerable 
zones and agricultural land will be extremely crucial. This 
could be part of the CMDA’s proposed Strategic Regional 
Plan, and could essentially do the following:

g.

h.

Protect  sensitive  coastal  land  by  creating  more
awareness  about  existing  rules  and  regulations
that aim to protect the coast, including the Coastal
Regulation Zone Notification 2018;

Evaluate  current  land  reclassification  processes  to
understand their implications in terms of protecting
green and blue spaces.

The  strategy  development  process  could  potentially 
involve  extensive  collaboration  between  government 
bodies  including  the  Directorate  of  Town  and  Country 
Planning (DTCP), Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust (CRRT), 
Housing  and  Urban  Development  (HUD)  Department, 
Public  Works  Department  (PWD)  and  Environment  and 
Forests  Department,  and  non-government  agencies 
such  as  Care  Earth,  The  Nature  Conservancy  (TNC) 
and  Environmentalist  Foundation  of  India  (EFI),  with  the 
CMDA  performing  a  lead  agency  role  that  spearheads 
the process.

a.

Identify  and  map  all  ecologically  vulnerable  and
agricultural zones, including coastal lands;

b. Mark  buffer  or  no-development  zones  for  these

areas;

c.

Enable the government to buy back environmentally
sensitive  private 
through  Transferable
Development Rights (TDRs)xiii;

land

 

d. Assigning 10% open space reserve (OSR)xiv areas for
plots less than 10,000 square meters (sqm). Currently,
for the first 3000 sqm OSR is not required while for
plots  of  3000  –  10,000  sqm,  developers  need  not
reserve 10% land if they pay a compensation to the
government for the land;

e.

f.

Encourage  citizens  to  play  a  more  active  role  in
monitoring  development  by  checking  the 
land
classification  for  plots  using  the  survey  number  on
the land records websitexv;

Restrict  ribbon  developmentxvi  along  highways  by
enforcing the 2001 Tamil Nadu Highways Act;

Special measures to 
protect Ennore creek

Ennore in north Chennai is an area dotted with ecologically 
fragile  water  bodies  and  wetlands.  It  also  hosts  several 
fishing villages, industries and thermal power stations. Over 
the years, the Ennore creek has been polluted by industrial 
effluents  and  fly  ash  affecting  the  natural  ecosystem  and 
the  livelihoods  of  local  fishermen,  dependent  on  it.  Special 
measures  are  therefore  required  to  protect  the  creek  and 
the  neighbouring  communities  by  working  with  the  Forest 
Department,  local  communities  and  the  Coastal  Resource 
Centrexviii.  These  measures  would  include  recognising  the 
creek  as  an  ecologically  vulnerable  site,  and  then  creating 
a dedicated body, to restore and protect it. This body could 
be  similar  in  structure  to  the  Conservation  Authority  of 
Pallikaranai  marshland,  or  could  exist  as  a  dedicated  wing 
possibly within the CRRT.

04
Implementing a 
plantation strategy

Chennai has developed a comprehensive greening strategy 
to  increase  the  city’s  green  cover.  It  includes  detailed 
descriptions  of  appropriate  species  and  locations  in  wards 
and  zones  to  plant  these  species.  This  strategy  can  be 
strengthened further by discussing Chennai’s existing green 
cover  (as  compared  with  that  in  other  Indian  cities)  and  by 
introducing regularly updated, zone-wise green cover goals 
and community-based monitoring. For this, the green cover 
will need to be monitored every five years, and the strategy 
will have to be updated according to the new goals.

some  corrective 
measures  from  the  state  government: 
The  Commissionerate  of  Revenue  Administration,  Disaster

flood prevention and dredging work in the creek during the pre-
monsoon  period,  while  the  district  administration  has  worked 
toward  removing  ongoing  encroachments  and  blockage  of  the 
backwater. Further, the Government of Tamil Nadu has initiated 
an ecological restoration process of the creek and the Ministry of 
Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, 
has  prohibited  setting  up  of  any  new  industrial  establishments 
within  the  wetland.  While  this  is  a  start,  more  decisive  and 
concrete  protection  measures  are  needed  to  protect  and  restore 
the eco-system.

envisages  a)  planting  of  select  species  of  trees  within  the  GCC 
jurisdiction over the next five years along roads, on GCC premises 
and land, burial grounds, waterbodies, parks and vacant areas, 
and b) planting shrubs in medians to enhance green cover in the 
city.  Currently,  GCC  has  planted  23,000  saplings  in  different 
locations of Chennai city and Tamil Nadu Forest Department has 
planted  17,000  trees  in  Chennai  Metropolitan  Area.  GCC  has 
also roped in various private agencies and companies as part of 
CSR to plant 12,000 saplings. While the government continues to 
plant tree saplings across the city, the strategy notes that active 
involvement  of  local  resident  welfare  associations  (RWAs)  and 
the public in planting and maintenance is critical to the strategy’s 
success. Therefore, GCC encourages citizens, NGOs, RWAs, and 
the private sector to proactively plant trees, and is also open to 
working with them to achieve more holistic outcomes.

Hydrological mapping to 
support urban planning

This  programme  presents  an 
innovative  way  of 
embedding  ‘green  infrastructure’  into  the  city  by 
establishing rooftop vegetable gardens in government 
schools to start with. Initiated by Resilient Chennai in 
partnership  with  the  GCC,  this  programme  seeks  to 
set up rooftop gardens in government schools within 
each zone and scale it up to model localities through 
RWAs.  These  gardens  will  help  address  multiple 
goals such as:

a.

b.

c.

Providing  access  to  fresh,  nutritious,  organic
produce which can supplement the Government
of Tamil Nadu’s “nutritious meal” programme for
school children;

Keeping the environment clean and consequently 
reducing  health  hazards  through  segregating  at
source  and  using  organic  waste  as  compost  in
the gardens;

Reducing temperatures and the need to transport 
produce,  thereby  saving  fuel  and  lowering  CO2 
emissions;

d. Offering  an  opportunity  for  citizens  to  engage
positively  and  proactively  with  civic  issues,  and
allow  young  people  to  channel  their  energy
constructively;

e.

Providing a lab for innovative approaches to urban
development by showcasing good governance in 
action.

The programme has secured partial funding through 
Chennai  Smart  City  Ltd  (CSCL)’s  ‘Model  and  SMART

going  forward,  the  city  will  explore  opportunities 
to  engage  Chennai’s  well-established  academic 
institutions and civic organisations to collect and map 
this spatial data. This exercise would involve mapping 
the aerial extent of surface water bodies such as rivers, 
lakes, ponds and streams, surface and ground water 
flows, flood plains, location of groundwater wells and 
corresponding water table observed over time, rainfall 
variability,  topographic  characteristics,  hydrological

Capacity building for planners & real estate developers to 
incorporate environment-friendly solutions into urban planning

Promote environmentally sustainable and disaster resilient 
building materials in real estate development projects

Chennai’s  academic  institutions  and  urban  design 
firms with expertise in green and clean infrastructure 
and design can initiate capacity building programmes 
that  train  a)  urban  planners  in  the  CMDA  and  GCC 
and  b)  real  estate  developers,  on  how  to  include 
environment-friendly  designs  in  urban  planning  and 
design.

The programme can essentially consist of a series of 
workshops where participants are exposed to various 
available environmental designs and learn how these 
can be incorporated into their work. 

Through  the  workshops,  participants  may  also  have 
the  opportunity  to  consult  the  Counselling  and 
Consultancy Centre at CMDA (free of charge) on design 
related  elements  of  their  proposed  projects.  These 
plans may include re-designing existing parks, public 
spaces and buildings or developing new sites which 
showcase environment friendly solutions. Ultimately, 
these  plans  can  also  be  developed  into  detailed 
project  reports  (DPRs)  that  can  be  implemented  by 
interested agencies.

ACTIONS

Developing and maintaining a common database for 
all  underground  infrastructure  such  as  storm  water 
drains,  sewage  lines  and  communication  lines  can 
support more integrated planning of these city assets.

The  database  can  potentially  ensure  that  the  work

is  streamlined 
in  coordination  with  other  departments  and  that 
construction  of  new  infrastructure  doesn’t  damage

Most  of  the  required  data  will  have  to  be  collected 
from  the  appropriate  government  departments  and 
the  database  can  be  managed  by  a  consortium  of 
organizations, including the National Institute of Urban

This project would help make water the focus 
of urban design (Water Systems – Goal 2.2) 
and improve government efficiency in handling 
multiple resilience challenges such as disaster 
management or mobility and transportation by 
enabling knowledge transfer across agencies 
(Governance Ecosystem – Goal 4.1).

One  of  Chennai’s  greatest  challenges  today  relates  to  the 
management of solid waste. The amount generated per day has 
increased from 3,000 metric tons per day in 1996 to 4,067 metric 
tons per day in 2001 and 5,400 metric tons per day in 2016106,107. 
Most  waste  generated  in  the  city  is  dumped  into  two  landfills 
in  Perungudi  and  Kodangaiyur.  Part  of  the  waste  accumulates 
in  city  water  bodies  as  a  result  of  littering  and  illegal  dumping. 
This  chokes  drains  and  restricts  water  flows  during  rainfall  and 
poses  a  serious  threat  to  Chennai’s  ecology  and  the  health 
and  well-being  of  its  citizens.  To  address  Chennai’s  solid  waste 
management (SWM) issue, changes are required throughout the 
solid waste cycle, from packaging to waste generation, collection, 
transportation,  treatment,  disposal  and  recycling.  This  involves 
improving the solid waste governance system to implement the 
Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016108 by a) mandating source 
segregation; b) decentralising waste processing; and c) engaging 
with  different  sections  of  society  (contractors,  citizens,  RWAs, 
commercial  establishments,  manufacturing  companies,  bulk 
waste  generators,  empanelled  list  of  service  providers  for  bio-
degradable  waste  and  recyclers  authorised  by  GCC)  to  make 
them  understand  their  roles  and  responsibilities.  Therefore, 
collective  and  sustained  efforts  are  required  to  minimise  waste 
generation and establish scientific methods to process and treat 
waste such that it does not negatively impact the ecosystem.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Ban on “one time use and throwaway” 
plastics &  SWM Bylaws

The Government of India notified the Plastic Waste Management 
Rules, 2016, and imposed a nationwide ban on plastic carry bags 
less  than  50  micron  thickness.  Recognizing  that  this  ban  did  not 
bring  about  any  noticeable  reduction  in  the  pollution  caused  by 
plastic  carry  bags,  the  Chief  Minister  of  Tamil  Nadu  announced 
a  ban  on  “one  time  use  and  throwaway”  plastics  on  05.06.2018 
that came into effect on 01.01.2019. Fourteen single-use plastics, 
or disposable plastics such as plastic coated paper cups and plates, 
carry bags of all sizes and thickness, and straws, are banned since 
they  are  not  easily  biodegradable,  contaminate  food  and  cause 
hormone disruption, pollute water bodies and destroy marine eco-
systems, and occupy large tracts of land preventing percolation of 
rainwater into underground wells. The ban will help address illegal 
dumping of plastics into storm water drains and waterbodies. An 
active  website  to  disseminate  information  is  maintained  by  the 
GoTN: http://www.plasticpollutionfreetn.org/bannedplastic.php

Resilient Chennai has also been working with the Greater Chennai 
Corporation’s  Solid  Waste  Management  (SWM)  Department 
which is tasked with enforcing the ban in Chennai city. Resilient 
Chennai is providing policy support to the SWM department acting 
on findings of the Citizen Perception Survey conducted during the 
Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA) which highlighted solid 
waste as one of the most important challenges in the city. Resilient 
Chennai supported the SWM Department in developing the Solid 
Waste  Management  By-laws  of  the  city  that  stem  from  the  Solid 
Waste Management Rules, 2016, passed by the Government of India. 
These By-laws call for the collection of monthly SWM user fees and 
littering fees. Resilient Chennai advised the SWM Department on 
what fees to charge and aligned the revenue collection categories 
with the Revenue Department’s categories. Resilient Chennai also 
worked on the Plastic Waste Management By-laws of the city. The 
city already had a set of draft By-laws on Plastic Waste Management, 
however, this document needed to be updated and streamlined since 
a ban on single use plastics (one time use and throw away plastics 
Government Order 84) was passed by the GoTN. Resilient Chennai 
is  now  providing  support  for  the  development  of  a  Solid  Waste 
Management Policy for the city.

Redesigning solid waste 
management (SWM) contracts

TIMEFRAME
Short term

STATUS
Ongoing 
(Needs strengthening)

Chennai  was  a  pioneer  in  terms  of  involving  private 
firms  in  municipal  solid  waste  management.  Almost 
20  years  ago,  public-private-partnerships 
(PPPs) 
started  to  occupy  this  space.  However,  a  common 
drawback  among  the  various  PPP  arrangements 
was  that  the  contracts  did  not  make  the  contracted 
private firm accountable for abiding by the Municipal 
Solid Waste Rules, 2000 or the SWM Rules, 2016. The 
GCC is now addressing issues to better manage solid 
waste by making sure that the outsourced agency is 
evaluated  in  terms  of  scientific  methods  to  collect, 
transport,  treat  and  manage  solid  waste  rather  than 
weight  of  waste  disposed.  This  includes  prioritising 
source  segregation,  ensuring 
recyclables 
are  recycled,  food  waste  is  either  composted  or 
converted  to  energy  in  waste-to-energy  plants,  and

Decentralised compost units

Bio-degradable  waste  accounts  for  an  estimated 
45%  of  all  the  waste  generated  in  Chennai109.  The 
GCC  has  already  set  up  decentralised  resource 
recovery  centres  (RRCs)  in  wards.  These  are  waste 
to  energy  units  which  are  of  different  types  such  as 
bio-methanation  plants  that  produce  biogas  and 
electric  energy.  GCC  is  also  engaged  in  different 
types  of  composting  such  as  vermi-composting. 
However, many RRCs are not equipped to handle and 
process  segregated  waste  from  nearby  households 
and commercial places such as hotels, markets and 
kalyana mandapams (marriage halls). 

Therefore, using these spaces to set up decentralised 
waste units to compost food waste with the support 
of  interested  NGOs,  RWAs,  and  the  empanelled  list 
of  services  providers  authorised  by  GCC,  wherever 
possible,  would  enable  dealing  with  waste  locally 
(and thereby reducing transportation costs), reducing 
the quantity of waste being dumped into landfills and 
encouraging  other  interested  organisations/citizens 
to start similar initiatives in their own wards.

Composting waste locally will help RWAs and citizens 
witness,  first-hand,  the  conversion  of  their  waste 
into  compost,  further  sensitizing  them  to  waste 
management best-practices.

Targeted and sustained awareness 
programmes on waste management

Chennai  residents  are  generally  indifferent  to  issues 
around solid waste. This is largely the result of a lack 
of awareness about the full implications of poor waste 
management  on  the  environment  and  their  own 
health. 

It  is  also  partly  the  result  of  limited  awareness 
around how simple steps on the part of citizens can 
significantly  help  address  the  problems.  Therefore, 
a  series  of  sustained  but 
targeted  awareness 
campaigns  for  Chennai  citizens,  waste  collectors 
and  those  involved  in  treatment  can  highlight  the 
complexities of solid waste management and options 
for treatment.

All  waste  generators  generate  a  variety  of  waste, 
including  non-biodegradable  waste  that  includes 
e-waste,  bio-medical  waste,  plastic  waste,  paper
waste, cloth, metals and so on, each of which requires 
different  approaches 
to  handling  and  different
methods for processing and disposal. These may not
be widely known or understood. Thus, the proposed
awareness  programmes  would  highlight  the  flow  of
solid waste from where it is generated to where it ends
up, the impact of this journey on ground water, soil, air 
quality and citizens and various options available for
treatment and details on the plastic ban.

Children  have  been  identified  as  the  best  agents 
when  it  comes  to  introducing  behaviour  change 
among families. For instance, they have been highly 
successful in propagating safe sanitation and hygiene 
practices and are an integral part of the India’s Swachh 
Bharat programme.

The  most  effective  manner  to  target  children  is 
in  schools,  where  they  congregate.  CityWorksxx 
is  planning  to  collaborate  with  Resilient  Chennai 
to  sensitise  school  children  on  the  environmental 
impacts of poor SWM and encourage them to act as 
change agents in their families and communities.

The programme will initially be implemented in three 
GCC  schools  and  will  use  “Trashonomics”,  a  book 
developed by Solid Waste Management Roundtable 
(SWMRT),  Bangalore.  The  book 
is  application-
based, and includes activities which are simple, fun, 
practical  and  results-driven.  They  give  students  the 
opportunity to visualise outcomes and also carry their 
learning back home. 

Activities  include:  burying  different  types  of  waste 
to  identify  and  understand  which  ones  are  bio-
degradable  and  composting  vegetable  and  fruit 
peels at home to understand that composting can be 
easyxxi.

public and private spaces in environmentally sustainable manner.

Citizens  are  often  indifferent  to  solid  waste  in  part 
because  they  do  not  pay  for  it.  Introducing  positive 
and  negative  incentives  will  be  one  effective  way  to 
induce  compliance  to  proper  management  such  as 
source segregation at home, work or on the streets. 
New SWM by-laws have provisions for charging user 
fees and for fining offenders. These new by-laws will

ACTIONS

LINKS TO NATIONAL/ LOCAL POLICIES/ GOALS

National Mission on Sustainable Habitat, 2011

74th Amendment to India’s Constitution

Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919

LINKS TO INTERNATIONAL POLICIES/ GOALS

In most states and cities across India (including Tamil Nadu and 
Chennai),  collective  and  participatory  governance  has  not  been 
sufficiently  grounded  in  institutional  structures  and  processes. 
It  is  often  limited  to  aiding  select  government  decision-making 
processes and is not integrated or mainstreamed as a planning 
tool.  This  creates  mistrust  and  makes  common  citizens 
disinterested in city development programmesxxii that are in fact 
meant for them.

Therefore, going forward, Chennai’s urban plans and programmes 
will attempt to incorporate processes that are multi-stakeholder 
driven  in  order  to  create  ownership  among  non-governmental 
actors,  and  to  ensure  that  the  city  urbanises  responsibly  and  in 
an inclusive manner. This involves changing traditional processes 
by which government engages with its citizens, making structural 
changes  in  organisations  that  are  legally  enacted  to  include 
public  representation  and  involving  local  ULBs  in  decision-
making, especially with respect to metropolitan level planning in 
peri-urban areas of Chennai.

16
Strengthening public 
consultation processes

Fostering  collaboration  between  citizens,  non-profit 
organisation, 
industries  and  government  bodies 
ensures  that  multiple 
interests  and  visions  are 
protected,  and  decisions  move  beyond  economic 
visions.  More  importantly,  this  creates  a  sense  of 
ownership  among  citizens  for  city  initiatives.  Since 
public consultations are the most common means of 
engaging  multiple  stakeholders  in  public  planning, 
the  city  will  consider  ways  to  mobilise  greater 
stakeholder involvement into these processes by:

a.

Advertising  upcoming  consultations  in  multiple
English  and  Tamil  newspapers,  official  social
media spaces and on the radio at least two weeks 
prior to each event;

b. Conducting  the  consultations  in  venues  that
are  accessible  to  all,  specifically  vulnerable
communities  such  as  the  differently-abled,  low-
income communities and the elderly;

c. Conducting online citizen surveys to get feedback 
and input on various policy options. The already
existing  “Namma  Chennai”  app  could  provide
links to surveys;

d. Going 

to 

the 

relevant  communities  and
conducting  consultations  in  local  community
spaces, wherever applicable;

xxii A citizen survey conducted by the Resilient Chennai team in 2018 revealed that 
more than 50% of the total 478 respondents cited ‘lack of communication from the 
government’ and ‘feeling of lack of power to make a difference’ as the primary reasons 
for not engaging with government. https://resilientchennai.com/civic-survey

111

e.

Sharing meeting notes with participants on next
steps,  and  information  on  how  the  collected
feedback  will  be  factored  into  policymaking
and  planning  with  participants,  via  email  or
WhatsApp.

Chennai’s current governance system includes Ward 
Committees for each of its 15 zones, each comprising 
of  elected  representatives  or  councillors  of  that 
zone. This is according to the Chennai City Municipal 
Corporation  Act,  1919110.  However,  the  system  does 
not make public representation mandatory. Therefore, 
amending  the  existing  Act  to  take  a  citizen-centric 
approach  in  the  selection  of  committee  members 
would  ensure  greater  public  participation.  The  Act 
could  be  amended  to  include  representatives  from

Currently,  collective  and  coordinated  planning 
between  local  authorities  and  state  with  respect 
to 
environmental 
protection  and  infrastructure  development  in  the 
CMA  is  limited.  The  74th  Amendment  to  the  Indian 
Constitution  suggests  formation  of  a  Metropolitan 
Planning  Committee  that 
includes  elected  local 
ULB representatives. However, considering the city’s 
governance  structure,  strengthening  the  already 
existing  CMDA  which  has  been  institutionalised  for 
this purpose would be more effective.

According  to  the  Town  &  Country  Planning  Act 
1971,  CMDA’s  members  include  not  more  than  4 
representatives  from  local  authorities  functioning  in 
the CMA. However, the specific role of these members 
in the activities of the CMDA especially in planning is 
not clear. In addition, having elected representatives 
as members could better represent local authorities. 

Therefore,  the  CMDA  could  be  strengthened  by 
a) clearly  specifying  the  roles  of  members  in  its
planning  activities,  master  plan  development  and
implementation and decision making; and b) including 
a  proportionate  number  of  elected  representatives
from  local  authorities  as  members  which  would
give  local  actors  an  opportunity  to  participate  in
the  planning  process.  This  would  ensure  that  local
needs and city and state level visions for growth are
incorporated while planning the Chennai Metropolitan 
Area (CMA).

Participatory budgeting for part of Greater 
Chennai Corporation’s (GCC) budget

Participatory budgeting is a process by which citizens 
can  influence  government  budget  allocations  by 
sharing  their  views  and  demands  in  terms  of  civic 
priorities.  This  process  has  been  very  successful 
in  Porto  Alegre,  Brazil,  and  has  greatly  improved 
citizen  access  to  basic  services  there.  Introducing  a 
similar process, initially for allocating a part of GCC’s 
budget,  will  add  more  transparency  to  the  current 
budgeting  process.  It  will  also  enable  higher  citizen 
participation  in  civic  issues  and  be  a  catalyst  for 
resilience building. Some ways in which participatory 
budgeting  could  occur  include  inviting  people  to 
send in their suggestions through an online form or a 
form available in ward offices and organising multiple 
public meetings in each zone.

ACTIONS

Chennai is one of the few cities in India (apart from Mumbai and 
Kolkata) to have four major modes of public transport: buses, the 
Metro, a suburban railway and the mass-rapid transport system 
(MRTS). While city residents seem to prefer commuting by public 
transport rather than their own vehicles111, it still has the highest 
vehicle density (2,093 vehicles per km of road) in the countryxxiii112, 
making  it  increasingly  difficult  to  access  places,  activities  and 
services in a timely fashion. These numbers also suggest that the 
city’s  road  infrastructure  is  inadequate.  Yet,  expanding  the  road 
network will incentivise higher vehicular movement and increase 
air and noise pollution levels with severe long-term implications 
on  health  and  climate.  Therefore,  it  is  crucial  that  the  city  and 
its  peri-urban  areas  grow  in  a  manner  that  simultaneously 
increases  a)  public  transportation  system  connectivity  to  and 
within peri-urban areas; and b) mobility for all its citizens through 
non-motorised  forms  of  transportation  such  as  walking,  cycling 
and  cycling  rickshaws  which  offer  multiple  benefits,  including 
public  health,  improved  quality  of  life,  reduced  environmental 
impact  and  reduced  carbon  emissions.  This  calls  for  paying 
special  attention  to  the  way  transport  systems  and  associated 
infrastructure  are  designed,  such  that  they  are  accessible  to  all 
(e.g.  elderly,  disabled,  women,  etc.),  affordable  for  all,  and  have 
limited impact on local natural resources and the environment at 
present and in the future.

infrastructure  for  charging  and  expanding  the
bicycle sharing programme (currently in Anna Nagar, 
Shenoy Nagar and Marina Beach) to other areas;

e.

f.

Increasing  the  frequency  of  buses/trains  and
introducing  new  routes  to  peri-urban  areas  to
improve connectivity;

Planning  arterial  roads  for  newly  developing  or
planned areas prior to laying them, including plans
for  underground  infrastructure,  with  the  goal  of
improving  access  to  basic  services  and  last  mile
connectivity.

The  Chennai  Unified  Metropolitan  Transport  Authority 
(CUMTA)  recently  notified  by  the  State  Government114, 
may oversee the preparation of this plan. 

To ensure that the city’s transportation system improves 
connectivity  within  and  to  peri-urban  areas,  and  is 
affordable and accessible to all sectors of society while 
also reducing the city’s carbon footprint, a comprehensive 
sustainable urban mobility plan is required. This plan will 
aim  to  integrate  land-use  planning  and  transportation 
to  address  the  mobility  needs  of  all  citizens  and 
infrastructure requirements of all modes of transport. It 
will also enable integration of existing modes of transport 
to ensure that commuters can move easily from one to 
the other. Elements of such a plan would include:

a.

b.

c.

Introducing  specific  time-bound  targets  to  be
achieved, such as increasing use of public transport
during peak hours or introducing a specific number
of eco-modes of transport (e.g. electric buses, autos);

Integrating  pedestrian 
facilities,  non-motorised
and  public  transport  systems  to  ensure  last-mile
connectivity  and  connectivity  between  public
transport  systems  by  introducing  road  and  street
design standards;

Improving  safety  and  security  on  public  transport
systems. This could be achieved by installing CCTVs
in  all  stations  and  ensuring  they  are  not  tampered
with  during 
installation,  ensuring  that  stations
and  bus  stops  are  well-lit  as  per  Bureau  of  Indian
Standards normsxxiv, 113, setting up/moving bus stops
and  stations  out  of  isolated  locations  to  areas  that

xxiv According to World Resource Institute, “The average level of illumination 
on road surface in case of important roads should be 30 lux, for other main 
roads carrying mixed traffic the value should be 15 lux and for local roads 
and secondary roads carrying light traffic the value should be 8 lux and 4 lux 
respectively.”

100RC INSPIRATION: 
Singapore City, Singapore

Singapore  is  considered  a  top  ranked  sustainable  city  in  Asia. 
The city’s Land Transport Master Plans (2008 and 2013) have a 
significant role to play in making Singapore liveable, inclusive, 
more connected, and sustainable.

The  second  LTMP  (2013)  long  term  plan,  in  particular,  aims 
at  making  public  transport  the  primary  public  choice  of 
transportation. The LTMP 2013 set out specific targets to achieve 
before 2030. For instance, 8 out of 10 households will be living 
within  10  minutes'  walk  from  a  train  station;  85%  of  public 
transport  journeys  under  20  km  will  be  completed  within  60 
minutes; and 75% of all peak hour journeys will be made using 
public transport. The LTA's land transport master plan 2013 also 
targets the expansion of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network 
to  360  km  by  2030,  improve  walkability,  bicycling  facility,  and 
reduce  the  reliance  on  private  transport  by  improving  the  road 
system and network, closely monitoring vehicle population growth 
rate, fine-tuning road usage charges, and improving road safety.

Singapore’s  efforts  especially  highlight 
importance  of 
participatory planning to understand and incorporate commuters’ 
opinions,  feedback,  and  concerns  before  drafting  the  plan  and 
policies.  Key  learnings  from  Singapore’s  transportation  related 
actions include the need for a regional/integrated, long term, and 
participatory mobility plan that sets specific targets.

Scale up existing efforts to redesign 
roads to improve mobility for all

Several  city  roads  are  currently  being  upgraded  to  include 
bicycle lanes, wider pavements and innovative sign boards that 
encourage  people  to  cycle.  The  city  will  work  towards  scaling 
up  these  efforts  through  the  Chennai  Smart  City  Ltd  (CSCL), 
introduce smart signalling that detects traffic flow and controls 
lights,  and  earmark  spaces  for  street  vendors,  bicycles  and 
parking.  The  effort  can  simultaneously  make  Chennai’s  roads

introduced auto/cab feeder services that connect several Metro 
stations  including  Koyambedu,  Ekkaduthangal,  Guindy,  Ashok 
Nagar, Thirumangalam and Little Mount to MRTS stations with 
important places of work, education, medicine and leisure (see 
Figure  18).  In  addition,  CMRL  has  introduced  bicycle  sharing 
systems from most stations on its “green line” (St. Thomas Mount 
to Chennai Central), which passengers can hire free of charge to 
commute locally. Similar efforts will help promote use of public 
transportation more widely across the city.

became the first city in India to adopt the Non-Motorised Transport 
(NMT) Policy. The policy, reviewed by the ITDP India Programme, 
sets aside 60% of the Chennai Corporation’s transport budget for 
the creation and maintenance of walking and cycling networks in 
the city. So far, Chennai has accomplished over 75 km of Complete 
Streets and is re-designing an additional 60 km of street network.

RESILIENCE PILLAR 2:
WATER SYSTEMS

MISSION 2: Carving a resilient future around our water resources

In light of the above discussion, one of Chennai’s missions is to carve a resilient future around the city’s water resources. This 
entails more than bouncing back from water related disruptions; it involves building linkages and initiating integrated efforts 
on a continual basis, so that solutions to Chennai’s water problems are holistic and sustainable in the long run. Three specific 
goals will help achieve this mission:

Fostering responsible water usage.

1.
2. Giving primacy to water related challenges in urban design efforts.
3.

Ensuring better coordinated efforts between public, private and civic agencies to restore and protect our water bodies
(including the surviving erys).

© Resilient Chennai - Adyar Poonga

As a coastal city with around 3600 water bodies, three 
river  systems  and  arguably  adequate  rainfall,  Chennai 
has the potential to be the ‘water capital’ of Asia—i.e. an 
exemplary city in this part of the world that showcases 
innovative  and  carefully  considered  water  resource 
management.  Historically,  water 
in  Chennai  and 
Tamil Nadu was managed by a traditional ery system, 
which  ensured  that  the  adequate  but  seasonal  water 
supply  from  the  northeast  monsoons  was  available 
to  all  throughout  the  year,  including  during  drought 
years, while also mitigating flood risk. As such, the ery 
system is, to this day, recognized as an engineering and 
management marvel, with many lessons to learn from. 
Nonetheless, unplanned development and poor water 
management in Chennai over the years have rendered 
the  ery  system  dysfunctional,  while  also  leading  to 
the  current  state  of  affairs  wherein  the  city  struggles 
at  any  given  time  with  either  too  little  water  (in  the 
form  of  droughts)  or  too  much  (in  the  form  of  floods), 
with  detrimental  effects  on  people,  infrastructure  and 
livelihoods.  Further,  Chennai’s  water  system  is  at  risk 
from climate change, which is likely to manifest through 
extreme  precipitation  events—resulting 
in  more 
droughts  and  floods—sea  level  rise  and  increasing 

temperatures which in and of itself is likely to exacerbate 
existing water system challenges. 

Chennai’s  water  woes  have  been  further  shaped  by 
institutional  and  data  fragmentation,  siloed  thinking 
and action, lack of human and financial resources and a 
failure to recognize that water systems traverse natural 
and  socio-technical  environments,  therefore  requiring 
a holistic approach for efficient management. 

Post  the  2015  floods,  city  authorities  and  citizens 
have  become  increasingly  sensitive  to  the  complexity 
of  water  systems.  There  is  growing  recognition  of 
how  water  related  challenges  such  as  availability, 
affordability,  pollution,  flood  mitigation,  and  ground 
water  recharge  are  interconnected.  Simultaneously, 
the  city 
is  beginning  to  recognize  that  droughts, 
temperature  rise  and  sea  level  rise  are  longer  term 
events that manifest over many years. Therefore, these 
events  require  longer  term  adaptation  measures  that 
integrate efforts to protect, restore and conserve water 
resources with efficient urban land-use planning, solid 
waste  and  wastewater  management,  and  stringent 
monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. 

123

GOAL 2.1  FOSTER RESPONSIBLE WATER USAGE.

An  emphasis  on  effective  demand  management,  responsible 
water  usage  and  responsible  water  sourcing  have  emerged 
as  a  critical  means  of  enhancing  water  security  in  Chennai  city. 
Achieving  this,  would  entail  a)  ensuring  that  the  value  of  water 
is  recognised  by  society  through  effective  pricing;  b)  ensuring 
water  conservation  through  the  installation  of  water  meters; 
c) urging  domestic,  commercial  and  industrial  users  to  reduce
dependency on fresh water by switching to alternative sources of
water including recycled waste water, storm water and harvested
rain  water  for  non-drinking  purposes,  and;  d)  ensuring  that  the
cost  and  price  of  these  alternatives  are  lower  than  fresh  water
sources, specifically that from private bore wells.

Chennai was the first city in India to make rain water harvesting 
(RWH) compulsoryxxvi. This was done in 2003, in response to a severe 
drought that led to a complete shutdown of the city’s piped water 
system. It was also one of the first cities in the country to provide 
recycled  water  to  industries  and  is  currently  increasing  sewage 
treatment plant capacity. Further, water sector stakeholders and 
residents themselves have indicated that the way forward should 
primarily involve demand management rather than conventional 
supply-side  solutions.  While,  the  Chennai  Metropolitan  Water 
Supply and Sewage Board (CMWSSB)’s master plan emphasises 
source augmentation through desalination plants, CMWSSB also 
encourages users to tap into alternate, more sustainable sources 
of  water  like  recycled  waste  water.  It  is  also  simultaneously 
beginning to explore demand-side solutions that reduce overall 
water  consumption  and  system  losses.  It  is  important  that  this 
momentum to source water responsibly and better manage water 
demand through conservation measures is further leveraged.

Rise to recycle water—creating 
awareness around water recycling

26
Water recycling directive for 
domestic and industrial use

This project will involve two components. The first will 
be the launch of a widespread and sustained campaign 
(through multiple media streams) to raise awareness 
about  the  benefits  of  waste  water  management 
and  to  stimulate  behavioural  change  and  public 
acceptance among residents around recycled water. 
The  campaign  objective  is  to  ensure  that  residents 
begin  to  accept  and  use  treated  waste  water  for 
domestic  purposes 
(e.g.  gardening,  sanitation, 
cleaning, washing etc.) and eventually for drinking and 
cooking.  The  campaign  will  be  conducted  in  Tamil 
and  English  and  will  include  information  about  the 
benefits of recycling, the reliability of tertiary treated 
water  for  drinking  purposes,  methods  to  recycle 
water  and  costs  associated  with  different  treatment 
techniques.  A  similar  campaign  will  be  conducted 
in both public and private educational institutions to 
ensure  maximum  reach.  The  second  component  of 
the project will be creation of a data repository on best 
practices in water recycling that includes information 
about  what  works,  what  doesn’t  work,  why,  and  the 
costs  associated  with  recycling  at  different  scales. 
This  internet-based  archive  will  bring  together  case 
studies  from  across  sectors,  including  government, 
the private sector and industry, and will be constantly 
updated to reflect the latest field learning. Its aim will 
be to address a current knowledge gap and to provide 
information  to  industry,  institutions  and  interested 
residents  on  alternative  and  affordable  practices 
accessible to all.

Mandating  water  recycling  provides  the  necessary 
policy  impetus  required  to  increase  adoption  of 
water recycling. CMWSSB already issued an advisory 
in  April  2017,  stating  that  new  water  and  sewage 
connections  will  be  refused  for  ‘special  and  multi-
storied  buildings’  that  do  not  recycle  or  use  waste 
water. Accordingly, new water and sewage connection 
applicants have to include a self-declaration that they 
will  comply  with  this  rule  by  separating  grey  water 
from black water (e.g. by dual plumbing). Expanding 
the scope of this mandate to include commercial and 
industrial establishments, and giving it the necessary 
legal  backing  so  that  non-compliance  is  punishable 
by law, would be a step forward, as would publicising 
and  communicating  the  provisions  of  the  existing 
mandate to RWAs and industries.

Decentralised water treatment 
systems (DEWATS)

Investing  in  decentralised  waste  water  treatment 
systems at household and neighbourhood scales for 
localised waste water treatment and reuse can greatly 
reduce demand for fresh water. DEWATS technology 
serves individual or small groups of properties, require 
less up-front investment and land than large systems, 
and  are  more  effective  at  coping  with  the  need  to 
scale up (or down) services to correspond to needs115. 
These are in contrast to traditional centralised systems 
that  require  greater  financial  investment  on  multiple 
fronts—land,  technology,  capacity,  maintenance—
that make them difficult to implement.

first step. In addition, DEWATS could also be used to 
check sewage inflow into water bodies, by directing 
the  sewage  into  these  in-situ  treatment  systems.  In 
Chennai, decentralised systems such as ‘BioGill’ and 
‘Solar  Active  Island  Reactor’  are  already  being  used 
for this purpose.

Investment (through individuals, housing 
complexes, commercial and industrial actors) in  
DEWATS can make citizens more responsible in 
the way they manage water and would incentivise 
water conservation (Governance Ecosystem 
– Goal 4.3). It would also generally equip the
city to manage its waste more efficiently in an
environment-friendly manner, keeping its water
bodies clean. (Healthy Urbanisation – Pillar 1).

CHENNAI ASPIRATION: 
BioGill Waste Water Treatment System

BioGill  is  an  Australian  decentralised  waste  water  treatment 
company  that  uses  modular,  and  natural  systems,  ideally  suited 
to treat waste water at the point where it enters water bodies. The 
Adyar River, for instance, has over 64 outlets bringing raw sewage 
into the river. This system allows us to treat the waste water at the 
point it enters the river and releases the treated water into the river, 
the  added  benefit  being  that  the  treated  water  contains  microbes 
that will continue to treat the water in the river. BioGill has a local 
partner, Aspick Engineering, in Chennai. They have offered to show 
proof of concept using one of their systems on Sembakkam Lake, 
which is being restored by The Nature Conservancy. 

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Solar Active Island Reactor

The  Solar  Active  Island  Reactor  project  aims  to  break  the  cycle 
of  contamination  and  begin  a  process  of  waterway  restoration 
by  demonstrating  a  floating,  decentralised,  nature-based  water 
treatment  system  on  the  Adyar  river.  Facilitated  by  Resilient 
Chennai  and  led  by  Pitchandikulam  Forest  Consultants,  the 
reactor or ‘live boat’ has been set up on the Adyar River, next to 
Madras Boat Club and has a treatment capacity of 30,000 litres. 
The live boat is designed like an island and has four components 
– bioremediation,  floating  horticulture,  solar  water  treatment,
communal water stewardship and education. The island contains
natural wetland plants that support aerobic treatment and a solar
PV  powered  aeration  system  that  drives  active  aeration  and  the
water  treatment  process.  Initial  water  quality  tests  (conducted  in
March  2019)  reveal  an  89%  reduction  in  total  suspended  solids
and 71% in chemical oxygen demand in the area, compared to pre-
installation. The pilot project has been donated to Chennai Rivers
Restoration  Trust  by  Biomatrix/Conscious  Ground,  working  in
collaboration with Pitchandikulam Forest Consultants.

Install water meters to monitor 
water consumption

Chennai, like many other Indian cities, does not measure 
water  use  at  the  customer  end,  and  therefore  does 
not price water based on consumption. CMWSSB has 
made several attempts to introduce water meters for 
but they have been unsuccessful, primarily because 
of  a  combination  of  technical,  logistical  and  pricing 
issues. However, a survey carried out by the Resilient 
Chennai team reveals that 72% of participating citizens 
are willing to support government metering policyxxvii. 
The Chennai Smart City Ltd programme will introduce 
domestic  water  metering  for  households  in  T-Nagar 
as  part  of  an  ‘area  based  plan.’  It  will  also  introduce 
‘AMR  (automatic  meter  reading)  meters  for  high 
volume consumers such as institutions and marriage 
halls in the cityxxviii. The city will consider building on 
this programme by introducing it to other city wards 
and  zones  to  measure  water  consumption,  and 
consequently frame an effective water pricing policy 
that  strikes  the  right  balance  between  affordability, 
cost recovery, economic efficiency and conservation.

100RC INSPIRATION: 
Cape Town, South Africa

Through an amendment in their Water By-Law 2018, Cape Town 
introduced  water  management  devices  (WMDs)  that  replace 
standard water meters for users. These WMDs are programmed to 
provide a daily allocation of water for customers, by switching on 
at a fixed time every morning (e.g. 4 am) and generally restricting 
water  supply  to  350  litres  per  day  and  10.5  KL  per  month.  The 
device  switches  off  when  the  household  has  used  its  daily  water 
quota  and  resets  the  next  morning  to  release  the  daily  amount. 
Any amount not used is carried over to the next day during that 
calendar month. The key function of the WMD is that, customers 
will not be able to use more water than their daily limit in one day 
and if they use up all their water, they would have to wait until the 
next day to receive more. A WMD can therefore, help manage water 
consumption and provides customers with a daily allocation of free 
water (or a greater quantity by agreement), and helps customers 
limit or completely avoid water and sanitation charges. Further, for 
low income households, Cape Town city government will provide, an 
additional allocation of 4.5 KL per month free of charge, install the 
WMD without any charge, write off all water and sewage arrears 
(once-off), and fix and replace faulty plumbing (once-off repairs).

High  NRW  has  consequences,  notably  in  terms  of 
water  quality  and  energy  costs,  because  a  high 
percentage of leaks indicate higher chances of water 
contamination,  and  higher  treatment  and  energy 
costs  to  maintain  water  pressure  and  quality.  It  also 
has consequences for water availability in the system, 
and  the  quantity  of  water  that  ultimately  reaches 
users.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  that  electromagnetic 
flow  meters  are  installed  at  Chennai’s  reservoirs, 
treatment plants, desalination plants, zonal and ward 
level  pumping  stations  and  the  piped  network  to 
measure  flow,  detect  leakage  and  maximise  water

ACTIONS

Chennai  is  prone  to  floods  and  more  so  to  droughts.  Over  the 
past two decades, these have become increasingly frequent and 
intense, partly indicating climate change, and partly due to rampant 
urban  development  with  limited  attention  to  the  environment 
and  the  resources/services  it  offers.  Planning  and  designing 
urban land use and infrastructure can be a key tool to mitigating 
risks associated with Chennai’s water related challenges. Taking 
a  long  term  and  systemic  approach  to  considering  issues  of 
climate  change,  potential  sea  level  rise,  impending  floods  and 
droughts  when  planning  new  developments  or  designing  new 
infrastructure can strengthen Chennai’s capacity to reduce risks 
and  build  city  resilience.  Giving  primacy  to  water  in  planning 
and  design  therefore  requires  mainstreaming  risk  mitigation 
within  current  infrastructure  development  efforts  (e.g.  building 
bioswales to help ground water recharge).

Pilot project showcasing 
water-sensitive design

Inspired  by  the  Adyar  Poonga,  the  city  can  invest  in 
a  pilot  project  (or  projects)  to  showcase  how  water-
sensitive  urban  design  can  address  multiple  water 
related  goals  such  as  conservation,  quality,  flood 
management and beautification simultaneously. 

As  part  of  the  Water  as  Leverage  Project  (WaL),  a 
consortium  of  local  and  international  partners  has 
proposed  to  redesign  the  Mambalam  Canal  with  a 
similar  goal.  The  Mambalam  area  is  situated  to  the 
west of the old city centre, between the Cooum and 
Adyar  Rivers,  and  is  synonymous  with  flooding  and 
poor  drainage.  Historically,  this  area  was  the  former 
“Long Tank”, a large reservoir that served as the city 
boundary  until  1921.  Currently,  the  Mambalam  basin 
with  a  residential  population  of  around  380,000, 
has  the  largest  shopping  district  in  India  (T.  Nagar), 
generating INR 200 billion—USD 2.7 billion—per year. 
The proposal aims to transform the Mambalam canal 
and through it the larger Mambalam basin, to become 
more  resilient  to  floods,  drought  and  pollution, 
and  become  a  flourishing  public  space  at  the  city 
centre. The proposal includes the following essential 
elements:

WATER AS LEVERAGE FOR 
RESILIENT CITIES: ASIA

the 

Chennai is one of three target cities for the ‘Water 
as Leverage for Resilient Cities Asia’ project which 
was  launched  at  the  UN  Climate  Conference 
COP23 in Bonn, Germany, on November 9, 2017. 
It is spearheaded by the Dutch Special Envoy for 
Water Affairs Henk Ovink, the Asian Infrastructure 
Investment  Bank, 
the  Global  Center  on 
Adaptation,  100  Resilient  Cities,  Architecture 
International 
Workroom  Brussels  and 
Architecture  Biennale  Rotterdam. 
Its  overall 
purpose is to foster collaboration across public, 
private and civic agencies to identify sustainable 
solutions for water related challenges that can be 
scaled up and that can act as leverage points for 
addressing the multitude of resilience challenges 
faced by these three cities. In Chennai, the WaL 
project aims to tackle the city’s water challenges 
in  an 
inclusive  way.  Two 
international, multi-disciplinary teams with local 
expertise–Rise Chennai and City of 1,000 Tanks

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: Tholkappia 
Poonga  (Adyar Poonga) 

In  its  effort  to  restore  the Adyar  River,  Chennai 
Rivers  Restoration  Trust  (CRRT)  completed 
the eco-restoration of 58 acres of the Adyar 
Creek  in  Phase  I  of  the  Adyar  Eco  Park 
project.  The  Adyar  Creek  and  estuary 
cover  an  area  of  about  358  acres.  A 
survey of historic plans showed that the 
area functioned as a storm water outflow 
for the watershed around the Creek and a 
reservoir for tidal water during high tide. 
CRRT aimed to restore the degraded creek, 
rehabilitate  its  coastal  ecology,  and  introduce 
an environmental educational component with Adyar 
Poonga as a research base. The restoration effort included excavating 
and  desilting  to  increase  the  water  spread  area  by  59%,  arresting 
sewage discharge into the creek by diverting it into sewer pipelines 
and recreating natural bio-diversity by planting around 172 species of 
plants such as mangroves, mangrove associates, reeds, terrestrial and 
aquatic plants. The project has resulted in an increase in the number 
of  amphibians,  reptiles,  birds  and  mammals  in  the  Poonga.  The 
Poonga also includes an interactive learning space, an environmental 
education programme to create awareness about ecology and coastal 
ecology among school children.

Phase II of the project (spanning 300 acres), aims to restore the creek’s 
ecological functions of acting as a water retention site and a natural 
buffer against tidal waves and storm surges. 

100RC INSPIRATION:
Mexico City, Mexico

Mexico City has a similar history of developing by encroaching and building 
upon  its  natural  waterbodies  like  Chennai.  Hence,  as  part  of  their 
resilience  strategy,  the  city  aims  to  improve  its  flood-prevention 
capacity  using  innovative  water-sensitive  green  and  blue  urban 
design  solutions  that  are  capable  of  capturing  rainwater  and 
either retaining it for later use or infiltrating it into the ground. 

In  2015,  the  city  in  collaboration  with  the  100RC  Platform 
Partner Deltares initiated a project to build water plazas in the 
city’s unique zone of Xochimilco, a residential and agricultural 
area  threaded  with  islands  and  canals.  Under  normal  weather 
conditions, the planned water plazas are meant to operate like any 
other public square, where people meet, spend time, and attend special 
events. During rainstorms, water from surrounding streets is directed into 
the  squares,  which  have  been  specially  engineered  for  pooling  and  draining.  The  French 
Development Bank is already funding Phase I of Deltares’ plan for Xochimilco, while 100RC’s 
partner  Rebuild  by  Design  (RBD)  is  leading  a  community  engagement  process  to  ensure 
that the water plazas not only provide catchment areas to control flooding, but also promote 
social cohesion and offer appealing public spaces. These solutions need to be appreciated and 
replicated for their ability to address multiple goals.

CHENNAI ASPIRATION: 
Muttukadu Backwaters

Among  the  many  components  of 
the  RISE  Chennai 
team’s  work 
as  part  of  the  ‘Water  as  Leverage 
Project’  (WaL),  one  sub-component 
is  to  strengthen  the  role  of  Muttukadu 
backwaters and Buckingham Canal to act 
as a natural buffers against sea level rise and 
coastal flooding, while also addressing issues of encroachments, 
water quality and local livelihoods. It will do so by developing an 
adaptive coastal defence plan that follows a more moderate and 
gradual approach to sea level rise, aiming at the short term, with 
a focus on increasing safety levels when required, in the long term. 
Some elements of the plan include: introducing sand nourishment 
along the beach to strengthen the eroded coastline along Muttukadu 
village; dredging the river mouth and transporting the sediments 
further north, where it can prevent future siltation; installing flap 
gates along Buckingham Canal (feeds into Muttukadu) to prevent 
entry of backwater into the storm water drain system, west of the 
canal; developing habitat islands within an existing lagoon that 
can help restore the biodiversity while also acting as a natural 
mechanism  to  reduce  impact  of  rising  sea  levels;  integrating 
eco-tourism activities with protection of biodiversity; redirecting 
inflows  of  waste  water  and  restoring  the  Muttukadu  wetland 
through removal of contaminated sediments and deepening of the 
lagoon.

simultaneously.  Through  the  ongoing 
Integrated 
Storm  Water  Drain  Project,  the  Greater  Chennai 
Corporation (GCC) is already attempting to construct 
recharge  wells  and  connect  SWD  to  temple  tanks 
wherever possible to allow for ground water recharge. 
This effort needs to scale up by mapping out ground 
water aquifers to understand local hydrology—where 
recharge  can  have  maximum  impact  on  storage 
and  water  quality—and  replicating  natural  drainage 
processes  on  site  to  manage  rainfall  close  to  where 
it falls. The essential elements of this network are: to 
ensure a significant amount of ground water recharge; 
to control the quantity of runoff such that the system 
can deal with everyday flooding and specific rainfall 
events;  to  manage  the  quality  of  runoff  to  prevent 
pollution;  and  to  create  better  spaces  for  people 
(especially pedestrians) above the ground.

100RC INSPIRATION: 
Berkeley, United States

To  reduce  risk  of  flooding  and  make  its  storm  water  drain 
infrastructure more resilient Berkeley used an innovative financing 
mechanism worth learning from. 86.5% of Berkeley voters approved 
USD 100 million general obligation infrastructure bond in 2016. 
The bond known as Measure T1 was primarily meant to fund repair 
work, renovation or replacement of the city’s aging infrastructure, 
including  storm  water  drains.  Berkley  stands  out  also  for  taking 
a  comprehensive  approach  to  storm  water  management.  Instead 
of  focusing  on  conventional  storm  water  infrastructure  alone, 
Berkeley  uses  multi-purpose  green  infrastructure  (GI)  (e.g.  rain 
gardens,  permeable  pavements,  and  cisterns)  that  offer  multiple 
benefits  relating  to  flood  mitigation,  water  conservation,  removal 
of pollutants, climate adaptation, beautification of neighbourhoods 
etc.

CHENNAI ASPIRATION: 
Kosasthalaiyar Integrated 
Storm Water Drains Project

For phase III of the Integrated Storm Water Drains project, GCC 
is  proposing  to  construct  over  763  km  of  storm  water  drains  in 
Manali, Madhavaram, Thiruvottiyur, parts of Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar, 
Ambattur and Anna Nagar zones. The project design would include, 
allowing  for  rain  water  harvesting  by  integrating  local  tanks  as 
retention reservoirs and construction recharge pits; identification 
of, and restricting sewage discharge into storm water drains; and 
restoration of 55 water bodies. With an approximate project cost 
of INR 25.18 billion, the overall aim is to improve living standards 
and enhance fresh water availability in the basin. As of May 2019, 
a detailed project report has already been prepared by GCC and an 
external consultant.

ACTIONS

The 2015 floods and resulting devastation brought home the importance 
of conserving regional water bodies and water ways. As a result, several 
efforts are underway by actors such as GCC, PWD, CSCL, CRRT, EFI and 
TNC.  At  present,  GCC  has  identified  210  water  bodies  and  is  working 
towards  restoring  them.  Some  of  these  efforts  are  being  undertaken 
in  partnership  with  non-governmental  organisations  and  through  CSR 
support.  Other  examples  include  the  Integrated  Cooum  River  Eco-
Restoration Project, Chetpet Ery restoration and lake restoration projects 
by  CSCL.  These  projects  have  the  overall  objective  of  restoring  and 
rejuvenating water bodies including lakes, rivers, ponds and tanks/erys 
to mitigate the impact of extreme events (such as floods and drought). 
This  goal  intends  to  influence  existing  projects  so  they  achieve  their 
full potential through coordinated actions from the various government 
departments  and  non-governmental  organisations  involved,  including 
the GCC, PWD, CRRT, CSCL and EFI. This entails:
a.

coordination/communication (and data sharing) across government 
departments  and  agencies  so  that  individual  actions  support
and  complement  the  other  departments  work  rather  than  being
counter-productive or repetitive;
coordination/communication,  not 
just  across  government
departments  that  own  and  manage  water  bodies  but  also  across
other  associated  departments  such  as  TNSCB  (for  low  income
housing),  GCC  (for  solid  waste  management)  and  TNPCB  (for
water  quality)  beyond  specific  project  periods  so  complex  issues
of encroaching on or polluting water bodies can be tackled in an
integrated manner; and
communication across government and non-governmental actors
for  collective  learning  and  common  understanding  of  effective
restoration procedures to ensure that ongoing efforts collectively
have a higher impact.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Sembakkam lake restoration

is  an 

together 

The Semmbakkam lake restoration 
project  is  an  example  of  several 
actors  working 
to 
restore  and  rejuvenate  a  water 
body  in  Chennai.  The  restoration 
project  is  being  led  by  The  Nature 
Conservancy  (TNC)  which 
international NGO that works to conserve 
water  bodies,  lands  and  forests  and  a  platform  partner 
for 100 Resilient Cities. The lake has degraded over time 
due  to  siltation,  untreated  sewage  disposal,  solid  waste 
dumping and illegal encroachments, significantly reducing 
its ability to act as a flood sink. TNC is working actively to 
involve the local community in restoration efforts and with 
other  stakeholders  across  the  city  government,  research 
institutions  and  private  companies  to  effectively  address 
issues of water pollution from solid waste dumping to waste 
water discharge.

This effort prioritizes nature-based solutions for restoration, 
which  provide  multiple  ecosystem  benefits.  Strategies  for 
restoration are aimed at improving water storage capacity, 
reviving inlet and outlet channels to facilitate water flow 
into other lakes that are part of the same cascading system, 
improving water quality and habitat for biodiversity, while 
also creating a recreational space integrating people and 
nature. The project began in March 2018 and will likely be 
completed by December 2019.

Under the leadership of organisations that are active 
in the lake restoration space such as EFI and CRRT, a 
consortium of government, citizen, corporate and non-
profit  representatives  can  be  created  to  advise  lake 
restoration  efforts,  monitor  regulatory  compliance 
and  to  forge  collaboration  across  various  parties  so 
that  different  agencies  work  efficiently  and  not  at

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust

The  42km  long  Adyar  River,  flows  into  the  Southern  parts  of 
Chennai  city,  originating  from  Adanur  tank  near  Guduvancherri 
and  carrying  the  surplus  flow  from  Chembarambakkam  Lake. 
Untreated waste water discharged into the river from drains within 
CMA, industrial effluents from Pammal region, open defecation, and 
illegal solid waste dumping on the river banks and encroachments 
in the city, are some of the causes the river is degraded and polluted. 
As a result, Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust has undertaken the 
eco-restoration projects with the aim of establishing a healthy river 
ecosystem to reverse the above mentioned damages caused to the 
river121.  Some  of  these  measures  are  implemented  in  the  Adyar/
Tholkappia Poonga Restoration project. 

The Cooum River runs through a distance of 20 km within Chennai 
city, and originates from the surplus course of Cooum Tank.  Prior 
to entering city limits, the upper-catchment of the river serves the 
purposes of irrigation and supports additional rain fed agriculture 
in rural parts of the state. As the river enters the peri-urban and 
municipalities  there  is  an  evident  problem  of  reduction  of  water 
quality and drop in oxygen levels due to pollution caused by solid 
waste  disposal,  waste  water  discharge  and  refuse  from  localities 
along the river being illegally dumped into the Cooum. Within city 
limits,  the  river  is  treated  as  an  urban  sewer.  Therefore,  CRRT, 
along with various other line departments of the State government 
is  undertaking  69  activities  which  are  to  be  completed  in  three 
phases to restore the quality of river water and its ecosystem. The 
proposed and implemented activities are similar to the Adyar River 
restoration project122. 

While restoring Adyar and Cooum Rivers, it is critical to restore 
the  Buckingham  Canal  since  it  crisscrosses  these  two  rivers, 
flowing  through  a  stretch  of  163  km  in  Tamil  Nadu,  and  from 
Ennore to Muttukaadu in Chennai (48 km). Due to urbanization, 
encroachments,  illegal  solid  waste  disposal,  and  lack  of  sewage 
water treatment; this canal has lost its past glory of ferrying and 
cargo movement. On the request of CRRT, TNUIFSL has appointed a 
consultant for the preparation of DPR for restoration of Buckingham 
Canal on similar lines of the above two ongoing projects.

RESILIENCE PILLAR 3:
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS

Historically,  Chennai  has  been  disaster-prone, 
experiencing climate and non-climate related disasters. 
However,  the  frequency  of  disasters  in  Chennai—
specifically,  floods  and  droughts—has 
increased, 
and  its  impact  on  Chennai’s  residents,  economy  and 
infrastructure  is  widespread.  While  integrated  and 
proactive  actions  in  planned  urbanisation,  a  well-
managed  water  system  and  collaborative  urban 

© Adithya Anand - 'Duty Calls', Kilpauk, Chennai Floods 2015

governance can help prevent certain events, or at least 
minimise  their  intensity,  Chennai  must  simultaneously 
prepare  itself  to  face  and  tackle  disasters  when  they 
do  happen.  Special  attention  needs  to  be  given  to 
vulnerable  communities  and  small  businesses,  which 
typically tend to be most affected by disaster events.    

MISSION 3: Making Chennai a prepared city

To minimise the loss and damage resulting from future disaster events, the city will earnestly focus on actions to strengthen 
its preparedness and work to reduce response time by focusing on the following four goals:

1.
2.
3.

4.

Leveraging data and technology to cope with disasters more efficiently.
 Specifically address challenges faced by vulnerable groups living in disaster prone areas.
 Support small and medium scale businesses through a combination of economic and non-economic measures to help
them cope better with disasters.
 Build capacity across government and community to ensure everyone is better prepared in the event of disasters.

LINKS TO INTERNATIONAL POLICIES/ GOALS

The  biggest  challenge  to  enabling  quicker  and  more  efficient 
disaster response is the lack of quality data to inform and direct 
planning and rescue efforts. In the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, 
the  Indian  National  Centre  for  Ocean  Information  Services 
(INCOIS),  Hyderabad  set  up  early  warning  systems  that  alert 
coastal  states  in  the  event  of  undersea  earthquakes  that  may 
trigger  tsunamis123.  However,  no  similar  tool  is  in  place  to  warn 
against  drought,  storm  surges  or  floods.  The  December  2015 
floods in Chennai effectively highlighted how data and technology 
could have drastically reduced the impact of the event on the city. 
Accurate and quality data on, for instance, weather conditions in 
urban areas to predict precipitation magnitude or water flows into 
the  Adyar  and  Cooum  rivers  and  the  Buckingham  Canal  would 
have been extremely useful to take timely and appropriate steps 
in  preparation  for  the  event.  Furthermore,  numerically  robust 
hydrological models and detailed urban flood simulations based 
on accurate data would have also improved city capacity to deal 
with  the  disaster124.  Therefore,  leveraging  accurate  sources  of 
data and data-driven techniques seem imperative for Chennai to 
become a prepared city.   

147

39
Multi-hazard data 
collection & mapping

The  city  will  continue  to  invest  in  collaborative 
efforts  to  collect  and  analyse  good  quality  and 
accurate  data,  and  then  map  and  assess  the  most 
significant  disaster  risks  for  Chennai  cityxxx.  The  first 
step  to  mitigating  disaster  risks  is  to  have  the  right 
data  on  likely  threats  (droughts,  tropical  cyclones, 
storm  surges,  earthquakes  and  tsunamis)  and  on 
regions  and  communities  that  are  at  risk  from  these 
threats.  Therefore,  different  types  of  data  will  be 
collected, 
including  precipitation,  surface  and 
groundwater  levels,  soil  moisture,  stream  flows  and 
sea surface temperature. Since some of the data are 
already  available  or  are  being  collected  by  different 
departments and organisations, collaborations across 
government and private agencies will be critical. The 
data will be spatially mapped and overlaid by data on 
socio-economic  characteristics,  resident  access  to 
various  basic  services  such  as  water,  sanitation  and 
electricity to assess disaster risk and to create detailed 
GIS-based  risk  maps  and  hydrological  models.  This 
project  will  support  government  agencies  like  the 
Tamil  Nadu  State  Disaster  Management  Authority 
(TNSDMA),  and  institutions  like  the  Indian  Institute 
of Technology, Madras (IITM) and Anna University to 
develop  efficient  early  warning  systems  and  make 
urban planning processes data driven. 

xxx According to the Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Plan 
(TNSDMP), the Government of Tamil Nadu has announced that it will 
establish a GIS cell within the Revenue and Disaster Management 
Department, for risk and hazard assessment. This cell will also be 
integrated with early warning systems and other decision support 
systems.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
RiskMap  (www.riskmap.in) 

RiskMap  showcases  how  citizen  reporting  and  social  media  can 
be leveraged to map real-time information during a disaster event. 
Developed by Urban Risk Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
the map was used to great effect during high intensity rainfall events 
between  November  1  and  6,  2017  in  Chennai.  Essentially,  the 
platform connects residents with emergency managers to drastically 
cut down on response times. Through the live map, residents are 
also  able  to  inform  each  other  about  dynamically  changing 
situations in the city and help each other navigate to safety. The 
platform currently works with Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram, and 
also displays real-time sensor information, such as changing water 
levels in flood gauges, monitoring wells and pumping stations.

100RC INSPIRATION: 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The city of Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in Brazil in terms 
of  population  and  GDP,  sits  between  the  sea  and  the  mountains 
facing multiple risks due to urbanisation and climate change. The 
city’s climate adaptation plan identified exposure to sea level rise, 
landslides, urban heat islands, flooding, and prolonged drought as 
some of the major risks that Rio faces. Recognizing the need for 
multi-hazard mapping to assess these disparate risks and analyse 
their  interaction  with  city’s  people  and  infrastructure,  Rio  has 
embarked  on  an  effort  to  develop  multi-hazard  assessment  maps 
using  computational  models,  real-time  sensing,  and  Big  Data. 
Incorporating  the  information  available  from  such  exercises 
strengthens the city’s position to comprehend potential impact, plan 
in advance, target efforts to specific areas, communities etc. While 
the initiative was implemented by Rio Resilient in the early stages, it 
was fully incorporated in the city’s Strategic Plan 2017-2020.

Investments  will  be  made  in  a  GIS-based  flood 
monitoring and forecasting tool to observe long-term 
trends  and  to  help  government,  communities  and 
emergency teams respond more quickly to flooding 
events  and  to  reduce  their  impact  (according  to  the 
TNSDMP). This type of system will comprise of:
telemetry/GPRS  network 

Real-time 
from
stations such as Automatic Weather/Automatic
Rain Gauge stations;

•

• Online  stream  inflow  and  outflow  meters  that

collect data on a continual basis;

• A spatial support system for the Adyar, Cooum,

Kovalam and Kosasthaliyar river basins.

All collected data will be transmitted to a centralised 
control room to provide real-time information for:

Flood mapping;

•
• Analysis of state of surface water systems;
• On-line operation of waterways.

This  will  enable  floods  mapping  and  the  ability 
to  communicate  likely  risks  to  communities.  The 
National Centre for Coastal Research, IITM, IIT Bombay 
and  Anna  University  are  jointly  developing  a  tool  to 
forecast  and  observe  rainfall  levels,  reservoir  and 
river levels, and other parameters. Named CFLOWS, 
this tool is currently being tested.

LINKS TO INTERNATIONAL POLICIES/ GOALS

Disaster  vulnerability  for  the  urban  poor  and  other  vulnerable 
groups 
is  constituted  and  exacerbated  by  socio-economic 
conditions  such  as  poverty,  precarious  livelihoods,  insecure 
housing and dependence on state services. As flood, drought and 
cyclone events increase in frequency and intensity in Chennai, this 
acute  vulnerability  turns  chronic126.  Providing  relief  to  Chennai’s 
vulnerable proved to be a challenge during major disasters such 
as  the  2015  floods  and  the  2004  tsunami.  Innovative  systems 
for  organising  and  distributing  relief  and  rescue  assistance 
were  deployed  by  some  state  agencies  and  NGOs.  However, 
these  were  not  replicated  across  state  agencies,  nor  were  they 
incorporated  into  ongoing  protocols  for  future  response  or 
mitigation efforts. Many NGOs note that the manner of disbursing 
humanitarian  assistance  to  vulnerable  populations 
in  the 
aftermath of disasters undermines the vulnerable communities’ 
dignity and creates a heavy dependence on external assistance, 
often reducing communities to passive recipients. An important 
ongoing challenge, then, is to devise modes of relief distribution 
that maintain and enhance the dignity of vulnerable people.

Disaster response plan for 
vulnerable communities

Differently-abled  people,  children,  women, 
the 
elderly and low-income communities are some of the 
population segments that are typically more affected by 
disasters. Reduced impact, quick and efficient disaster 
response  and  increased  preparedness  is  required  for 
these segments, and can be achieved by formulating 
a  disaster  response  plan  which  includes  information 
on emergency shelters, contact numbers, a list of “dos 
and don’ts” for before, during and after disaster events. 
Therefore, the city will consider developing a targeted 
disaster  response  plan  for  the  vulnerable.  This  plan 
would include the following points: 

a.

Providing sensitive and quick disaster relief that
is appropriate to the needs of different vulnerable 
groups, based on assets and livelihood losses;

b. Assessing  losses  both 

in  terms  of  life  and
property  and  in  terms  of  key  documents  (e.g.
voter ID, school records and property title deeds)
and  restoring  these  critical  resources  more
effectively;

c.

d.

e.

f.

 Providing safe spaces where people and animals
can take shelter in the event of disasters, such as
community  halls/shelters  on  elevated  grounds,
and  ensuring  that  they  are  accessible  to  all,
including the elderly and people with disabilities;

 Providing storage space for key assets;

 Designing  settlement  and  buildings  such  that
they have emergency exits and routes for rescue/
relief operations and evacuation;

 Building  capacity  of  government  personnel
(including National Disaster Response Force and
State Disaster Response Force) to recognise the
diversity of vulnerable communities and provide
appropriate humane and sensitive relief.

This  plan  could  potentially  be  incorporated  into  the 
GCC’s Chennai Disaster Management Plan.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Perumbakkam Community-driven Vulnerability 
Mapping and Disaster Response Plan

With  support  from  the  Resilient  Chennai  office,  Information  and  Resource 
Centre for Urban Deprived Communities (IRCDUC) is working closely with 
residents  of  Perumbakkam,  which  is  one  of  the  largest  resettlement  sites  in 
Chennai,  to  enhance  capacities  and  build  the  resilience  of  the  community, 
especially women and children, to cope with vulnerabilities associated with 
safety and disaster risks. This work involves:

-

-

-

-

Facilitating  formation  of  a  cadre  of  women  leaders  who  will  facilitate
the  community  level  planning  process  for  envisioning  a  safe  space  of
habitation for women and children;
Conducting a survey and organizing a series of workshops to get inputs
from the community on their vulnerability, and inform them about their
roles, responsibilities, and rights;
Assessing  the  larger  community’s  vulnerability  to  disaster  risks  (flood,
fire, droughts etc);
Informing the community of available resources and appropriate steps for
safety during disasters.

The ultimate goal of this exercise is developing a participatory plan for safe 
habitation and improved disaster response that will be shared with relevant 
public and civic agencies for implementation.

100RC INSPIRATION: 
Semarang, Indonesia

As a port city Semarang is facing pressing challenges relating to tidal and flash 
floods which are being aggravated by climate change, sea level rise, coastal 
erosion, and land subsidence. Supported by the Rockefeller Foundation’s Asian 
Cities  Climate  Resilience  Network  (ACCCRN),  Semarang  has  developed  a 
flood early warning system that requires effective coordination between key 
stakeholders  across  governmental  departments  and  sectors,  including  the 
planning, water resources, meteorological and disaster management agencies.
What  makes  Semarang  stand  out  as  an  inspiration  is  that  their  effort  uses 
simulations  to  prepare  communities  to  know  what  would  happen  and  what 
should be done in the event of a flood. For instance, in 2014 such a simulation 
was carried out for the Wonosari community. The simulation involved a training 
exercise for the community starting from evacuation alerts with a siren, and 
a community disaster team evacuating the people to the shelter, which was 
located on high ground.  Once all members were at the shelter, the exercise 
ended with a community-wide debrief. Leaders shared reflections pointing out 
issues they saw arise and any improvements needed in the procedure. As such 
Semarang’s effort highlights the need for improving the awareness building 
element within disaster management processes.

xxxii  IRCDUC (Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities) is a Chennai-based consortium of community-based 
groups and individuals from different sectors working to assert the rights of urban deprived communities.
xxxiii Both these organisations are Chennai-based and work actively on the ground, to uplift the lives of vulnerable communities.

The city will consider developing a capacity building 
programme that would focus on the need for providing 
relief and help that is sensitive to the diversity of needs 
across  vulnerable  populations.  The  programme 
would  target  the  communities  themselves  to  deal 
with disasters collectively. It will include elements of 
skills development, training and technology transfer 
such  as  training  groups  of  local  volunteers  (who  are 
familiar  with  the  residents  and  vice  versa)  to  assist 
official  relief  efforts  and  conducting  safety  drills  on 
dos and don’ts during different types of disastersxxxiv.

Tamil  Nadu’s  well-established  Micro,  Small  and  Medium 
Enterprise (MSME) sector has a diversified portfolio of industries 
for  domestic  and 
includes  textile, 
electronics,  engineering,  auto  components,  leather,  chemicals

Metropolitan Area is ranked highest in the state in terms of new 
firms  entering  the  sector,  registering  a  50%  growth  rate  in  the 
number of MSMEs between 2007 and 2008 and 2014 and 2015128. 
Yet,  even  as  the  sector  grows  economically,  it  remains  highly 
vulnerable  to  disasters.  While  large  companies  tend  to  have 
a  disaster  contingency  plan,  MSMEs  often  do  not.  MSMEs  are 
particularly vulnerable to disruptions caused by natural disasters 
because of the limited resources they usually have and because 
of the informality of the sector129. For MSMEs to build resilience 
to  disaster  events  they  need  to  overcome  obstacles  relating 
to  inadequate,  unreliable  and  untimely  access  to  finance  and 
insurance at all times, and more so after disaster events.

Strengthening insurance support by 
offering specific disaster insurance

Insurance support to MSMEs post-disaster is largely 
unavailable for many firms. This is particularly true for 
MSMEs.  Even  those  firms  that  do  possess  coverage 
have found it to be inadequate, because a very small 
percent  of  total  claims  are  actually  met.  Therefore, 
insurance  support  needs  to  be  strengthened  by 
offering  specific  disaster 
insurance  plans  with 
low  premiums.  The  insurance  could  function  as 
does  the  existing  Pradhan  Mantri  Suraksha  Bima 
Yojana  scheme,  which  is  offered  through  banks  and 
administered  by  public  sector  general  insurance 
companies. In addition, the city will consider working 
with  the  Insurance  Regulatory  and  Development 
Authority and the State MSME department to ensure 
that  insurance  companies  release  above  50%  of 
claims  on  existing  policies  and  that  claims  are

While  MSMEs  may  not  individually  possess  the 
resources required to cope with major disasters, they 
can  leverage  their  collective  resources  during  such 
events. Together, MSMEs can create a foundation that 
maintains  a  pool  of  funds  collected  from  all  MSMEs 
based on their income. This can be accessed in times 
of need. In addition, the foundation will help develop

CHENNAI ASPIRATION: 
Business Continuity Plan for MSMEs

Companies can combat natural, economic, and geopolitical disasters by devising a comprehensive risk 
management protocol through Business Continuity Plans (BCP). Although this task may seem daunting, 
over the last decade, BCP have helped firms throughout Chennai safeguard against catastrophe. More 
specifically, BCPs can help MSMEs determine how to allocate their limited resources in a manner that 
both protects their business model from shocks and optimizes financial performance. 

The primary purpose of a BCP is to ensure that a business’s employees, clients, and operations can 
withstand incremental disruptions. It should plan for all potential risks a company faces, including 
internal challenges such as resource availability, People, Infrastructure, Network (PIN), and external 
setbacks such as floods, droughts or earthquakes. 

Therefore, a BCP should have a defined scope, which could consist of a department, service, product, 
or branch or the overall firm, by assessing which core business areas are key to their companies’ 
survival and by considering what types of risks are material to those areas. Formulating the plan 
would involve conducting a simple impact analysis to address questions including; what penalties the 
firm would have to pay if it failed to carry out its contract, which processes or activities help deliver 
key products and services following a disruption, and what is maximum time process or activities 
(especially those dependent on an external vendor) could be down before the business is impacted. In 
addition, a BCP should also include:

a. A strategy to ensure effective response to emergencies that could include: evacuating to ensure
employee  safety;  setting  up  an  ‘Emergency  Operation  Center’  and  carrying  out  situation
assessment;  confirming  employee  safety;  devising  measures  to  restrict  further  damage  and
carrying out damage assessment; and reporting damage.

b. A  continuity  strategy  that  enables  it  to  deliver  its  product  or  services  under  abnormal
circumstances. For e.g. to maintain operations, MSMEs can rent undamaged business centers,
ask employees to work from home, rely on clients’ resources, or strike reciprocal agreements with
peer firms, whereby each company can use the other’s facility during crisis situations. MSMEs
with multiple branches can transfer activities to its unharmed offices. However, if none of these
strategies are viable, MSMEs should, at the very least, set aside reserve cash as part of their
budgets for potential disasters, to bounce back quickly.

Leaders  must  then  select  a  senior  level  employee  to  oversee  the  BCP.  Typically,  this  employee  is 
a  Business  Manager  or  Operations  Manager,  or  a  Managing  Director  who  should  be  able  to 
communicate the collective agenda of the group of MSMEs to all relevant junior staffers, to implement 
and review the BCP effectively. For MSMEs that are preparing a collective BCP, a representative from 
each MSME or a proportionate number of representatives can perform this function. As businesses 
grow, they should continue to update their BCP.

LINKS TO INTERNATIONAL POLICIES/ GOALS

One  of  the  biggest  challenges  in  limiting  disaster  impact  is 
ensuring  that  government  and  community  both  have  the 
capacity to respond quickly to disasters. Capacity, in the disaster 
context,  as  defined  by  the  UNISDR  in  2017  “refers  to  all  the 
strengths, attributes and resources available within a community, 
organization or society to manage and reduce disaster risks and 
strengthen resilience”132. Consequently, building capacity should 
not  involve  just  the  provision  of  various  types  of  training  and 
learning, but should also encompass strengthening of institutions, 
raising of political and citizen awareness, and development of a 
wider and more enabling environment for quick disaster response 
at  both  the  institutional  and  individual  levels.  Preparedness, 
and  the  knowledge  of  ‘what  to  do’  just  before,  during  and  after 
disasters  was  markedly  lacking  when  floods  hit  Chennai  in 
December  2015.  This  was  true  for  individuals,  the  government 
and  non-governmental  organisations.  Therefore,  the  challenge 
is  to  build  capacity  specifically  around  how  to  anticipate  (e.g. 
raising  awareness  on  risks,  risk  education,  participating  in  risk 
assessments,  etc.),  cope  with  (e.g.  training  in  first  aid,  securing 
homes, learning to swim, etc.) and resist (e.g. designing evacuation 
strategies, stock-piling emergency equipment etc.) disasters133.

165

49
Engage with community-led 
organisations to act as first responders

Local  volunteer-led  organisations  already  play  a 
critical role in responding quickly to disasters through 
rescue and relief efforts. This was evident during the 
December 2015 floods, when large groups of people 
collaborated  on  social  media  platforms  to  provide 
relief, so much so that it caught the attention of several

Disaster warning

information 

According  to  the  TNSDMP,  the  state  has  a  well-
equipped  State  Emergency  Operations  Centre 
(SEOC)  that  gets  information  on  significant  events 
and  disseminates 
through  multiple 
channels  to  the  districts  which  in  turn  alert  line 
departments136. However, information does not easily 
get  disseminated  to  communities,  particularly  those 
in  remote  locations.  Therefore,  the  implementation 
of  a  disaster  warning  announcement  system  in  key 
locations that are connected to the SEOC and to local 
emergency control centres will significantly improve 
communication around threats. Existing flood control 
rooms  can  be  mandated  to  carry  out  this  task, 
irrespective of the disaster.

CHENNAI ASPIRATION: 
Ham Radio: Complementing the 
Disaster Warning System of Chennai

Amateur radio is a popular service that brings people together from 
across town and around the world without the internet or cell phones. 
Not only are HAM radios fun, social, and educational, they can be a 
lifeline during times of need.
When  regular  communication  channels  fail  during  disasters,  HAMs 
can help public service agencies bolster emergency relief efforts. In 
fact,  with  a  simple  12.6  D.C.  volt  car  battery,  even  radio  amateurs 
can establish vital first lines of communication if cellular and online 
connection is limited. By stringing emergency antennas through trees 
or other available supports, regular civilians can use HAM radio to 
keep people connected throughout crises.
For instance, during the Indian Ocean Tsunami, HAM radio operators 
provided the only means of communication for almost 6 days before 
regular  communication  systems  were  restored.  Even  during  the 
devastating floods that drowned Chennai in December of 2015, HAMs 
allowed aid and medical support to reach damaged areas while mobile 
phones and land lines were broken.
Individuals can interface with other HAMs by using microphones or 
by linking the radio system to a computer or tablet to send data, texts, 
images, or Morse code, which remains incredibly popular.
Resilient  Chennai  hopes  to  identify  a  HAM  operator  for  each  ward 
and connect him/her to RWAs in flood prone localities via a two-way 
long range walkie-talkie. The plan is to also connect HAM operators 
with  the  Department  of  Revenue Admin  &  Disaster  Mitigation,  and 
the  Control  Room  at  GCC.  This  proposal  would  enable  the  city  to 
seamlessly intertwine its existing disaster management protocols with 
its HAM radio network. 

A  ward  map  with  contact  details  of  HAM  Radio  operators  in  flood 
prone wards is being developed.

In  most  cases,  communities  lack  the  knowledge 
required  for  effective  risk  reduction.  Therefore,  a 
widespread  and  sustained  awareness  campaign 
could  be  carried  out  to  build  community  capacity

elements would include creating awareness on:  

a.

b.

c.

(cyclones,  earthquakes,
A  range  of  climate 
(industrial  fires,
droughts)  and  non-climate 
oil  spills,  epidemics)  risks  to  the  city,  with  a
general  understanding  of  vulnerable  areas  and
communities likely to be at risk;
 What to do during a disaster, emergency contact
information and relief centre locations based on
GCC's CDMP 2018;
 Insurance and economic tools that communities
and business can leverage to protect themselves.

The campaign could also cover talks or demonstrations 
at  educational  institutions,  businesses,  social  and 
print  media  and  places  where  people  congregate 
such as malls and theatres, and will be conducted in 
Tamil, English and Hindi

Mapping existing community infrastructure 
and creating new investments where needed

Communities can equip themselves for effective and 
quick  disaster  risk  reduction.  Key  to  do  this  will  be 
investing in community infrastructure that is durable 
and safe. For example, community halls and shelters 
on elevated grounds, storage spaces for key assets, 
maintaining  clear  escape  routes  for  rescue/relief 
operations and evacuation. Some of this infrastructure 
already  exists.  Therefore,  the  city  could  create  a 
comprehensive  map  of  existing  community  assets 
to  identify  locations  where  new  assets  are  needed, 
specifically,  in  areas  that  are  prone  to  floods  and/or 
storm surges.

RESILIENCE PILLAR 4:
GOVERNANCE ECOSYSTEM

© PlaneMad/ Wiki – Panoramic view of Chennai from Madras High Court

The  ideal  city  governance  machinery  is  grounded  in 
strong collaboration between public agencies, private 
entities  and  citizens.  A  broad-based  participatory  and 
transparent system for making decisions and managing 
resources is key to safeguarding city resident interests 
and  addressing  their  concerns.  The  challenges  in 
Chennai’s  governance  relate  not  so  much  to  a  lack 
of  knowledge  or  expertise,  but  rather  to  poor  levels 
of  collaboration  within  public  agencies  and  across 
public,  private  and  civic  agencies  when  governing 
and enforcing laws and rules. While Chennai needs to 
institutionalize effective channels for broad participation 
in  public  decision-making  processes,  it  also  needs  to 
raise awareness and willingness among citizens to take 
responsibility for their actions and the future of their city. 

Irrespective of the quality of plans or strategies, citizen 
support  is  essential  to  their  effective  implementation 
and enforcement in a city of 8.65 million. In a survey of 
478 Chennai citizens, 66% vouched that there is ample 
scope  for  citizens  to  engage  with  government,  while 
just  23%  acknowledged  having  ever  interacted  with 
their local level government officersxxxvi. This highlights 
a  need  for  strengthening  social  capital  and  civil 
society actor capacities and a need for expanding and 
protecting spaces for people’s participation in political 
and public life. This will lay the foundation for building 
citizens trust in their government and fostering a more 
resilient governance ecosystem.

MISSION 4: Together, we lift Chennai

It is crucial that efforts to transform Chennai and render it more resilient to current and future shocks and stresses are led by 
government, civil society and industries together. The city will strengthen existing means and create new ones to garner buy-
in and active involvement from a wide range of stakeholders so that Chennai becomes a truly co-owned and co-managed city. 
The following goals will help achieve this mission, to lift Chennai together:

1.

system,  with 

Chennai’s governance structure comprises of multiple agencies, 
including  the  GCC,  CMWSSB,  TNSCB,  CMDA,  TNHB,  CRRT, 
TANGEDCO  and  the  Revenue  Department.  This  governance 
system  is  poly-centric  in  nature,  i.e.  according  to  Pethe  et  al. 
(2012)137    it  is  “multi-level  (involving  local,  state  and  national 
agencies  within  the  federal  set-up),  multi-type  (with  nested, 
overlapping  and  fragmented  jurisdictions),  multi-sectoral  (with 
various  public  and  private  organizations,  including  civil  society 
and  others)  and  multi-functional  (with  units  performing  specific 
functions)”.  However,  unlike  a  truly  poly-centric  system,  which 
allows  for  cooperation  between  organisations  and  encourages 
competition138,  Chennai’s 
its  overlapping 
responsibilities  and 
jurisdictions  among  different  agencies, 
actually results in government inefficiencies139. Further, while the 
74th amendment to India’s Constitution formally recognizes Urban 
Local  Bodies  (ULBs)  as  autonomous  elected  bodies,  assigning 
them  certain  functions,  the  state  government  only  devolves 
limited powers to these ULBs, including to the GCC. In addition, 
hardly  any  formal  arrangement  exists  for  ensuring  coordination 
(including  data  sharing)  or  cooperation  between  and  within 
multiple  organizations  working  at  the  same  level.  For  example, 
Chennai’s  Public  Works  Department  (PWD)  possesses  village-
level maps on drainage channels and water bodies but these were 
only  recently  transferred  to  the  CMDA’s  Master  Plan  Unit,  who 
themselves are tasked with planning for the Chennai Metropolitan 
Area (CMA)140. Institutional spaces that facilitate regular meeting 
and discussion between departments within and across agencies 
are  also  missing.  Therefore,  to  facilitate  efficient,  equitable  and 
effective  governance  that  builds  Chennai’s  resilience,  ensuring 
significant improvement in coordination, communication and data 
sharing within and across public departments is crucial.

Create an urban data observatory 
for better governance

The Resilient Chennai Team is facilitating discussions 
between the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), 
Chennai Smart City Limited (CSCL), Madras Chamber 
of  Commerce  and  Industry  (MCCI)  and  Center  for 
Urbanization,  Buildings,  and  Environment  (CUBE), 
Indian  Institute  of  Technology,  Madras  (IITM)  to  set 
up a data observatory that will serve as a repository 
for  accurate  and  frequently  updated,  local,  spatial 
and non-spatial data that can be used as a decision 
support system for Chennai city. The observatory will 
collate  relevant  information  from  all  departments 
involved  in  Chennai  city  governance,  including  the 
GCC,  CRRT,  CMDA,  CMWSSB  and  TNSCB,  and  will 
consist  of  both  a  physical  data  centre  and  a  virtual 
platform. The role of the physical centre will include 
coordination  between  different  stakeholders 
to 
collect  data,  frequently  update  data,  train  staff  on 
data  management,  develop  models  for  scenario 
planning  and  develop  a  learning  centre  to  educate 
public officials about data-driven planning. The role of 
the virtual platform will be to analyse and represent 
collected data through maps, tables and other forms. 
The  virtual  platform  will  also  allow  users  to  interact 
with each other through blogs and discussion forums. 
All government departments who contribute data will 
have access to it through the data centre.

Chennai Scenarios Project

Funded by Tamil Nadu State Planning Commission (Government), 
Cholamandalam Finance (private sector) and Tata Trusts (Non- 
profit  arm  of  private  sector),  Okapi  Advisory  Services,  Centre 
for  Buildings,  Urbanization  and  the  Environment  (CUBE),  IIT 
Madras  and  Fields  of  View  have  been  working  on  a  project  to 
support  integrated  planning  for  water,  land  use,  and  waste 
management  in  Chennai.  One  of  the  primary  outcomes  of  this 
work includes a set of Agent Based Models (ABMs) that function 
as  a  platform  for  relevant  government  agencies  like  CMWSSB, 
CMDA, PWD etc. to store, upgrade, and share data, and use the 
data to develop different scenarios and compare trade-offs across 
a series of parameters (such as waste generated, water demand, 
etc.), to make informed decisions. The ABMs will therefore allow 
public  agencies  to  better  coordinate  amongst  themselves  better 
and take decisions in a more integrated fashion considering all 
the interlinkages between water, waste and land use related needs 
and challenges of the city. By customizing and scaling up this work 
to  include  all  public  agencies  involved in  the  city’s  governance 
as part of this integrated planning platform, a more collaborative 
and well-coordinated city planning process can be supported.

The project would help integrate environment,

which is critical for the city to grow sustainably 
(Healthy Urbanisation – Pillar 1).

The  CMDA  already  coordinates  with  several 
government  departments  and  non-government 
representatives  for  planning  for  the  CMA.  However, 
the extent and manner of coordination has not been 
very effective and is often restricted to project-based 
efforts.  Therefore,  the  city  needs  to  explore  ways  to 
ensure sustained coordination between departments 
that  govern  Chennai  city.  For  this,  CMDA  could 
work  closely  with  the  planning  department  within 
GCC  as  facilitators  of  government  coordination  and 
collaboration for all relevant activities. This could be 
done by:

a. Conducting regular (monthly) meetings between
different  levels  of  department  staff  such  as
heads of department, superintendent engineers,
assistant  engineers  and 
line  department
personnel,  etc.,  so  that  each  is  updated  on
current  work  and  progress.  This  will  also  help
departments  identify  projects  where  they  can
collaborate;

b.

c.

 Identifying  potential  non-state  actors 
that
can  collaborate  with  government  on  research
projects as needed;

 Conducting  capacity-building  workshops  and
training  programmes  for  government  staff  on
ways  to  improve  coordination.  This  will  also
include training programmes for Information and
Technology  (IT)  cells  within  each  department
around  the  use  of  technology  for  data  sharing
and collection;

d.

 Highlighting  best  practices  around  coordination
and collaboration in the monthly meetings.

100RC INSPIRATION: 
Ramallah, Palestine

Acknowledging the complexity involved in fostering participatory 
decision-making  processes  in  governance,  especially  in  a  place 
like Ramallah, where democratic governance is a relatively new 
idea, the city has embarked on developing a 10-year plan of action 
for  greater  community  engagement  in  government  decision-
making, initially at the municipal level. This plan would provide 
a  long  term  roadmap  to  guide  the  working  relationships,  and 
improve regional collaboration between the municipality and all 
other stakeholders. This will help the city achieve a collaborative 
or co-designed future for the city and its surroundings.

The  city  plans  to  use  international  frameworks  such  as  the 
International  Association 
for  Public  Participation  (IAP2) 
spectrum, to identify longterm objectives for supporting greater 
stakeholder  participation,  and  use  different  methods  including 
surveys,  social  media,  public  meetings,  focus  groups,  television 
advertising and trials of participatory budgeting to reach out to 
multiple  stakeholders,  including  the  most  marginalized.  While 
the city identified the need for a longer-term plan to address the 
complex issue of participatory governance, it has also identified 
some  immediate  and  tangible  initiatives  for  this  cause.  For 
instance, establishing a Resilience Council Advisory Board: this 
would  be  a  representative  group  of  stakeholders  from  various 
sectors who will meet regularly, review municipal projects, plans 
and developments, and offer their candid suggestions for ensuring 
greater resilience of these projects.

In  addition,  Ramallah  also  highlights  the  need  for  a  centralize 
data  system  with  a  comprehensive  inventory  of  data  that  will 
support evidence-based decisions and promote accountability and 
transparency in governance.

The extent of devastation caused by the December 2015 floods 
proved that unplanned growth and poor enforcement of planning 
and environmental laws pose a severe threat to Chennai residents. 
Therefore, 
is  crucial  that  government  departments  take 
immediate steps to strictly enforce legislation and to protect life, 
property and natural ecosystems to minimize the impact of future 
disasters.  To  do  this,  government  departments  must  overcome 
challenges  relating  to  data,  technology,  finance,  capacity  and 
human  resources.  Groundwater  and  solid  waste  management 
are examples of challenges where monitoring and enforcement 
are insufficient. In terms of groundwater management, CMWWSB 
cannot  monitor  ground  water  extraction  without  data  on  the 
number  of  existing  household  and  commercial  borewells. 
Moreover,  CMWSSB’s  “hydrogeology  wing”  which  manages 
groundwater  and  rain  water  harvesting,  is  short-staffed.  GCC 
faces similar human resource constraints in its SWM department, 
particularly  in  terms  of  the  number  of  conservancy  workers 
tasked  for  door-to-door  collection.  Therefore,  the  city  will  work 
towards strengthening its capacity to monitor and enforce laws 
more efficiently by procuring more data, technology and human 
resources. While monitoring and enforcement in general require 
strengthening, specific actions have been formulated in sectors of 
water and solid waste management, in accordance with Chennai 
city’s resilience challenges.

Dedicated funding for SWM monitoring,

TIMEFRAME
Long term

STATUS
New / Proposed

Setting  aside  a  portion  of  the  GCC  budget  for 
monitoring and enforcement is critical to implement 
the  2016  SWM  Rules  and  to  ensure  that  existing 
projects  continue.  The  GCC  already  sets  aside  a 
small  amount  in  its  yearly  budget  for  SWM  capital 
expenditure but it has not done so for O&M. Therefore, 
the city proposes to accommodate SWM O&M under 
the “revenue expenditure head”, in the form of a fund 
for SWM. This fund can finance operations to monitor 
and  enforce  rules  related  to  solid  waste  generation 
and help with SWM O&M, including waste segregation, 
maintaining compost pits, etc. O&M costs can also be 
covered by user fees and charges from all bulk waste 
generators.

Decentralised enforcement 
cell for SWM and RWH

Despite 
legislation  which  makes  solid  waste 
dumping  and  non-compliance  with  RWH  rules 
punishable offences under law, there is limited actual 
enforcement  of  these  laws,  primarily  because  of  a 
lack of human resources for ensuring comprehensive 
enforcement. Therefore, the city will consider setting 
up decentralised enforcement cells at the ward/zonal 
level  to  enforce  SWM  and  RWH  laws.  These  cells 
would comprise of dedicated personnel from GCC and 
CMWSSB to ensure that citizens comply with the laws. 
The cells can have access to appropriate technology 
that will help in enforcement, can be empowered to 
conduct  surprise  visits  in  their  respective  wards  to 
check  compliance,  and  can  respond  to  complaints 
through telecommunication.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Antariksh SMART Bins

Overflowing bins are a common problem in Indian cities. With a 
vision  to  clear  every  public  bin  before  it  overflows,  Antariksh 
Waste Ventures Private Ltd., based in Chennai, has designed and 
developed AirBin™ - smart Internet of Things (IoT) powered waste 
bins that are linked with mobile apps. The company’s pilot project 
in  Valmiki  Nagar,  Chennai,  involves  digitising  waste  collection, 
segregation, operations and disposal system. The project leverages 
the strength of mobile and radio-based technologies such as apps 
and IoT devices to monitor solid waste levels in the bins.

In Valmiki Nagar, the company has integrated five public bins with 
its  AirBin™  systems,  collecting  over  1,00,000  data  points  since 
initiation.  The  supervisor  of  the  local  sanitation  team  receives 
hourly alerts about the levels of solid waste disposed in the bins, 
and other periodic alerts related to bin repairs, worker attendance 
summary, etc. Accordingly, if the bins are full prior to the scheduled 
pick-up time, the supervisor can plan an additional pick-up, thereby 
preventing overflow of the bin. For accurate data collection, the bin 
area is marked for precise re-positioning to their designated space, 
once a compactor truck collects the waste. 

This initiative is an example of how technology and data analytics 
can help municipalities manage day-to-day operations and optimize 
collection of waste long term. This project was possible with support 
from Rialto Enterprises Private Ltd., ATOS India Private Ltd., IIT 
Madras Incubation Cell and initiated by Resilient Chennai.

Economic measures for 
citizen compliance

Through different government departments, the city 
could  explore  introduction  of  economic  measures 
(negative  and  positive  incentives)  to  ensure  that  the 
public  complies  with  existing  rules  and  regulations. 
These  incentives  could  include  one-time  incentives 
such  as  fines  for  non-compliance  (e.g.  for  littering 
and traffic violations), tax subsidies or rebates (e.g. for 
consumers  who  dispose  of  their  waste  properly  or 
engage in tree planting activities), low-interest loans 
for environment-friendly capital equipment (e.g. solar 
panels)  and  deposit  refund  schemes  (for  e-waste  or 
plastic bottles, etc.). Or other, not one-time incentives 
like 
increasing  property  tax  and  then  providing 
inducements  in  the  form  of  tax  reductions  to  home 
owners  who  have  installed  RWH,  recycling  and/or 
solar PV systems.

Invest in technology and data for

TIMEFRAME
Short term

STATUS
New / Proposed

The city will consider investing in data and technology 
for more effective water management, and monitoring 
and enforcement of water related legislation. This can 
include collating and archiving data on the historical 
and  current  status  of  water  bodies  in  a  usable 
format,  which  can  inform  planning  and  restoration 
efforts.  Or,  the  O&M  wing  within  CMWSSB  can  use 
new  user  information  (collected  by  the  registration 
department) for monitoring RWH compliance, waste 
water treatment and dual-piping mandates if they are 
in an appropriate digital format. Currently, new users 
must  self-declare  that  they  will  comply  with  these 
mandates  when  they  apply  for  water  and  sewage 
connections with CMWSSB. The registration forms for 
new  connections  are  manually  converted  to  digital 
form  by  the  CMWSSB’s  “Registration  Department”. 
Therefore,  an  electronic  management  system  that 
allows  users  to  upload  necessary  documents  and 
pay  fees  online  will  help  reduce  human  error  in 
data  conversion  and  can  automatically  be  sent  to 
the  O&M  wing  and  the  respective  ward  offices  for 
monitoring. This data can also be fed into the “urban 
data  observatory”  that  aims  to  support  data  driven 
decision making in the water sector.

Link project funding to 
impact assessments

Government  projects  are  usually  evaluated  against 
project  goals  that  may  not  be  related  to  social  or 
environmental  impacts.  While  all  projects  include  a 
mandatory  environment  and  social  framework  that 
anticipates  impact  prior  to  project  implementation, 
the  actual  impact  often  varies,  and  is  not  assessed 
or linked to project goals. Therefore, a more effective 
means of ensuring that projects don’t have high social 
or environmental costs would be to carry out impact 
assessments during and after project implementation, 
with  fund  disbursements  tied  to  the  assessments. 
Impact assessments should be conducted by a group 
of  independent  evaluators  from  the  public,  private, 
civic and academic sectors.

Participatory governance is vital for making Chennai enlightened, 
just and integrated. Currently, the extent of engagement between 
government  and  non-state  actors  (citizens,  CBOs, 
industry, 
academia etc.) is limited. On the one hand, government agencies 
perceive academic institutions, NGOs and citizen groups as being 
too critical. On the other hand, Chennai citizens feel that they “do 
not have the power to make a difference” and that there is a “lack 
of  communication”  from  the  governmentxxxvi.  To  foster  a  more 
inclusive  environment  for  public  participation,  these  challenges 
need  to  be  addressed.  Citizens  need  to  feel  valued  while  also 
responsible  for  their  actions.  Civil  society  needs  to  better 
recognize government limitations, and government needs to be 
less  intimidating  and  more  open  to  comments,  criticisms  and 
feedback from non-state actors. This requires creating spaces and 
introducing mechanisms for citizen engagement where citizens, 
communities  and 
industry  can  actively  and  systematically 
interact with government to collectively take decisions that affect 
everyday lives, and makes citizens aware of their responsibilities 
and  the  impact  of  their  actions  on  the  environment,  on  other 
citizens and on city infrastructure. Therefore, a set of actions can 
be organised around:

A. Strengthening means of communication
B. Encouraging citizen engagement
C. Building public awareness

Strengthen the “Namma 
Chennai” app

The Namma Chennai mobile application was launched 
by  the  GCC  in  the  beginning  of  2018,  essentially 
as  a  means  for  systematic  grievance  redressal 
where  government  can  track  and  respond  to  citizen 
complaints  on  civic  issues.  At  present,  the  app  also 
includes  services  such  as  viewing  birth  and  death 
certificates and status of property tax collection and 
important civic news. GCC and Chennai Smart City Ltd 
(CSCL) can collectively explore improving the app and 
consequently the manner in which GCC communicates 
with its citizens.  Specific improvements can include: 
creating a space in the app for GCC to communicate 
specifically with RWAs, providing information around 
existing  rules  such  as  the  plastic  ban  and  links  to 
relevant agencies, uploading videos and documents 
of important announcements in sign language and in 
braille for persons with hearing and visual disabilities 
respectively  and  providing  details  about  upcoming 
public meetings. Finally, more awareness would have 
to be created among city residents about the app and 
its functions.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
#VoiceofPeople

Ward 181 in Zone 13 under Greater Chennai Corporation, is fairly 
well-governed.  However,  ‘governance’  in  the  ward  is  restricted 
to a reactive process where citizens complain to local authorities 
if there is a disruption of services such as electricity, solid waste 
collection or water. Further, like most other wards in the city, Ward 
181 has not seen sustained or future-proofed development and its 
residents are unaware of their rights or responsibilities. This has 
resulted in reduced interaction with and expectations from the local 
government, with both groups at continual tension with each other.

This situation drove the citizen-led group #VoiceOfPeople (#VoP) to 
‘reclaim their ward’ by exercising their right as citizens to interact 
with the governing body in a positive manner, to bring about change 
in their living environment. As a starting point to understand the 
demographics of ward administration, citizens’ expectations from 
administrators and the government, and the mechanics of delivery 
of  these  expectations,  #VOP  conducted  an  extensive  survey  and 
several  focussed  group  discussions  (FDGs)  with  ward  residents 
including  the  lower  income  group  communities.  The  survey  also 
served  as  a  tool  for  people  to  understand  their  own  role  in  the 
governance process, and the importance of active participation in 
the same.

The  outcome  of  these  interactions  is  the  creation  of  a  ‘citizen 
manifesto’  that  details  the  expectations  from  government  and 
how  ward  residents  can  support  and  work  with  the  local  elected 
representative  to  improve  conditions  in  the  ward  through  a 
participatory and transparent process.

Strengthen “open

Currently, 
the  Tamil  Nadu  state  government’s 
e-governance  website  provides  a  list  of  services,
including procuring legal heir certificates and income
certificates  that  citizens  can  access  online.  The
objective of the website is to make government services 
accessible  to  all.  While  this  makes  it  convenient  for
citizens  to  collect  forms,  the  e-governance  website
could also be leveraged to build trust among citizens
by  keeping  citizens  informed  about  other  services
and  by  providing  access  to  data.  The  city  can  work
with  the  Tamil  Nadu  IT  Department  to  include  the
following on e-governance website:

•

•

a list of upcoming public hearings on policies and
projects;
an  inventory  of  government  welfare  schemes
by  various  departments  and  details  on  types  of
government-owned data that is publicly available 
and where it can be found.

The city can also create awareness about this portal 
on  other  regularly-accessed  government  websites 
such  as  the  portals  for  payment  of  electricity,  water 
and property tax, booking metro water tanks, etc.

Chennai  Smart  City  Ltd  (CSCL)  can  lead  an  initiative 
to  improve  communication  between  government, 
corporate actors and citizens to enable easier access 
to CSR funding. This could be done, for instance, by 
setting up a centre within government to coordinate 
between  a)  various  departments  and  the  private 
sector  and  b)  citizens  and  the  private  sector.  The 
centre’s primary aim would be to coordinate between 
companies, government departments and citizens to 
tap CSR funding. The centre will also host a website 
that provides details of initiatives where CSR funding is 
being sought, details of how corporate actors can get 
involved in government activities and how interested 
citizens  can  volunteer  for  projects.  Additionally,  the 
city could work with partners in industry such as the 
Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) to 
encourage their members to be a part of this initiative.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Eyes on the Canal

The 800 km Buckingham Canal, built in phases between 1800 and 1882, is a manmade, 
saltwater, navigation canal that runs parallel to the Coromandel Coast, connecting the 
three rivers (Kosasthalaiyar, Cooum, and Adyar) that flow through Chennai. Although 
the canal was once an idyllic water body with lush, green edges capable of managing 
floodwaters. Today it faces severe pollution from untreated sewage and solid waste, and 
has been severely encroached upon, compromising its width and carrying capacity over 
long stretches within the CMA. 

Eyes  on  the  Canal,  facilitated  by  GIZ  India  and  Urban  Design  Collective,  was  an 
exercise  in  participatory  planning  to  make  Buckingham  Canal  a  liveable  place  for 
the residents of Chennai. The initiative involved various activities such as awareness 
walks,  community  engagement  meetings  and  an  open-ideas  competition  to  generate 
interest and ownership of the canal. From November 2018 to March 2019, the three 
winners of Eyes on the Canal’s design competition — Team Sponge, Team Studio POD 
and Team Blank Slate — developed project proposals through a series of stakeholder 
engagements. Their concepts have been compiled into three reports, which will inform 
future efforts to revive 3.5 km of Buckingham Canal.

Incentives and competitions 
to induce citizen responsibility

The  city  can  explore  various  ways  of  incentivising 
citizens  to  engage  in  and  take  ownership  of  their 
wards  and  neighbourhoods.  Incentives  could  be  in 
the form of gift vouchers for citizens who, for instance, 
plant and maintain the largest number of trees in their 
neighbourhood or for secondary school children who 
help  direct  traffic  around  their  school  (if  the  school 
is in a neighbourhood with less traffic). Competitions 
could  also  be  conducted  in  schools,  wards  and 
neighbourhoods including for best street art design, 
cleanest school or ward, most energy/water efficient 
school/  ward,  etc.,  to  encourage  citizens  to  take 
greater  interest  and  responsibility  managing  their 
own surroundings.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Swachh ('Clean') Beach 
Project, Thiruvanmiyur

In  2015,  New  Beach  Road,  a  densely  populated  area  of  one 
sq.  km  by  the  Thiruvanmiyur  beachfront  was  chosen  by  Rialto 
Enterprises, a Chennai based global business partner of Procter 
& Gamble Co. for its CSR initiative - the Swachh ('Clean') Beach 
project. The project aimed to transform the beach front by bringing 
together  the  local  residents,  Greater  Chennai  Corporation, 
Ramky Enviro (contracted Municipal Waste Collector), Chennai 
Traffic Police, Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, CMWSSB and the 
Forest Department. This project has tackled issues of solid waste 
management  by  monitoring  waste  collection  by  setting  up  more 
bins, and mitigated flooding by redirecting storm and rain water 
from roads to ground water recharge pits consequently raising the 
water  table.  Furthermore,  Rialto  has,  planted  hundreds  of  tree 
saplings and ornamental shrubs along walk ways, ensured that the 
area is well-lit by erecting two high-mast lights and replaced LEDs 
in existing street lamps, and constructed (and currently maintains) 
two free bio toilets on the beach. At the end of 2015, The Swachh 
Beach  project  was  recognized  by  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office 
(PMO) as one of the 'six most dynamic Swachh Bharat citizens' 
projects'.  Further,  in  2017,  a  team  from  the  PMO  paid  another 
surprise visit to the area and reported that not only was the project 
alive, it had grown even more robust since the team's first visit, two 
years earlier.

CHENNAI INSPIRATION: 
Work by Citizen consumer and 
civic Action Group (CAG)

CAG is a non-profit, non-political and professional organization 
that  has  been  “protecting  citizens’  rights  in  consumer  and 
environmental issues and promoting good governance processes 
including transparency, accountability and participatory decision 
making” in Chennai, since 1985. Their focus areas are, electricity 
governance,  environment  and  climate  change,  water,  sanitation 
and  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  sustainable  transport, 
informal settlements, consumer protection, and city governance. 
Some of their early achievements include, cleaning the Adyar river 
in 1988; creating a Joint Action Forum for Safety on Roads in 1989; 
and stopping development of the East Coast Road as it involved 
cutting trees in 1993. While, more recently, they have (among other 
things),  conducted  public  campaigns  to  urge  vehicle  owners  to 
check emissions; conducted environmental impact assessments of 
thermal power plants; developed draft rules to curb promotional 
practices of pharma companies under the Drugs and Cosmetics 
Act and launched a ‘right to the city’ movement. Further, in May 
2019,  CAG  conducted  a  wide  spread  door-to-door  campaign  in 
three areas of the city –Adyar, Anna Nagar and Royapuram– to 
convince to residents to segregate their waste, in association with 
GCC.

CHENNAI ASPIRATION: Chennai 
Against Plastics Website (CAPS)

The  CAPS  website  was  launched  in 
January  2019  to  create  awareness 
about the impact of unsustainable solid 
waste management practices and how 
citizens can do their bit to contribute 
to a greener future. However, thus far, 
it  has  generated  little  interest  among 
city  residents,  as  it  lacks  information  on 
ongoing efforts and how citizens can reduce 
their  solid  waste  footprint.  Therefore,  CityWorks  (Resilient 
Chennai’s  implementation  partners)  will  collaborate  with  the 
founders of CAPS to strengthen the existing website. It will do so 
by not only bridging the gap between citizens who want to make a 
change in SWM but lack the the knowledge or know-how to do so, 
but also help citizens realize that resources and knowledge base 
already exist in the city, and that with the help of these resources, 
small  steps  can  be  easily  taken  to  address  the  challenge.  This 
project will be facilitated by Resilient Chennai, and is likely to 
begin soon.

RESILIENCE PILLAR 5:
CHENNAI’S VULNERABLE 
COMMUNITIES

While  vulnerable  communities  in  Chennai  represent  a 
range  of  different  groups  defined  by  factors  including 
economic  condition,  age,  gender,  physical  ability  and 
profession, the most visible among them are the poor 
who  live  in  informal  settlements.  These  settlements 
are often situated along city waterways, and they often 
have limited access to basic amenities. Almost 30% of 
Chennai  residents  live  in  such  settlements141.  While  a 
large  part  of  this  population  contributes  significantly 
to  the  city's  economy,  it  remains  vulnerable  as  a 
result  of  tenure  insecurity,  susceptibility  to  eviction, 
poor 
facilities,  sub-standard,  often 
unhealthy,  living  conditions  and  stigmatization.  While 
local bodies hesitate to invest in infrastructure such as 
drinking  water,  sewage  or  even  roads  within  informal 
settlements, residents are themselves also reluctant to 
invest in home improvements, for fear of being evicted 
and  losing  the  investment.  Furthermore,  a  Chennai 
vision  to  transform  into  a  slum-free  city  has  devolved 
into a program that predominantly involves formalising 
city  housing  through  large-scale,  often  involuntary,

relocation  of  slum-dwellers  or  other  vulnerable 
residents  to  resettlement  colonies  which  themselves 
are mostly located in ecologically fragile lands outside 
or on the peripheries of the city. 

That  said,  the  Tamil  Nadu  government  appears  to 
increasingly recognize the problems with this approach 
and  has  demonstrated  a  willingness  to  learn  from 
past  and  present  experiences  and  from  local  and 
international examples.

2. Contemporary  international  guidelines  for  a  more

MISSION 5: Valuing the city’s vulnerable

Chennai must value its vulnerable communities by planning and managing the city in a way that specifically addresses their 
needs  and  concerns.  This  includes  all  vulnerable  populations,  including  those  defined  in  terms  of  their  socio-economic 
attributes and those defined by other attributes including age, gender, profession or physical ability. This will be crucial for 
building resilience equitably. Three specific goals will help achieve this mission:

1.

3.

Bringing  diverse  vulnerable  communities  into  mainstream  policy  making  by  identifying  the  different  groups  and  their
needs.
Ensuring the integration of vulnerable groups into the urban fabric, while meeting basic needs for adequate housing.
Ensuring a more humane process of proximate resettlement of informal settlers when no other option exists.

LINKS TO INTERNATIONAL POLICIES/ GOALS

Chennai  city  survives  and  thrives  on  informal  and  cheap  labour 
of  working-class  populations  across  sectors.  Much  of  these 
populations live in slums within and outside the city where they 
face  a  range  of  challenges  from  tenure  security  to  accessing 
affordable  and  quality  housing,  education,  drinking  water, 
sanitation,  health  care,  and  so  on.  This  makes  the  residents 
vulnerable to shocks and stresses. Investments have been made 
and  are  ongoing  in  recognising  and  addressing  the  problems 
of  residents  living  in  informal  settlements.  However,  they  don’t 
consider the needs of other segments of vulnerable populations 
who face similar problems and who remain largely invisible in the 
policy-making process. These other population segments can be 
categorised  in  terms  of  age,  gender,  disability,  sex,  occupation, 
caste,  etc.,  and  include  pavement  dwellers,  migrant  workers, 
sub-sections of destitute groups (such as abandoned elderly, the 
mentally ill, sexual minorities, etc.) and people who are vulnerable 
as a result of their occupations (for instance manual scavengers, 
graveyard  workers,  small  business  owners  etc.).  The  primary 
reason  these  groups  are  currently  invisible  is  because  there  is 
a  lack  of  comprehensive  and  disaggregated  data  about  them. 
Government documents such as the ‘TN Vision 2023’ already call 
for  recognizing  vulnerable  communities  in  housing  and  shelter 
policies142. This goal will help set that vision into motion; it will work 
to reduce inequalities by gathering richer and more nuanced data 
which will aid policy-making around these vulnerable groups.

A resource/research centre can be set up to collect

entire  range  of  vulnerable  populations.  The  centre 
would  create  a  comprehensive  database  around 
vulnerable  populations  including  their  demographic 
details, location, the socio-economic challenges they 
face  and  accessibility  of  basic  services.  This  data 
centre would offer policy recommendations and help 
the  multiple  government  departments  co-ordinate 
and  converge  on  existing  schemes  such  that  they 
address the needs of all vulnerable groups.

on  a  set  of  Standard  Operating  Procedures  
(SOPs)xl.  The  initiative  includes  an  effort  to  maintain 
a  database 
independent 
evaluations  and  special  shelter  homes  for  women, 
the  disabled  and  the  elderly.  Strengthening  the 
programme through the following mechanisms would

LINKS TO INTERNATIONAL POLICIES/ GOALS

Neither  states  nor  markets  have  been  able  to  provide  housing 
at  the  scale  and  adequacy  required  to  accommodate  Chennai 
slum-dwellers  and  homeless  populations.  While  the  number  of 
housing  units  has  increased,  many  of  those  houses  are  merely 
four  walls  and  a  roof,  and  are  often  cut  off  from  employment 
opportunities, health care, schools and other facilities including 
access  to  safe  and  affordable  drinking  water,  sanitation,  energy 
and  security  of  tenure.  Further,  despite  many  state-provided 
incentives and mandatesxli, 143,  private sector participation in the 
affordable  housing  sector  has  been  minimal.  In  light  of  these 
realities, communities should be empowered to meet their own 
housing  needs.  This  means  addressing  structural  challenges 
in  formalising  informal  housing.  It  also  means  diversifying  the 
housing  market  by  thinking  beyond  ownership  models  and 
single-family units to allow for flexibility of location for those who 
cannot afford to buy.

However,  just  bridging  housing  gaps  will  not  be  sufficient 
to  ensuring  better  living  standards  and  improved  resilience 
among  low  income  and  other  vulnerable  communities.  This  is 
primarily  because  resilience  is  rarely  achieved  at  an  individual 
or household level, but rather at the local, social and collective 
scales  of  neighbourhoods.  Building  this  resilience  therefore 
requires  that  vulnerable  communities  be  integrated  into  urban 
fabrics  rather  than  relocated  to  sites  that  are  far-removed  from 
already  established  networks  and  ties.  It  requires  that  in-situ 
redevelopment  be  prioritized  over  resettlement  by  addressing 
problems associated with land availability and ownership within 
the  city,  and  other  challenges  such  as  uneven  development  of 
spaces and lack of direct engagement of residents, settlers and 
owners of informal settlements over time.

xl  These Standard Operating Procedures are a set of instructions on 
how the initiative should be run including instructions on design of the 
shelters.

xli For instance, the new Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules (2019) states that, “in any development proposed, where the Floor Space Index [FSI] area 
(build up area) exceeds 4000 sq.mts either the applicant shall provide housing for lower income groups for an extent of 10 % of Floor Space Index area with dwelling units not 
exceeding 40 sq.mts in carpet area or pay shelter charges as prescribed in the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 35 of 1972). The rate of shelter 
charges payable shall be 1% of the Guide Line Valve [GLV] of the FSI area exceeding 4000 sq.mts”.

Regularisation and in-situ upgradation of  
informally-built housing stock wherever possible

The  affordable  housing  gap  in  Indian  cities  is  not 
so  much  about  a  lack  of  houses  or  widespread 
homelessness  but  rather  about  a  large  volume 
of  self-built  housing  that  falls  short  of  adequacy 
standards. 
In  Chennai,  this  sector  comprises  of 
households, communities, and local contractors that 
have built the largest housing stock in the ‘below INR 
0.4 million’ category144. This category of housing, built 
with  investments  from  communities  themselves,  is 
typically  perfectly  placed—within  the  city  and  with 
the advantage of being suited to resident needs and 
resources,  allowing  for  incremental  expansion  and 
improvements.  Therefore,  wherever  possible,  the 
city  will  consider  regularising  and  upgrading  this 
existing  stock  of  informally  built  housing  (barring 
developments  on  disaster  prone  or  ecologically 
sensitive  areas)  to  bring  the  existing  affordable 
housing  stock  up  to  adequacy  by  providing  legal 
tenure and property titles.

CHENNAI ASPIRATION: 
Resilient Housing & Habitat Development 
for Vulnerable Communities

Nearly 29% of Chennai’s population live in informal settlements 
due to lack of housing and infrastructure. Since a large part of 
these informal settlements are around water bodies, this increases 
the  vulnerability  of  this  population  to  floods.  Currently,  the 
Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) is working towards 
rehabilitating 65,000 families living in informal settlements along 
our waterways. The rehabilitation of at-risk families will be funded 
by the World Bank/ ADB.

The  stated  government  intent  of  achieving  Chennai’s  slum-free 
vision  is  to  prioritise  and  implement  in-situ  upgradation  where 
possible,  or  proximate  resettlement  (within  5km)  in  locations 
where in-situ upgradation is unfeasible. In this effort, challenges 
such  as  shortage  of  land,  finance,  poor  capacity  in  facilitating 
people’s participation, and lack of durable, affordable, resilient 
design need to be overcome.

As  a  follow  up  from  the  Addis  Ababa  workshop  organized  by 
100RC to enhance the dialogue for building a “global network” 
that will address slum upgrading / development, Resilient Chennai, 
in  collaboration  with  TNSCB,  has  decided  to  engage  in  a  pilot 
Resilient Housing & Habitat Development project as a flagship 
initiative of Chennai’s Resilience Strategy.

highlight the importance of an integrated citywide approach that 
puts people at the centre of policies, strategies and projects.

Augmenting land availability for 
affordable housing in the city

79
Flexible tenure security 
arrangements

One  of  the  most  frequently  cited  deterrents  for  not 
relocating slum dwellers within the city is a shortage 
of available land. To address this issue, a systematic 
study  to  identify  and  map  all  vacant  lands—public 
and private, large and small—is crucial. Therefore, an 
effort is needed to first map existing vacant lands (e.g. 
by  using  ISROxlii  satellite  imagery)  and  then  employ 
innovative  measures  to  increase  land  availability  for 
affordable housing. These methods may include:

a.

b.

c.

d.

Integrating land augmentation mechanisms into

use for land acquisition along with other projects
such as roadways expansion, flyover construction
and Chennai Metro;

RESILIENCE CO-BENEFIT

This project showcases how data and technology 
can support governance (Governance 
Ecosystem – Pillar 4). It can also support 
more equitable growth by freeing up land 
for affordable housing projects (Healthy 
Urbanisation – Pillar 1).

Access to basic services within informal settlements 
is  linked  to  tenure  security,  i.e.  there  is  either  no 
access to services in the absence of formal tenure or 
temporary solutions serve the purpose, as arranged 
by  communities  with  the  help  of  ULBs  (e.g.  water 
tanks  supplying  limited  amounts  of  water).  National 
programmes such as the Rajiv Awas Yojana, Jawaharlal 
Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, and National 
Sanitation  Mission  already  seek  to  provide  slum 
dwellers with equitable and universal access to basic 
services, irrespective of the legal status of land they 
are  living  on.  Building  on  these  programmes,  the 
city may first consider trying to offer tenure security 
to  those  not  living  on  ecologically  sensitive  areas, 
through  formal  titles  or  alternative  methods  such 
as  long-term  community  leases  and  no-eviction 
guarantees.  Second,  irrespective  of  tenure  security, 
the city can consider providing basic urban services 
such as water, sanitation and electricity to all informal 
settlement residents.

Community-led planning for 
informal settlements

Planning  for  all  projects  in  and  around  informal 
settlements that affect residents should include their 
voices. Therefore, a participatory and community-led 
planning process needs to be prioritized by means of 
various mechanisms and processes. For instance:

a.

b.

Encouraging  all  consultants  to  partner  with
communities  when  preparing  Detailed  Project
Reports  (DPRs)  for  TNSCB  vulnerable  group
housing  projects.  The  role  of  the  community
here  should  be  of  project  designers  rather  than
subjects;

that  might 

For  projects 
impact  vulnerable
communities and/or informal settlements, public 
planners and consultants should arrange to reach 
out  to  them  where  they  live  and  work.  This  can
be done, for instance, by organising workshops,
conducting  door-to-door  surveys,  and  having
field  workers  meet  them  to  gather  their  inputs
using  online  tools/apps  such  as  the  Vulnerable
Capacity Assessment tool used by Red Cross.

CHENNAI ASPIRATION: 
Chitra Nagar

As part of the ‘Water as Leverage’ project, the team ‘City of 1,000 
tanks’  will  work  to  retrofit  a  low-income  housing  settlement–
Chitra Nagar–located in the heart of the city and on the banks 
of the Adyar River. The team has already actively engaged with 
the  local  community  to  understand  and  incorporate  their  views 
and vision for the proposed project. These interactions highlighted 
water and sanitation issues, unhealthy environment, poor housing 
quality  and  design–which  is  inaccessible  to  pregnant  women, 
disabled  and  elderly–and  flooding  as  major  issues  that  need  to 
be addressed. Therefore, these issues form the core of this team’s 
intervention  in  Chitra  Nagar  and  will  include  the  following 
elements: developing constructed wetlands for sewage treatment 
between blocks; maximising water collection on the roof and water 
storage; setting up a solid waste management centre; providing 
safe sanitation facilities that are accessible to all; strengthening 
the  river  bund  through  natural  means;  and  creating  reforested 
streets to act as water run-off buffers.

A city-wide, slum-free 
Chennai action plan

India’s  Rajiv  Awas  Yojana’s  slum  free  cities  action 
plan,  and  the  more  recent  Housing  for  All  Plan  of 
Action,  highlight  a  need  to  integrate  the  urban  poor 
into  urban  fabric  through  in  situ  upgradation.  In  line 
with these efforts, Chennai may formulate a city-wide 
in-situ  upgradation  plan  that  is  not  project  based 
and  involves  active  engagement  and  partnerships 
between  communities,  NGOs  and  government.  This 
city-wide  upgrading  process  can  make  Chennai 
slum-free  while  also  preventing  the  unsustainable 
rise in property values of upgraded sites, which in turn 
could crowd out vulnerable residents. This could be 
attempted through: 

a.

b.

c.

Integrating  plans  to  upgrade  slums  into  larger
city development plans;

Ensuring community participation in the design,
implementation  and  management  of  housing
upgradation  projects  by  building  city-wide
federations  or  networks  of  CBOs  (e.g.  the  Baan
Mankong initiative in Thailand);

Fostering  partnerships  between  government,
NGOs  and  communities  to 
implement  slum
upgradation  projects  (e.g.  the  Slum  Networking
Project (SNP) implemented in Ahmadabad in the
1990s or the Yerawada scheme in Pune in 2009).

100RC INSPIRATION: 
Medellín, Colombia

Medellín  has  become  internationally  renowned  for  its  Proyecto 
Urbano  Integrado  (PUI)  urban  project  upgrading  model  for 
multiple  reasons.  Moving  away  from  past  policies  focused 
on  clearing  slums,  this  program  focuses  on  addressing  the 
challenges related to the poor, and the informal settlements as an 
interconnected issue of lack of opportunities, infrastructure, crime, 
poverty, lack of social services, etc. Therefore, the PUI is driven 
by the aim to improve the quality of the urban slum environment 
city-wide,  and  to  raise  living  standards  by  integrating  physical 
upgradation  efforts  with  social  and  institutional  programs. 
Through a participatory planning approach, the PUI program in 
Medellín customized urban projects for each of the city’s major 
informal settlement pockets based on their respective challenges 
and assets. Thus, Medellín’s approach to handling its vulnerable 
communities  and  informal  settlements  offer  a  relevant  case  to 
highlight  the  need  for  a  comprehensive  and  participatory  city-
wide approach to slums.

Since  many  of  the  informal  settlements  in  Medellín  are  located 
in  earthquake  prone  hill  sides,  the  city,  in  conjunction  with 
100RC  Platform  Partner  Build  Change,  is  working  towards 
reducing  the  slum  dwellers’  vulnerability  to  earthquakes  and 
landslides by improving building safety through seismic retrofits. 
The  organization  has  also  helped  Medellín  city  to  develop  a 
manual that includes the technical procedures and guidelines for 
retrofitting houses for earthquake resilience throughout Colombia. 
These efforts are expected to lower the risk of economic loss or 
casualties for the city due to seismic events or landslides.

Flexible affordable 
housing policy

Approaches  to  affordable  housing  have  hitherto 
focused  on  ownership  models  and  on  single  family 
units.  However,  urban  housing  needs  are  actually 
far more diverse, often depending on income, family 
size, nature of work, etc. The Tamil Nadu Vision 2023 
document already outlines a vision for housing where 
the single-family unit is not the only form of housing145. 
Keeping  in  line  with  this  vision,  a  flexible  affordable 
housing policy could be formulated. Some elements 
of the policy could include: 

a.

A  range  of  affordable  housing  options  (e.g.
non-family-based  housing  options  like  worker
accommodations,  old  age  homes,  working
women’s hostels, temporary housing);

b. A  rental  option  explicitly  encouraging  publicly-

built rental housing;

c.

assisted by unions;

TN Vision, 2023

LINKS TO INTERNATIONAL POLICIES/ GOALS

Currently,  the  predominant  pattern  in  slum  resettlement  is  that 
residents are moved to mass-scale, high-rise, peripheral, state-
built tenements. Since 2000, over 50,000 households have been 
moved  from  informal  settlements  within  Chennai  city  to  sites 
outside the city, and another 30,000 are likely to also be resettled 
to these sites146. This model of mass, large scale resettlement is 
problematic for a range of reasons including safety, disconnection 
from previous ties, livelihood opportunities, adequate education 
and  health  care,  the 
location  of  the  new  tenements  on 
ecologically  fragile  lands,  and  so  on.  Despite  these  challenges, 
resettlement  of  communities  from  certain  locations  (e.g.  river 
banks) may be required. Therefore, the process of resettlement 
can  be  conducted  in  a  more  humanitarian  way  that  is  sensitive 
to  vulnerable  community  needs  and  challenges.  One  reason 
preventing  this  in  the  past  is  a  lack  of  an  official  Chennai  city 
resettlement policy to govern the process. Therefore, there is a 
need to provide input to develop this much-needed resettlement 
policy and ensure its operation through stringent monitoring and 
evaluation mechanisms.

e. GIZ is currently formulating a State Housing and
Habitat  Policy  which  can  effectively  incorporate
elements  of  a  flexible  affordable  housing  policy
to offer a comprehensive and guiding document
for ensuring adequate housing for all.

The policy would support planning in such 
a way that it meets the needs of vulnerable 
communities while also encouraging a more 
multi-stakeholder driven, participatory urban 
planning process (Healthy Urbanisation - Goal 
1.3).

Resettlement & 
rehabilitation policy

is  not  possible,  and  resettlement 

In situ redevelopment of informal settlements is most 
preferable  for  ensuring  residents’  access  to  urban 
livelihood  opportunities.  However, 
amenities  and 
where  this 
is 
necessary, a detailed set of guidelines and standards 
that  govern  Chennai  city  resettlement  processes 
is  needed  in  order  to  ensure  that  resettlement  has 
minimal  effect  on  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  those 
being resettled. These guidelines can be formulated 
in a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy that aims 
to  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  of  long  distance 
and/or involuntary resettlement. This might include:

a.

b.

c.

d.

e.

f.

g.

Restricting  the  resettlement  radius  to  5km  from
current place of residence;

 Identifying  smaller  tracts  of  land  within  the  city
for resettlement;

 Providing land plots instead of flats, giving people 
the flexibility to construct housing based on their
needs;

international  guidelines  such  as
 Adopting 
Institution  Guidelines
International  Financial 
that  spell  out  mechanisms 
for  providing/
restoring  access  to  transport,  education,  health
care,  livelihood  opportunities  and  other  basic

 Engaging the active and continuous participation
of  resettled  populations  throughout  the  entire
process;

Restoring  ecological  balance,  particularly
along  waterways,  while  ensuring  sensitivity  to
communities living nearby;

 Ensuring  that  resettlement  colonies  are  not

Reviving the Sites & 
Services model

The  Sites  and  Services  model  implemented  under 
MUDP  I  &  II  offered  many  advantages.  For  instance, 
providing beneficiaries with plots of land that they can 
develop according to their needs, providing space to 
set up small businesses and catering to mixed socio-
economic  groups.  The  city  can  consider  reviving 
this  programme  wherever  land  is  available.  Under 
the revived project, the resettlement sites should be 
developed not more than 5 km from the city, and should 
contain  associated  services  such  as  roads,  drainage 
and individual water supply and sewage connections. 
The objective of the model would be to ensure that 
resettled  sites  are  well  integrated  into  the  urban 
fabric and include mixed-class neighbourhoods; have 
access  to  public  transport  systems;  have  a  flexible 
built  form  more  suited  to  the  needs  of  low-income 
households; integrate livelihood activities and spaces 
into  the  residential  neighbourhood  and  allow  for 
strong and self-sustaining resident associations to be 
built.

RESILIENCE CO-BENEFIT

This action encourages a more multi-
stakeholder driven, participatory urban 
planning process (Healthy Urbanisation – Goal 
1.3). It will also help foster an environment 
where government, citizens and private sector 
can co-build the city’s resilience (Governance 
Ecosystem – Goal 4.3).

This effort would be critical to help make 
Chennai a more equitable city (Healthy 
Urbanisation – Pillar 1).

Case-based Resettlement 
Action Plan

TIMEFRAME
Short term

STATUS
New / Proposed

Each informal settlement is different; each is occupied 
by  different  types  of  people,  and  involves  different 
resources  and  challenges.  The  TNSCB  will  work 
closely with each community on a case-by-case basis 
to formulate a case-specific resettlement action plan 
in partnership with the people who will be resettled. 
While  this  action  plan  follows  the  resettlement  and 
rehabitation policy, it will help avoid one-size-fits-all 
solutions,  and  will  offer  targeted  approaches  for  a 
shared plan of action.

RESILIENCE CO-BENEFIT

The advisory body will help make sure that 
due processes around resettlement and 
rehabilitation are followed and implement 
the case specific action plan (Governance 
Ecosystem – Goal 4.2).

To  ensure  that  resettlement  processes  are  on 
track  and  follow  all  policy  guidelines  and  case-
specific  resettlement  action  plans,  an  advisory 
body  can  be  constituted  at  the  outset  for  each 
resettlement  process.  This  advisory  body  can  also 
play a significant role initially in formulating the case-
specific  and  participatory  resettlement  action  plan 
and  then  remain  engaged  throughout  the  entire 
project  cycle  to  monitor  and  evaluate  progress  and 
impacts on the community. Members of this advisory 
body  should  include  a  range  of  experts  across 
government, academia, NGOs and, most importantly, 
representatives from the community to be resettled.  

Recognizing that a participatory or community-driven 
resettlement/upgradation plan can allow vulnerable 
populations  to  influence  the  outcomes  to  better 
match with their concerns related to safety, livelihood 
opportunities, family structure etc, Resilient Chennai 
team is planning to support TNSCB by:

a. Developing 

resilient  housing  and  habitat
blueprints for two select sites for upgradation or
proximate  resettlement  along  the  Cooum  River
in  Chennai  with  inputs  from  the  beneficiaries
through a series of close interactions; and

b.

Helping  form  a  consortium  of  civic  agencies,
community  representatives,  academic  experts,
architects,  and  100RC  platform  experts  to  play
a  monitoring  and  advisory  role  throughout  the
planning and implementation of these two cases. 
This  advisory  body  will  shape  the  plan  and
monitor the entire process to ensure that the key
demands  of  the  beneficiaries  are  met  and  the
process and outcome of the resettlement effort
is more humane.

CHENNAI URBAN HORTICULTURE 
PROGRAMME

Recognizing  the  multi-pronged  benefits  of  urban  agriculture, 
the  city  of  Chennai,  under  GCC’s  leadership,  is  planning  to 
build  rooftop  vegetable  gardens  in  public  schools  and  other 
buildings  across  the  city  with  help  of  Residential  Welfare 
Associations.  Select  schools  in  Chennai  have  already  been 
growing vegetables on their premises to cook food under the 
Mid  Day  (Nutritious)  Meal  Programme.  Scaling  up  this  action 
will enable the city to improve its green cover, better manage 
its water and wet waste by including aspects of recycling water 
and composting, supply local food, raise civic awareness and 
participation,  and  beautify  the  city  at  the  same  time.  Some 
funds  are  likely  to  be  available  for  this  intervention  through 
Chennai Smart City Ltd. (CSCL)’s ‘Model and SMART Corporation 
Schools in Chennai’ project. In order to scale this up to be a city-
wide intervention, additional funds and volunteer support will 
be needed.

This Resilient Chennai strategy document has outlined 
a  range  of  actions  that  can  strengthen  Chennai  city’s 
resilience to cope with the shocks and stresses it faces. 
Several  of  these  interventions  are  already  underway, 
implemented by diverse agencies, but can nonetheless 
be  strengthened  or  scaled  up.  Others  are  newer 
ideas that require detailed planning and resources for 
implementation.

Over  the  next  three  years,  the  Resilient  Chennai  team 
aims to prioritize certain actions partly because of their 
potential impact on city resilience and partly because 
of  ongoing  discussions/traction  amongst  interested 
partners.  These  priority  resilience  actions  are  listed 
in  the  next  few  pages.  By  highlighting  these  actions, 
the  Resilient  Chennai  team,  along  with  the  city,  seeks 
continued  support  from  government,  civic,  academic 
and  industrial  entities  to  translate  these  ideas  into 
reality on the ground.

WATER AS LEVERAGE (WaL) FOR 
RESILIENT CITIES ASIA

Spearheaded  by 
the  Dutch  Special  Envoy  of 
International  Water  Affairs,  Henk  Ovink,  this  initiative 
has brought together a group of international and local 
partners  to  co-design  climate  and  water  sensitive 
solutions  for  Chennai.  Multiple  project  ideas  sited 
across  the  city  have  been  proposed  as  part  of  WaL. 
For  instance,  one  project  aims  to  restore  the  vitality 
of  Mambalam  Canal  and  basin  area  by  introducing 
environmentally sensitive elements—onsite grey water 
treatment and ground water recharge systems; bridges 
over the canal to include solid waste collection points; 
and permeable surfaces and infiltration trenches along 
the  embankments  to  enable  ground  water  recharge. 
Other  project  sites  include  Muttukadu,  Koyambedu, 
Mylapore, and Chitra Nagar. 

Resilient Chennai has facilitated interactions for the two 
involved teams with various government agencies and 
departments. The Chief Engineer (Storm Water Drain, 
Special  Projects  and  Bus  Route  Road  Departments) 
at  the  Greater  Chennai  Corporation  serves  on  the 
Advisory  Board  of  the  Water  as  Leverage  initiative. 
Mr.  Harmander  Singh,  Principal  Secretary,  Municipal 
Administration  and  Water  Supply  Department, 
Government  of  Tamil  Nadu,  has  assigned  the  Tamil 
Nadu  Water  Investment  Company  Ltd.  to  work  with 
the  WaL  teams  to  help  translate    the  inclusive  and 
innovative proposals into bankable and implementable 
projects. 

FMO (Dutch Development Bank) and RVO (Netherlands 
Enterprise  Agency)  have  expressed  an  interest  in 
providing  support  for  the  next  steps  to  bring  these 
into  the  feasibility  and  implementation  phase.  An 
application  for  the  Green  Climate  Fund  is  being 
processed  for  the  Mylapore  project,  while  the  World 
Bank  is  considering  supporting  the  Chitra  Nagar  and 
Mambalam  Canal  projects.  There  are  indications  of 
potential support from other financial institutions and 
multilateral development banks for the other projects 
as well.

THE DATA OBSERVATORY

04

ADVISORY CONSORTIUM FOR CO-BUILDING 
RESILIENT RESETTLEMENT PROCESS/PLAN

A number of agencies, including the National Institute of 
Urban  Affairs  (NIUA),  CSCL,  the  Centre  for  Urbanization, 
Buildings and Environment/Indian Institute of Technology 
Madras  (CUBE/IIT  Madras)  and  MCCI,  are  in  discussion 
to  develop  a  Data  Observatory  to  support  coordinated 
and data-driven decision-making in Chennai. Initially, the 
observatory  will  focus  on  water-related  challenges  and 
collect,  analyse  and  present  relevant  data  to  address 
these  challenges.  Chennai  is  developing  an  Integrated 
Command  and  Control  Centre  (ICCC)  to  help  manage 
the  city’s  traffic  and  disasters.  The  Data  Observatory 
in  Chennai  can  work  in  conjunction  with  the  ICCC  to 
support the city government and stakeholders to identify 
their  decision  needs,  utilize  data  and  improve  service 
provision, alleviate day to day stresses and use real time 
data to manage shocks as they emerge.

Tamil  Nadu  Slum  Clearance  Board  is  seeking  to  form  an 
advisory  body  with  representatives  from  the  community, 
and  local  and  international  experts  for  its  resettlement/in-
situ  slum  redevelopment  efforts  along  Chennai’s  waterways. 
This  resettlement/in-situ  redevelopment  effort  is  likely  to  be 
funded by the World Bank. The plan is to form a consortium of 
partners  with  community  representation  to  ensure  a)  a  blue-
print  for  resilient  homes  that  meet  community  needs  and 
can  better  withstand  future  disasters  is  designed  and  b)  that 
the  whole  process  from  planning  to  implementation  is  well 
monitored with community consultation at every critical phase.

A CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PLAN

06

RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION 
POLICY

Chennai needs a comprehensive action plan or strategy 
to help adapt to climate change. This will make Chennai 
resilient  to  climate  threats  and  hazards  by  reducing 
exposure,  pooling  resources,  transferring  and  sharing 
risks,  increasing  capacity  to  cope  and  by  responding 
effectively to unforeseen events. This Adaptation Plan will 
be based on the Tamil Nadu State Action Plan on Climate 
Change  currently  being  revised  by  the  Government  of 
Tamil Nadu in consultation with GIZ.

Wherever  resettlement 
is  necessary  due  to  ecological 
limitations or other constraints, a detailed set of guidelines and 
standards  that  govern  the  resettlement  process  is  needed  in 
order  to  ensure  that  resettlement  has  minimal  effect  on  the 
lives and livelihoods of those being resettled. These guidelines 
can be formulated in a Resettlement & Rehabilitation Policy for 
the  state  that  aims  to  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  of  long-
distance  and/or  involuntary  resettlement.  The  Housing  and 
Urban Development Department could lead the development 
of this policy.

CAPACITY BUILDING 
OPPORTUNITIES

A  series  of  knowledge  sharing  products  or  learning 
sessions  and  awareness  building  programs  have  been 
prioritized  by  city  stakeholders  during  the  strategy 
development process and listed in this strategy. Resilient 
Chennai  team  intends  to  work  with  relevant  public, 
private,  and  civic  partners  to  develop  these  capacity-
building actions.

outdoor  public  service  announcement  campaign  to 
raise civic awareness on a range of key issues relevant 
to  the  city,  including  water  conservation,  solid  waste 
and road safety. This campaign will involve the design of 
an evocative series of posters which will be circulated in 
social media, and select schools, colleges, and public 
spaces.  Three  among  the  top  creative  agencies  in  the 
city, namely,  Ogilvy, Rubecon and Tinacca are working 
on  these  pro  bono.  Such  efforts  will  support  existing 
Information and Education campaigns by GCC. Scaling 
up this effort could initiate:

building  programmes  to  raise  awareness  and
provide  technical  support  for  planners  and
developers.

Capacity  building  on  water-centric  design:
A  similar  training  programme  that  focuses  on
how  to  design  water-friendly  infrastructure
can be developed by a consortium of experts
from  academic  and  planning  institutions  or
architecture/  urban  design  firms,  to  inform
planners  and  designers  within  government
agencies.  Such  training  will  be  hands-on  and
give  participants  an  opportunity  to  design  or
redesign  existing  neighbourhoods/wards/
public  spaces  in  the  city  based  on  what  they
have  learned  by  keeping  in  mind  existing
constraints.

ROLE OF THE RESILIENT 
CHENNAI OFFICE

The  Resilient  Chennai  Strategy  is  just  the  first  step  towards  the  path  to  build  Chennai’s  inner 
strength. The delivery of the commitments made in this strategy requires undivided attention and 
targeted efforts to identify and mobilize partnerships between government, civic, and corporate 
stakeholders. It requires continuous effort to instill resilience thinking amongst the city’s leading 
agencies across all sectors. 

Thus, a dedicated Resilient Chennai Office (henceforth the Office) will be established to:

foster a deeper understanding and incorporation of resilience in city’s functioning and
facilitate multi-stakeholder collaborations to build Chennai’s resilience.

The Office will specifically contribute towards the following:

FUNDING

WAY FORWARD 

The Office will also, where possible, help seek funding for 
the flagship projects and other priority actions.

The various funding opportunities include partial funding 
by  the  Rockefeller  Foundation  with  other  foundations, 
CSR funding, funding by banks focused on infrastructure 
projects,  and  funding  by  venture  capital  funds  that  have 
start-ups in the areas that the city needs to build resilience 
in.  There  are  examples  of  funding  opportunities  already 
available  to  address  certain  actions.  For  example,  CSCL 
could fund water metering efforts. 

To  fund  the  Resilient  Chennai  Office,  one  key  point 
of 
leverage  will  be  the  projects  that  are  close  to 
implementation  and  already  have  government  support.  
For  example,  GCC  has  indicated  that  they  are  willing  to 
support  the  urban  horticulture  initiative.  The  Office  could 
use this opportunity to demonstrate how small investments 
can unlock larger funding and create a greater impact on 
the ground.

This strategy and its associated projects are an outcome of 
the deep stakeholder engagements the Resilient Chennai 
team has had over the last 22 months. As a next step, the 
Office  will  seek  to  initiate,  implement  and  influence  the 
priority  resilience  actions  identified  in  this  Way  Forward 
section  by  mobilizing  partnerships  between  relevant 
stakeholders.

Based  on  ongoing  conversations  and  emerging 
partnerships, the Office will be strongly supported in these 
efforts  by  government  agencies  like  the  GCC,  CMWSSB, 
Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  CMDA, 
TNSCB, CRRT, and TWIC. In addition, key stakeholders from 
academia, civil society and corporations have also shown 
their  support  and  interest  to  partner  with  the  Resilient 
Chennai  team  and  government  agencies  to  implement 
several of the proposed actions.

This  Office  will  also  tap  into  the  extensive  expertise  and 
knowledge  base  from  other  100RC  network  cities  and 
platform  partners  to  inform,  influence,  and  amplify  the 
impact of the proposed actions on the lives and livelihoods 
of Chennai residents in an inclusive way. It will also leverage 
the  relationships  built  over  the  last  two  years  among 
stakeholder groups to bridge silos, collaborate, converge 
efforts, and to initiate robust and sustainable actions on the 
ground.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

The  list  of  priority  actions  outlined  earlier  has  already 
highlighted  the 
importance  of  training  programmes, 
knowledge  sharing  websites,  and  products  for  building 
capacity within public and private sectors, and civil society. 
This  is  crucial  for  developing  a  thorough  understanding 
of the city’s resilience challenges, their interlinkages and 
possible  ways  of  addressing  them.  Therefore,  building 
capacity will remain a key focus area for the Office. More 
fundamentally,  to  ensure  that  as  a  society  we  recognize 
the value of resilience thinking and resilience building, the 
Office  will  organize  Resilience  Labs  –  that  would  include 
mentoring sessions accompanied with a resilience tour of 
the city.   

As  the  key  facilitating  agency  for  Resilience  building 
efforts  in  Chennai,  the  Office  will  closely  monitor  and 
evaluate  a)  the  progress  of  all  the  projects  implemented 
through  the  Office  and  b)  the  achievements  of  the  Office 
to  translate  the  Chennai  Resilience  Strategy  into  action. 
Before each project begins, the Office, in conjunction with 
the involved partners, will agree to performance measures 
and will monitor and evaluate each project on its impact.  In 
order to monitor its own efficiency, the Office will prepare 
a  quarterly  progress  report  that  will  be  submitted  to 
the  funding  agencies  and  made  available  online  on  the 
Resilient  Chennai  website  for  all  interested  government, 
private, and civic agencies to see.

INSTITUTIONALIZING 
RESILIENCE WORK IN CHENNAI

In order to carry forward the strategy development work and translate ideas into action, the Resilient Chennai team 
has explored various scenarios to continue to work with the Government of Tamil Nadu in an impactful manner.

It is important to identify a central institution where the Resilient Chennai Office can be housed. This institutionalization 
should offer maximum leverage to work with the government departments linked to the key focus areas, namely: 
water systems, disasters, metro governance, civic engagement, vulnerable and low-income populations, healthy 
and planned urbanization.

Following are two feasible options:

1

2

The Resilient Chennai Office could  continue to 
operate out of Greater Chennai Corporation 
with funds from projects that are linked to the 

Resilience Strategy Report. 

Over  the  last  two  years,  Resilient  Chennai  has  built 
relationships with officials within GCC at senior and mid-
levels.  The  team  has  attempted  to  cultivate  Resilience 
Champions within GCC to create this relationship. Other 
organizations  such  as  GIZ,  C40,  ITDP,  and  Chennai 
Smart  City  Ltd.  also  work  within  the  Special  Projects 
Department  at  GCC,  under  the  guidance  of  the  Chief 
Engineer  (Special  Projects,  Storm  Water  Drain,  and 
Bus  Route  Roads).  Therefore,  the  Resilient  Chennai 
Office  could  continue  to  build  on  existing  relationships 
within  GCC,  collaborate  with  the  other  organizations 
in  the  Special  Projects  Department  to  converge 
actions,  and  continue  to  work  with  the  city  to  support 
the  implementation  of  the  projects  by  coordinating 
effectively with the Government of Tamil Nadu. 

Furthermore, citizens engage with GCC on public services 
and issues such as solid waste, roads, pavements, and 
public spaces (parks, beaches). Therefore, it would help 
the Office to continue understanding the priorities of the 
citizens by working within GCC. 

The Resilient Chennai Office could be 
established within CUBE at IIT Madras. 

CUBE  is  a  centre  of  excellence  and  collaboration 
between IIT Madras and the Government of Tamil Nadu. 
The  centre  collectively  leverages  the  strength  of  IIT 
Madras,  an  institute  that  is  deeply  respected  across 
stakeholder  groups,  including  corporates  and  citizens, 
and that of government, which has the ability to plan and 
the power to implement. 

The  Resilient  Chennai  Office  could  thus  be  housed  at 
CUBE,  and  work  closely  with  strategy  partner,  Okapi 
Research  and  Advisory,  as  they  would  bring  a  deep 
understanding  of  the  100RC  strategy  process  and  the 
associated  projects.  With  such  an  arrangement,  the 
Resilient Chennai Office would continue to ensure that the 
projects and recommendations within the strategy align 
better with the policies at the Central and State levels; 
the ability to procure funding for the projects would be 
easier through foundations, corporates and multilateral 
development  banks;  and  the  implementation  of  these 
projects would be seamless.

CALL TO ACTION

Enlightened. Just. Integrated.

Going  forward,  Chennai  city  leaders  and  citizens  will  need  to  continue  to  make  concerted  efforts  to  translate 
the Resilient Chennai vision into action. While this strategy identifies potential leading agencies for each of the 
actions, all interested citizens, community-based organizations, industries and government agencies are invited 
to come forward and take ownership of these resilience actions.

HERE ARE SOME WAYS ONE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING A RESILIENT CHENNAI:

acknowledgments

Two years seem to have gone by in a whisker; the passage of time only marked by the people I have met and places I have been to. 
It has been the most meaningful two years of my life. 

I owe a debt of gratitude to:

Tushar and Ashwin from Dalberg, for having guided a rookie CRO through his first tumultuous 8 months on the job and producing 
a high-quality Preliminary Resilience Assessment.

The  Okapi  team,  Dr.  Parama  Roy  in  particular,  and  Dr.  Ashwin  Mahalingam,  Akshaya,  Krishna  Kumar  and  Ram  for  their 
thoroughness and dedication, their patience and understanding, in producing a Resilient Strategy for Chennai that is perhaps one 
of the most comprehensive in the 100RC world and of which our city can be truly proud.

Mr. Vikram Kapur and Mr. Wilfred Davidar, for mentoring me through the last two years.

Dr.  Jayshree  Vencatesan,  Dr.  Umamaheshwaran,  Dr.  Vishwanathan,  Mr.  Raj  Cherubal,  Mr.  Balchand  Parayath,  Mr.  Arun 
Krishnamoorthy, Dr. Karen Coelho, Ms. Vanessa Peter, Ms. Nundiyny, Ms. Yashaswini, Ms. Kavitha Selvaraj and Ms. Aswathy Dilip 
for providing me with advice and help every time I asked for it.

The entire WaL team, Mr. Henk Ovink and Ms. Sandra Schoof especially, for putting Chennai on the World Water map and deepening 
our stakeholder engagement in the city; for bringing tangible hope that we will be a water surplus city by the year 2030.

Mr. Ashok Natarajan for his friendship and constant guidance on Water as Leverage.

The many senior government officials who have given their time and advice, time and time again – Mr. Harmander Singh, Ms. 
Kakarla Usha, Mr. Phanindra Reddy, Mr. S. Krishnan, Dr. Satyagopal, Dr. Prabhushankar, Mr. Vishnu Venugopal, Dr. Santhosh Babu,  
Ms. U. Manimekelai, Mr. Sivashanmugam.

Commissioner G Prakash, Dr. Karthikeyan (former Commissioner), Mr. Govinda Rao, Mr. Nandakumar, Mr. Shankaravelu and the 
entire GCC team for the tremendous support, advice and direction provided.

The 100RC team, Michael, Lauren, Paul, Katrin, Jeb, Saurabh, Ashley, Sharan and Nini for their unstinting support and help. My 
special gratitude to Amit for his direction and help and being there every step of the way, everyday!

Arjun, for his valued counsel and support, and for holding up the GCC end of the relationship in such an admirable way. 

Sarvesh, Abhinand, Nived, Gabriel, Tejas, Prassanna, Gayatri, Amirtha, Dhruv and Nikhilla for the energy, passion and knowledge 
they brought to our effort.

And last, but not least, my family, for their support and love, particularly Divya, without whose help and energy, I could not have 
made it over the last 24 months.
