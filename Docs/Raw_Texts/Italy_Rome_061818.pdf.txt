PREFACE

In December 2013, Rome was selected as one of the first 32 
cities to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities network. 
100 Resilient Cities - pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation 
(100RC), is dedicated to helping cities around the world 
become more resilient to the physical, social and economic 
challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. This 
is achieved by appointing a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) 
who will lead the city's resilience efforts towards creating 
a Resilience Strategy, and by providing access to solutions, 
service providers, and resources, as well as membership of a 
global network of member cities who can share knowledge 
and learn from each other.
100RC's approach to city resilience is holistic and 
comprehensive, to make it possible for cities to develop their 
own ability to adapt and improve, in anticipation of the ever 
increasing number of shocks and stresses that may occur 
(such as earthquakes, floods, epidemics etc.).
Rome started the strategy development process on 4th of 
December 2013. The first phase of analysis, Phase I, concluded 
with the publication of a “Preliminary Resilience Assessment” 
(PRA) that aimed to understand the current resilience baseline 
of the city, through assessment of the shocks and stresses, 
identification of strengths and weaknesses, and analysis of the 
city's existing actions.
The Strategy was developed by the Administration of Rome, 
100 Resilient Cities and their strategic partners. During the 
process, a number of diverse stakeholders were engaged, both 
within the Administration and externally.
The publication of the Resiliency Strategy marked the 
completion of Phase II of the 100RC program.  The scope 
of this phase was to identify opportunities, priorities and 
initiatives to improve the resilience of the city through a 
consensual, inclusive and shared decision-making process, 
which led to defining the structure of the Resilience Strategy. 
The Strategy comprises 4 pillars, 16 goals and 58 actions, 9 of 
which are priority actions.
This Strategy will be implemented in the next cycle.

VIRGINIA RAGGI,
THE MAYOR OF ROME

Rome is an extraordinary city of history, art and culture. A city that has faced 
many challenges, at times successfully, and at times having to count above 
all on the strength of character of its citizens, who mitigated with a spirit of 
cohesion, the impact of negative changes.                            

A city that I love, and of which I am proud to be Mayor. The programmatic 
choice  of  defining  a  Resiliency  Strategy  confirms  the  intention  of  ensuring 
that Rome is well-structured and strong as it enters the future, helping the city 
overcome challenges without placing the burden squarely on the shoulder of 
citizens.                       

Thanks to the determination of our Councilors, we resumed and completed a 
project in which urban resilience was considered to be essential to the life of a 
city, making Rome more aware of its strengths and weaknesses, transforming 
criticalities into opportunities, and making it possible to define a strategy that 
will benefit all our citizens.                                                                                 

This project, which is based on very clear vision of the city, took into account 
existing plans and strategies and placed at our disposal, as decision-makers, 
tools that helped to identify priorities and ensure measurable actions and a 
more targeted governance action.                                                                                  

The  Resiliency  Strategy  will  help  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  citizens, 
because the city will become stronger, more flexible and inclusive.                              

This project, which is shared with the 100 RC network and a very wide audience 
of stakeholder, has enabled us to introduce an international strategy in line 
with the reality of Rome, convincing us more than ever that we are on the right 
track when we involve all the active forces of the city to design and implement 
medium and long term plans and programs with great transparency.                                 

In  particular  I  wish  to  thank  Rome’s  Chief  Resilient  Officer  (CRO)  -  Franco 
Giampaoletti  for  his  hard  work  and  unfailing  commitment  in  facing  this 
challenge.

FRANCO GIAMPAOLETTI,
CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER

Rome is experiencing a time of great changes. To appreciate the extent of these 
changes, one need only consider the global phenomena of our planet such as 
the changes in the demographic structure, Europe's diminishing geopolitical 
weight,  climate  change,  changes  of  the  redistribution  model  of  economic 
resources and the increasingly complex phenomenon of Immigration.

Added to all these are the specific problems of our city: the fact that it is a 
very large region with complex governance, scarce acceptance of new ways 
of  living  and  working,  difficulty  in  accepting  and  introducing  a  culture  of 
innovation, the enormous differences between one Municipality and another, 
the fact that most Roman citizens prefer to use their own transport.

In  a  perspective  of  Resilience,  these  problems    we  considered  to  be 
opportunities. The opportunity of making Rome become a city where human 
rights  and  welfare  are  values  that  come  first,  where  it  is  easier  to  live  and 
work;  where  tangible  and  intangible  heritage  acquired  in  past  decades  is 
not lost; and where there are strong basic cultural competencies and social 
relationships. 

The first effect of the Resiliency Strategy was to ensure the collaboration of 
and between all the decision-making bodies of the city. For Rome, this was a 
very important first step. 

The pillars and goals identified were the result of true team work and represent 
all  the  aspects  and  expectations  of  the  city.  Once  the  Strategy  has  been 
approved, the first step will be to create a Special Resilience Office, that will 
help to implement the Strategy without losing sight of the initial approach.

Special thanks go to the Mayor Virginia Raggi, for the opportunity afforded to 
Rome and the citizens of Rome.

Thanks also go to the Resilience Team who strongly believed in and defined 
the Strategy.

MICHAEL BERKOWITZ,
PRESIDENT OF 100RC

On behalf of 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation 
(100RC), I wish to congratulate Mayor Ms. Raggi and the eternal City of Rome 
on  the  release  of  its  first  Resilience  Strategy,  which  is  also  the  first  in  the 
history of Italy. It is the result of a great deal of hard work and is an important 
milestone in Rome’s journey along the path of resilience. 
The  city  of  Rome  has  been  in  the  forefront  of  humanity’s  greatest 
transformations and changes. Today the eternal city joins the global resilience 
revolution and embraces the mission of redefining urban governance and how 
city ecosystems deliver for the people in this century. 
Today cities intervene and thrive where national states can no longer reach. 
With this resilience strategy, Rome sends a powerful message to break the 
status  quo  and  start  tackling  its  challenges  in  an  integrated,  holistic  and 
inclusive manner – without leaving anyone behind.
I also wish to thank Deputy Mayor Montuori, Deputy Mayor Montanari, Deputy 
Mayor Bergamo and our Chief Resilience Officer Franco Giampaoletti for their 
leadership, and the determination with which they completed the project.
This  strategy  will  be  the  cornerstone  of  Rome’s  journey  along  the  path  of 
development  and  resilience    in  the  decades  ahead,  as  the  City  becomes  a 
global  influencing  capital  with  an  exceptional  natural  and  historical-cultural 
heritage.  Our  vision  is  of  an  inclusive  city  whose  leadership  is  based  on 
solidarity, that looks into the future while holding both its past and present 
dear,  promoting  environmental  sustainability,  economic  development,  civic 
awareness and wellbeing.  
Through 9 key priority actions – Rome will show the world what integrated 
and inclusive resilience looks like in areas ranging from emergency response, 
urban regeneration and integration of refugees, to mobility and sustainability, 
with  the  Tiber  seen  as  the  city’s  opportunity,  while  tackling  inclusion  and 
diversity through social movements and sport.
The  Resilient  Strategy  of  Rome  proposes  an  ambitious  but  practical 
program.  It  includes  actions  in  which  the  municipality  and  other  partners 
may  achieve  immediate  benefits,  as  well  as  other  longer-term  actions  with 
a  truly  transformative  potential.  While  the  more  ambitious  actions  require 
greater leadership and commitment, their potential is indeed great in terms of 
ensuring that Rome not only survives but thrives amid its challenges.
Although the real work begins now, we are indeed excited to see it unfold and 
look forward to our continuing relationship with Rome as it implements this 
Strategy and continues to embed the principles of urban resilience into the 
fabric of the city – that continues to be a referent for Italy and the world.

INTRODUCTION

The global challenge of urban resilience

In a rapidly changing  world, that is sometimes unpredictable, and 
where the phenomenon of urbanization and the growth of the 
urban population is rising at a constant rate, metropolitan areas will 
undoubtedly be more exposed to different challenges and risks, 
to which an appropriate response must be given. Climate change, 
increase in migration, ageing population, greater tourist pressure, the 
transformation of public management, and social inequality are new 
challenges that Rome – like many other global cities – must be able 
to deal with. 

But what do we mean when we talk about a city? Cities are complex 
systems whose cultural, social and economic wealth is based 
largely on the extensive network of interdependencies between 
people, institutions, stakeholders, infrastructure and ecosystems. 
Complex urban systems may become very vulnerable to shocks 
and stresses if the risks and extent of the consequences are not 
known. It is therefore essential to identify the external factors that 
contribute to the transformation of the environment, just as it is 
important to identify the potential shocks and stresses of the city. 
Thanks to this awareness, a resilient city should introduce initiatives 
and projects which, with the cooperation of different stakeholders, 
enable it to deal with these challenges. In the perspective of urban 
resilience, cities and their metropolitan areas are not static systems. 
Resilience is not just to better the ability of a city to adapt to external 
factors, it is based on the city’s ability to map its weaknesses and 
opportunities, launch innovative actions and radical transformations 
in the governance of urban services, create public policies, plan 
networks and systems for access to natural resources and organize 
the human resources that are indispensable for sustainable 
development. 

The scope of the program is to help a number of cities all over the 
world to become more resilient in the face of rapidly changing 
environmental, climatic, social and economic challenges of the 
21st century. The 100RC program supports the introduction and 
integration of a vision of resilience that includes not only sudden 
events (earthquakes, floods, epidemics, etc.) but also chronic 
events that weaken the fabric a city every day or cyclically (high 
unemployment, inefficient or expensive public transport systems, 
forms of endemic violence or chronic food and water shortages, 
etc.). By mitigating the sudden and chronic events, a city may 
improve its ability to respond effectively and provide better basic 
services to the population.

Resilient Cities

What is resilience?
100RC defines urban resilience as “the capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to 
survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses 
and acute shocks they experience.” 

12 drivers

4 dimensions

City Resilience Framerwork |

Shocks and stresses
Cities are the main centers of economic activities, social connection, 
opportunity and innovation. The ability of a city to function is often 
undermined by acute shock- such as earthquakes, fire, flooding, 
storms and extreme rainfall, terrorism, heat waves etc.- and chronic 
stress - lack of economically accessible housing, poor air quality, a 
high unemployment rate, demographic changes etc. Unexpected 
shock or stress situations that accumulate may lead to social unrest, 
the collapse of infrastructure or even the economic decline of a 
city. Shock and stress situations may however, bring new growth 
opportunities to tackle these new challenges.

Characteristics of resilient systems
Resilient systems possess 7 qualities that enable them to withstand, 
respond to and adapt more readily to shocks and stress by taking 
appropriate or prompt action. A resilient system is: reflective, 
resourceful, inclusive, integrated, robust, redundant, flexible.

Reflective
Using past experiences to inform 
future decisions.

Robust
Well-conceived, constructed 
and managed systems.

Redundant
Spare capacity purposively 
created to accommodate 
disruption.

Flexible
Willingness, ability to adopt 
alternative strategies in 
response to changing 
circumstances.

Resourceful
Recognizing alternative ways 
to use resources.

Inclusive
Wide-ranging consultation 
and sharing in decision-
making processes.

Integrated
Bring together a range of 
distinct systems and 
institutions.

Rome and 100RC

As part of its participation in the 100 Resilient Cities network, Rome 
has promoted the Resilient Rome program in order to develop a 
Resilience Strategy that tackles the challenges the city faces today 
and in the future, with an innovative, comprehensive and inclusive 
approach that involves a large number of stakeholders. 

The extensive and qualified participation of the different 
stakeholders of the city allowed Rome to have its first urban 
Resilience Strategy. The role of the global 100RC network is of 
fundamental importance;  it provided Rome access to organizational 
and financial resources for the development and implementation of 
the Strategy, as well as to the know-how, sharing and cooperation 
opportunities with the other 99 cities in the network. The network 
also provides access to dozens of non-governmental organizations, 
research institutes and enterprises that have for years been engaged 
in the challenges of urban resilience and are today part of the 100 
Resilient Cities.

For Rome, participation in the network also represented the 
opportunity to create strong synergies with other strategic urban 
resilience programs and initiatives currently being implemented, 
such as the SMR-Smart Mature Resilience – financed under the 
Horizon 2020 program, and the RURAL-Resilient Urban Agriculture 
and Landscape under the Urbact European program.

Rome's strategy

The Strategy defines the vision for a Resilient Rome and identifies a series of pillars, 
goals and actions.

In phase 1, the city engaged a large number of entities to identify the shocks and 
stresses and the main strengths and weaknesses of the city. Phase 1 concluded with a 
Preliminary Resilience Assessment that identified the city's main focus areas. 

During the political transition period that has affected the city, a phase has been 
initiated defined as Resilience Liason during which the Working Team, together with 
100RC and the Strategy Partner, who supported the city in the development of the 
Resilience Strategy, continued the analysis of the city's resilience building actions using 
a suite of tailored tools. The results were presented in July 2016 at a workshop held by 
the Departments and Affiliated Companies of Rome.

In September 2017 a new Chief Resilience Officer was appointed, and Phase 2 kicked 
off, concluding with a series of pillars, goals and actions that make up the strategy.

Rome's Resilience Strategy is made up of 4 pillars, 16 goals and 58 actions that were 
mapped against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United 
Nations. A number of priority actions were defined for each pillar; for pillars 1, 3 and 4, 2 
priority actions were defined for each; for pillar 2, 3 were defined. These priority actions 
will be fundamental for the implementation phase of the strategy.

In Phase 1 of the process, as a whole, the city engaged over 2,000 stakeholders in 
surveys, workshops, public events and working groups. The Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment, drawn up at the end of Phase 1, identified 6 Discovery Areas.

After the “Resilience Liaison” Phase, a 1-day inter–agency workshop was held with all 
the Departments of the Rome Administration which reintroduced an environment of 
collaboration and sharing. The potential opportunities were indeed defined, starting 
again from the existing actions and survey areas.

After the establishment of the new City Government in September 2017, Franco 
Giampaoletti was appointed as the new Chief Resilience Officer. This marked the start 
of Phase 2 during which close relationships with the new deputy mayors and their Staff, 
and once again with the Departments of the City of Rome, were created. Interviews 
were carried out to update the opportunities identified, and aligning it with the political 
agenda of the Mayor.

The team once again analysed and prioritised the opportunities using the resilience 
lens prioritisation tool to develop a hierarchy of pillars, goals and actions. The hierarchy 
was defined after holding a special meeting with 100RC, the Strategic Partner, the 
Resilience Team and deputy mayors  involved in the project.

RESILIENT ROME

Is Rome a resilient city?

Since ancient times, Rome’s development has been characterized 
by the morphological structure of its landscape, the geological 
substrate, the volcanic origin of most of the soils and the 
environmental system. The Tiber Valley leads to the sea via a large 
drainage basin that draws in the sea breeze that creates a mild 
climate. 

These characteristics have always influenced Rome’s urban growth, 
and have been key to a variety of  transformations, even when they 
are not directly linked to the environment; from the beginning of the 
modern era, to relationships between political power, patronage, 
architecture and the development of the visual arts. This growth has 
maintained a balance between the urban and natural landscapes 
which is unique in Europe. This balanced growth has been studied 
extensively over the centuries, becoming a point of reference to 
develop many European capitals. In particular, the relationship with 
the river is one of the more complex aspects of the city, until the 
creation of the great walls in the late nineteenth century.

Is Rome a resilient city? Rome, like other cities, has, in its time, 
needed to reconcile the need to live whilst also allowing its spaces 
to exist within the morphology and characteristics of the land and 
natural resources. There hasn’t always been a good balance between 
these demands, above all in the last century. The rapid changes 
of contemporary society have created new requirements. The city 
now urgently needs to introduce radical changes to meet the need 
for services and resolve problems caused by a growing population, 
new lifestyles and new ways of communicating and dealing with 
problems. These factors demonstrate that one of the characteristics 
specific to Rome is the need to develop policies that address today's 
challenges by taking into account its history as a complex and 
fundamental aspect of the transformations that are required. Today 
Rome intends to introduce all the necessary tools to understand the 
opportunities and resources that are available to better respond to 
shocks and situations of stress that occur in the city. 

The city intends to build its resilience in responding to the economic, 
social and environmental challenges of its time, whilst continuing to 
chart a course that will allow the Capital to be at the same level and 
“working as a system” with all the biggest European capitals and 
metropolises of the 21st century, all whilst respecting Rome’s truly 
unique nature. A uniqueness that must be protected even in the face 
of the challenges that these changes require. Rome is ready.

Urban context

The Metropolitan City of Rome was established in 2015 and its extent corresponds to 
that of the former Rome Province. It is one of 14 metropolitan cities established following 
law no. 56 of 7th April 2014. Today, the Metropolitan City of Rome is the most densely 
populated city in Italy, with approximately 4,357,041 inhabitants.

Rome is, on the other hand, the special territorial authority with special autonomy 
established on 3rd October 2010, and that administers the region of Rome. The boundaries 
consist of the border of Rome's municipality.

The city is divided into 15 administrative areas named Municipal Districts. The 19 Municipal 
Districts were reduced to following the resolution of Rome's Assembly of 11/2013, that 
introduced the re-planning and reorganization of the Municipal Districts to ensure greater 
economic sustainability.

The information gathered on the recent phenomena that 
have affected the City of Rome confirm the intrinsic qualities 
and challenges that the city today and in the future will 
need to resolve. The Preliminary Resilience Assessment was 
fundamentally important to describe the context of the city 
and the perceptions of stakeholders, cross-checking these with 
the drivers of the City Resilience Framework.

The data and the main themes relevant to the city that define 
its resilience profile are described in the following section: 
these give a clear overarching vision of the city today in terms 
of its demographic, social, economic and transport aspects, the 
landscape, historical, cultural and environmental characteristics.

The picture that emerges is that of a complex city: statistics 
show an aging population and an increase in migration; from 
an economic point of view, there are many challenges to 
face, from tourism to culture and craftsmanship; the city's 
infrastructure systems pay the price of being part of an ancient 
structure and often struggle to meet the requirements of the 
population. This applies above all to the mobility and transport 
sector, but also, for example, to waste treatment. Rome’s 
unique value  is its cultural heritage, which is of inestimable 
value, and includes buildings, landscapes and open spaces.

All of these themes face challenges such as environmental

emerged from the stakeholders’ perceptions assessment in 
the participatory process of Phase 1 is the inefficiency and

The results of the assessment are described in the following

Council confirmed the high risk generated 
by heat islands amongst vulnerable groups 
in the population. In Rome the highest risk 
is recorded in the summer months when the 
ground temperatures reaches 31°C.

PEOPLE AT RISK OF FLOODS
More than 250,000 citizens live in areas where 
there is a high risk of flooding, one of the highest 
in Europe. The areas with the highest risk are 
those at the mouth of the River Tiber near the 
historic reclamation area of Ostia and Fiumicino, 
as well as many urban areas like Torrino, 
Statuario, Tor Sapienza and Prima Porta.

DROUGHT

In 2017, Lazio suffered a very serious drought in 
the countryside that caused damages equal to 200 
million Euro, including investments for sowing, extra 
costs for diesel fuel or electricity for irrigation, lost 
direct production of fodder for breeding farms, loss 
of revenue for fruit and vegetable farms and loss of 
production in the wine and oil sectors.

AIR POLLUTION

The spatial distribution of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 
shown on the maps, and which is currently one 
of the most critical pollutants, shows that higher 
levels are in densely urbanized areas, especially the 
Central-Eastern sectors of the city and those close 
to the roadways. 

ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION

Environmental pollution in Rome, other than air 
(soil, subsoil, surficial and groundwater), is similar to 
other big global metropolises. Given the presence 
of more or less extensive industrial plants that may 
have a negative impact on the urban environment, 
there are many cases of illegal dumping of rubbish, 
but also accidental or malicious spilling of pollutants 
that may affect the soil, subsoil, the local aquifers 
and surface water bodies where the main factor of 
environmental pressure are.

the region against geologic 
problems (earthquakes, opening 
of sinkholes, subsoil pollution, 
geological instability) and predicting 
and mitigating the impacts of 
climate change (heat islands, 
drought, floods, landslide, etc.).

INTEGRATED GOVERNANCE

Supporting efficient and 
effective governance of 
the city by encouraging 
better communications and 
transparent information as 
a result of the use of digital 
media and overcoming the 
limits caused by slow red 
tape procedures.

THE QUALITY OF LIFE

Encouraging well-being 
and the quality of urban life 
of citizens: from access to 
housing to the efficiency 
of public transport; 
from cultural projects to 
improving differentiation 
and recycling of post-
consumption materials.

MAINTENANCE OF THE City'S 
HERITAGE

Protection, preservation and 
valorization of the ecological, 
cultural and landscape heritage 
of the city, by encouraging 
sustainable tourism, and urban 
regeneration processes.

The  long-term  goal  is  to  achieve  a  Single  Operations  Center  that  permanently  brings  together  all  the 
stakeholders  of  the  City  Government  (representatives  of  different  Departments,  agencies  and  service 
companies). The system includes the creation of a powerful technological infrastructure to manage and 
integrate all the data and information of traffic, mobility, transport, weather and supervision cameras in 
real  time.  The  first  step  to  complete  this  action  will  be  the  implementation  of  an  integrated  risks  and 
emergencies management system. This will include a centralized territorial information technology system 
for  management  of  risks  (earthquake  risks,  hydrological  instability,  gravitational  instability,  fire,  extreme 
climatic events etc.) and emergencies monitored by Rome Civil Protection. The system willl also include 
the  coordination  of  the  operational  procedures  of  planning,  prevention,  intervention  and  interactive 
communications with citizens. 

Department in Charge: Head Office
Partner: Civil protection, Local Police, Departments of Rome, Agencies
Investee companies, External entities
Status: To date a number of meetings have been held with the Civil Protection in order to assess and define the 
scope of the Central Office. It is now necessary to establish a work group to develop an initial feasibility study in 
order to assess the project from a regulatory, administrative and economic point of view.
Period: Long-term
The Value of Resilience:
•  Simplifies the integrated management of events in ordinary and emergency situations 
•  Ensures real-time interaction between the stakeholders involved in the management of the city services 
•  Ensures integrated monitoring of city life variables (mobility, networks, services, security, major events and natural 

disasters) 

•  Ensures that solutions are resolved rapidly, and helps the decision-making process
•  Ensures interactive communications with citizens through big data and social media

FOCUS

Centro de Operações
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The  Rio  de  Janeiro  operations  center  was  opened  in  December  2010,  incorporating  the  permanent 
Office of Sustainability and Resilience and integrating the data and monitoring of about 30 municipal 
and State agencies and related utilities. The Center optimizes the functioning of the city, above all in the 
case of large-scale events, and responds promptly to emergencies. The creation of the Center formalized 
the office of the Chief Resilient Officer (CRO), also known as Resilient Rio, allocating a key role to the 
office of the CRO in the governance of the city and opening the doors to resilience as a priority and 
trans-departmental matter. With over 400 employees, the Center is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
and works to improve the efficiency, safety and effectiveness of the competent agencies. Although the 
Center primarily monitors emergencies, it also works on inter-departmental  projects and has specific 
expertise on waste disposal, water, sewage, energy, urban planning, public works, lighting, etc.

The  Resilience  Office  will  be  formally  established  and  institutionalized  for  the  implementation  of  this 
strategy. The Office, together with the stakeholders, will undertake the following: ensure the feasibility of 
the actions, monitor the implementation of the strategy, encourage a culture of resilience within citizens, 
schools and the administration of Rome, encourage the creation of a netwrok of people and stakeholders 
active in the field of urban resilience, and identify European funding to expand the resilience agenda.

Department in Charge: Head Office
Partner: Different Departments and stakeholders to identify
Status: Currently in progress: once the members have been identified, the Office will be formalized following a 
managerial decision; the persons in charge are currently trying to find suitable premises.
Period: Short-term
The Value of Resilience:
•  Facilitates coordination and sharing of resilient actions with the Offices 
•  Creates the conditions to apply the principles of resilience to change processes of the city
•  Encourages a collective awareness of the uncertainties and problems the city experiences and how to resolve 

them

•  Ensures information on the problems of the city
•  Encourages a changing vision that attempts to find innovative solutions to respond to changes

FOCUS

Resilience Agency
Mexico City, Mexico

In  September  2017,  one  year  after  the  publication  of  the  Resilience  Strategy,  Miguel  Ángel  Mancera, 
Mexico  City's  Mayor,  announced  the  creation  of  a  permanent  office:  CDMX  -  or  Ciudad  de  Mexico 
-    Resilience  Office”;  a  decentralized    agency  of  the  local  Office  of  the  Department  of  Environment 
(SEDEMA). The Agency, which is the first of its kind in Mexico, but that has already been established 
in other cities such as Barcelona, New York and New Orleans, aims at working in a holistic and flexible 
manner on different levels of governance (city, region, state), involving public and private stakeholders, 
the scientific community and the civil society. In particular, the Agency will be responsible for liaison, 
verification, analysis and supervision of programs and projects that address the question of resilience, 
with the support of other agencies, institutions, associations and organizations; it will also co-design a 
system that may facilitate the transmission of information to promote continuous learning and innovation.

55

GOAL A:

Make the administration of the 
city more efficient, transparent 
and participatory; and ensure the 
monitoring of procedures

In the first phase of analysis, one of the stresses identified is 
fragmented and slow bureaucracy. 

In order to ensure that this weakness does not affect the lives of 
citizens, companies and operators, including foreigners, it is important 
to act on the structure and procedures of the administration, by 
undertaking the following:

•  working on the mechanisms that regulate the formation of the 
annual program and budget will ensure consistency between 
project costs and funding for project implementation; 

• 

intervening on the municipal “Macrostructure” will help to 
streamline workflows and improve communications between 
Offices; 

•  creating a one-stop information desk for citizens and businesses 

will help relations and increase the levels of transparency; 

• 

focusing more on tenders will protect the whole Public 
Administration system from situations of illegality and corruption.

I.A.1. Link the budget commitments to the three-year annual programming of 
the Departments' activities

Introduce measures to organize the 
programming department institutions 
(Documento Unico di Programmazione, 
Single Programming Document, DUP) and, 
therefore, the allocation of funds. Programming 
is intended as the drawing up of three-year 
and annual expenditure and design plans in 
order to guarantee the funding and completion 
of projects, while ensuring that these are no 
emergency projects as currently occurs in 
most cases.

the Public Administration with the help of new technologies

Create a unique communications interface 
between citizens and the Public Administration 
with the help of new technologies. The New 
Rome Portal will become the reference 
interface for citizens, city users and tourists, 
ensuring immediate and easier access to 
online services. An online URP service will 
be provided integrated with the existing 
call-center (060606). The Unique Reporting 
System will trace all the reports made by 
citizens, in a single environment, ensuring 
the visibility of the progress status to resolve 
them. In the near future, the Digital Home 
for the citizen will finally offer a personal 
environment in which a citizen may easily find, 
with their profile, the most useful services, data 
concerning the same and the status of all the 
paperwork relevant to procedures.

offices . It will also bring forward the national 
objectives as far as possible in terms of the 
obligations to introduce such guidelines, 
through training courses and pilot projects, 
in order to reduce costs and lead times for 
works and maintenance. It also promotes 
the distribution and the application of the

Another objective with the scope to respond to the critical issues of 
fragmented bureaucracy, is the possibility of centralizing projects, 
procedures, approvals, outputs and controls on a single authority that 
coordinates and manages all the necessary skills. 

It is therefore a question of reorganizing some of the Municipal Offices 
to bring together specific expertise, that are currently fragmented 
across different Departments, by creating single higher-level Offices.

It will be fundamental to create a more fluid communication between 
Offices and Departments at different levels and also entities or 
institutions (Region, Government); to promote integrated and long-
term planning by sharing data in the different Municipal Departments; 
effective and transversal sharing of knowledge based on reliable 
information; and systematic monitoring and analysis of data to 
implement and upgrade the town planning strategy.

I.B.1. Complete the implementation of the ‘Rome’ laws required to ensure 
greater governance autonomy of the region (e.g. archaeological parks, rivers, 
etc.) 

The action will increase the governance 
capacity of various aspects of the city that are 
currently characterized by high administrative 
fragmentation (Legislative Decree no. 156 of 
2010 on the provisional Rome law, was the 
first measure to be issued to implement the 
delegation set forth by article  24 of Law no. 
42 of 2009 on fiscal federalism; to complete 
the law of the new local authority, legislative 
decree no. 61 of 2012 was issued).

the Administration transmit data related 
to town planning, heritage, mobility and 
road maintenance, the environment, green 
areas, tourism, commerce, sports, etc. The 
cornerstone of the NMI is its database that was 
designed, to be: 

•  unique, so that information is no longer 

redundant between the different 
Departments and it is therefore easier to 
maintain a status that is consistent as a 
whole; 

•  continuously updated, in order to ensure 

that the consultation and processing of 
data is as close as possible to reality, at all 
times; 

• 

shared, to ensure the greatest possible 
dissemination of knowledge within the 
Administration and the social-economic 
fabric of the city.

coordination. These include, management of 
geological and hydraulic instability, planning, 
management, and mitigation of risks, 
administrative management of contaminated

GOAL C:

Implement the Smart City plans

In order to make use of innovative solutions that address key issues 
such as the quality of life, sustainable development, social inclusion, 
eco-sustainable mobility and energy, etc., a Smart City project will be 
developed, with the main goal of building a route to a Smart City that 
is able to interpret technological innovation and overcome the digital 
divide of its citizens.

A number of new technological interventions are accordingly being 
planned - such as the creation of a platform containing open data 
accessible to all, free Wifi in public areas, the creation of squares of 
innovation and new public access points throughout the region - in 
order to support the transformation of spaces and times, enhance 
social networks and assets and developing social capital by providing 
elements for better usability of mobility systems, security, services and 
the environment.

I.C.1. Introduce guidelines for updating the Open Data platform

The activities include: defining the Technical 
and Operational Guidelines for the Production, 
the Compilation and Characterization of 
Metadata and the Publication of Open Data 
of Rome; the organization and creation of 
a support network, in the Administration of 
Rome, for the collection of data in open format; 
conducting an investigation on the most 
interesting data held by the Administration, not 
subject to special limitations for publication; 
the use of machine-readable file formats 
and open standards for structuring and the 
compilation and characterization of meta-
data for data and datasets; and the creation 
of an Open Data publishing platform. Open 
data may in this way be freely used, reused 
and redistributed by anyone, subject only to 
allocation and sharing in the same way without 
restrictions tied to reuse thereof (commercial 
or otherwise), pursuant to license CC-BY 4.0.

It has always been very difficult for Rome to protect the precarious equilibrium of the Tiber River. Despite 
the fact that the alluvial areas of the river continue to have many different types of fauna and flora, the 
River Tiber is almost completely divorced from the lives of the citizens of Rome who only become aware of 
the Tiber in times of flooding. The Tiber however involves many different aspects such as the environment, 
cultural  events,  transport,  urban  planning  and  sports.  Finally,  the  current  urban  regeneration  processes 
are now considering the importance of a direct relationship between the river and the city. The project to 
relaunch the river is an extremely complex one in terms of administration and maintenance. On 30/10/2017, 
the current Administration of Rome established the Special Office for the Tiber (Ufficio Speciale Tevere, 
UST) with the aim to improve the historic and environmental aspects of the urban section of the River, as 
well to protect the water and shores through a maintenance program and innovative monitoring tools. The 
Special Office for the Tiber helps to simplify the technical and administrative formalities involving the River 
Tiber  and  its  tributaries,  and  ensures  that  planners  and  stakeholders  who  perform  works  in  the  alluvial 
area  receive  prompt  feedback  from  the  Public  Administration,  while  encouraging  the  collaboration  of 
citizens in design and planning activities. UST projects involve all the City Council Offices and the relevant 
Departments. One of the first achievements of the Office was the planning project for the redevelopment 
of a number of parks along the banks of the River Tiber, and intensive monitoring of river and alluvial areas 
as a result of the planning and introduction of innovative systems. The link between the UST, the Local 
Police and the Civil Protection is important and ensured greater supervision of degraded areas and the 
introduction of urgent safety measures. One of the key outcomes is the creation of permanent working 
groups  promoted  by  the  UST  whose  members  include  Lazio  region,  the  Basin  Authority  of  the  Central 
Apennine Hydrographic District, Rome Harbour Office, Civitavecchia Fiumicino and Gaeta Port Authority 
and the Tiber, and Agro Romano Reclamation Consortium.

Proyecto Integral Río 
Mapocho
Santiago del Chile, Chile

River Mapocho is a fundamental resource for Santiago: it is the main axis of the city and passes through 
16  Districts  characterized  by  diverse  urban  typologies.  After  a  period  of  gradual  abandonment  and 
decay, the River became nothing more than a disfiguring scar running through the city; then in 2010, 
the  importance  of  the  River  was  reconsidered  and  informal  events  and  initiatives  were  organized  to 
encourage a process of regeneration. Despite widespread consensus, however, the “Proyecto Integral 
Río Mapocho” was not officially funded until June 2017, when the Region approved a funding of about 
10  million  US  dollars.  The  project  had  also  been  included  in  the  City's  Resilience  Strategy,  published 
in  March  2017,  as  a  priority  initiative  under  the  pillar  “Social  Equity”',  whose  scope  was  to  develop  a 
City capable of reducing social differentiation and fragmentation of the region through equal benefits 
and opportunities for all its citizens. In this new perspective, the River once again became a dynamic 
public space. Some of the main projects included: the creation of a 42 km cycling and running tracks, 
environmental reclamation, and restoration of the River banks in order to create new high-quality public 
spaces.

This plan ensures the introduction of resilience measures at different scales, through the implementation 
of public space improvements, and sustainable mobility to curb the socio-economic and environmental 
impacts for the entire region.

The district, which has an important university, abandoned areas and buildings, will be redeveloped with the 
construction of a new road system and a transport interchange at the Marconi Metro B stop, reconnecting 
of the urban fabric with the River, as well as the restoration of the abandoned heritage focusing on urban 
quality, to respond to the increase in population. Planning of the land and public spaces that connect the 
different projects may be an opportunity for resilience.

Resilience Dividend                   
Valuation Model
Case Studies: Nepal, Pakistan,

In  collaboration  with  the  Rockefeller  Foundation,  the  Rand  Corporation  has  developed  a  tool  which 
enables the community and Government not only to understand the intrinsic value of resilience, and 
also to quantify its potential in economic terms. The “Resilience Dividend Valuation Model” indeed allows 
decision makers to evaluate the resilience potential through a scenario based approach, and make the 
community aware of the short and long term economic, social or environmental benefits of investments. 
The tool may be used to compare different potential investments and thus decide the best approach 
to  use  after  examining  the  social  and  financial  co-benefits  of  a  project.  More  specifically,  the  Rand 
Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation have developed a framework, a tool intended as a guideline 
for the analysis and valuation of the value of resilience of policies and projects. The tool has already 
been tested in some specific contexts in order to assess its effectiveness: Oxfam Nepal, Oxfam Pakistan,

The project consists of actions and tools that allow the residents of Rome to freely experience the historical 
and cultural heritage of the City. 

The  first  and  most  important  action  to  allow  Roman  citizens  to  experience  this  incredible  heritage  in  a 
totally new way, is to facilitate and encourage access to the network of the 21 Town Museums of the City. 
Visits to the museums will be encouraged by allowing citizens to buy a Mic Town Museum membership 
card at a symbolic fee of 5 Euros; membership allows unlimited admission to the permanent and temporary 
exhibitions of any Town Museum for 12 months.

The purpose of this initiative is to allow all residents to have equal access to cultural sites,  through faciliating 
museum access to everyone in the city. The project develops further activities that make museums more 
appealing by developing integrated ancillary spaces, services, improving cultural events, and involving the 
stakeholders who organize training for young and very young people. The aim is to reinvent the function of 
the museums and make them dynamic cultural attractions that are key part of the public spaces in the city. 

Another  goal  of  the  project  is  to  expand  the  museums  included  in  the  Project  by  collaborating  with 
Government museums, archaeological parks, the Vatican museums, and others.

GOAL A:

Promote the cultural life 
of the city

Rome experiences stresses that have an impact on the social identity 
of its population including: demographic changes, the impoverishment 
of the population, migratory pressure and the current real estate 
industry situation. These are just some of the factors that are creating 
more and more social inequality and frustration, thereby increasing the 
uncertainty about the future and the fear of diversity.

The city is in danger of losing the heritage and the cultural capital 
it has acquired over the years; to curb this trend it is important to 
develop a city where human rights and welfare are priority values, even 
through cultural policies that rebuild strong social relationships.

It is important to increase cultural experiences and the opportunities 
of consolidation in order to create moments where people share and 
enjoy experiences, imagination, and creativity, throughout the urban 
area, rather than just in the central areas. This can be achieved by 
integrating the historical-archaeological heritage in the daily life of the 
city, with a model that combines social relationships, well-being and 
economic activities and encourages empathy, generosity and respect.

II.A.1. Reorganize the management of the cultural sector 

From a disorderly to an integrated system 
- Council resolution 126/2016 redefines the 
management organization of the cultural 
sector in order to maximize synergies, protect 
and develop the cultural heritage. The new 
service contracts of companies in the sector 
will take into account the decisions of the 
resolution.

The structures, institutions and companies of 
Rome and its affiliated companies, should once 
again become credible partners for everyone: 
each with specific but well coordinated tasks. 
No longer in random order, no longer with 
diverging goals, no longer in competition with 
each other. A system will therefore be adopted 
to ensure cultural growth that collaborates 
with the Italian State and international cultural 
institutions based in Rome.

a structured approached to attract young 
talents in the region. Rome could become a 
leader in the development of educational tools 
and means to promote and support  young 
businesses in the fashion industry, pending new 
connections with the academic world. 

The project is based on the following 
cornerstones:

•  Strengthen and coordinate the training 

projects currently offered by schools and 
universities

•  Create a fashion hub where artisanal 
businesses and laboratories would be 
located

•  Promote the image of Rome as an ideal 

place for the development of fashion-
related creative arts

•  Create synergies with other agencies that 

develop fashion in Italy

• 

Involve historical Roman couturiers in the 
planning of training courses and introduce

GOAL B:

Promote urban 
regeneration

In the last twenty years Rome has undergone significant urban 
transformations that have made some areas of the city difficult to 
use and not sustainable in social, economic and environmental terms. 
The result is a city with countless abandoned buildings, under-utilized 
areas characterized by urban decay that could however represent 
new opportunities. The development of the city today depends on the 
ability to reinvent these spaces by systematizing different interests and 
opportunities, while building and maintaining connections within the 
city as well as dynamic connections with other cities.

Introducing urban regeneration and programs means considering the 
city region with perspective programs that learn from the past and 
look to the future by interpreting the present. It will in this way be 
possible to tackle the housing shortage problem that afflicts the more 
vulnerable social classes; introduce integrated measures for public 
mobility; respond to the strong pressure on the environmental and 
historical-cultural heritage of the city and find solutions to increase the 
appeal of the city in order to attract private investments.

II.B.1. Activate Fabbrica Roma (Rome Factory), a regeneration plan for 
abandoned public buildings 

The scope of the project Fabbrica Roma 
(Rome Factory) is to offer a new vision of 
the city and plan its economic and social 
development in a dimension where the 
focus is on innovation, infrastructure, “zero 
bureaucracy”, exemption from taxes, fighting 
any tendency towards deindustrialization and 
keeping alive the productive fabric, to attract 
companies and talents.

In addition, the real economic recovery plan of 
the city includes actions to identify strategic 
abandoned public areas and buildings close 
to mobility networks, and transform these 
with the help of private investors. The scope 
is to create far-reaching projects that respond

Moreover, given the new types of hostels, 
houses that are rented for limited periods of 
time or the redefined offerings from large 
hotel chains that are now available in big cities, 
Rome will also be in a position to offer places 
where spaces and activities may be shared, 
developing a concept of sharing based on the 
identification of a lifestyle and services offered 
at a fee.

lines, both new and to develop and upgrade 
existing lines, new cable car type connections 
to reach areas of the city using the different 
original heights and destinations.

In addition to the infrastructure, the 
Administration intends to build new bus lanes

GOAL C:

Promote the landscape 
and natural heritage in the  
urban environment

The natural landscape and heritage of Rome has exceptional 
environmental, ecological, historical, cultural and archaeological 
characteristics: this is a heritage of extraordinary value in terms of 
extension, biodiversity and complexity that must be managed with 
particular care and expertise. Its administration is characterized by a 
number of management challenges including lack of transparency, 
coupled with lack of funding and maintenance. This is leading to a 
decrease in usage of these places. 

Rome is currently implementing policies that aim at overcoming these 
problems by enhancing this heritage and making it available to the city. 
This is an essential prerequisite of an important program that aims at 
developing the potential of the region.

II.C.1. Restore and/or reorganize the use of and access to the Roman coast by

reorganization of accessibility and greater 
use of free beaches, greater specialization 
and segmentation of the offer for citizens and 
tourists. 

The PUA is a programming and planning tool

GOAL D:

Encourage the farming 
tradition of the city

Over its 1,285 km2  Rome has large areas that have a strong farming 
tradition and still today produces high quality products. Rome is the 
largest farming “municipality” in Europe. Roman agriculture, which 
comes from centuries and millenia of tradition that up until the 
present has ensured its presence in the ranks of Italian food and wine 
products of excellence, must be protected from the risks that threaten 
the farming industry. Measures can include providing incentives to 
those who work in farming and  resilience can be developed above 
all by raising the awareness and participation of citizens. Rome also 
maintains its status at an international level by having two farming 
estates with huge territories, but that entails an important challenge in 
terms of relaunching and streamlining these estates. This means using 
public funds and public-private partnerships to develop new innovative 
businesses, facilitating the growth of companies and young talents, 
supporting start-ups and opening new businesses by people of all 
ages, encouraging social farming to improve the quality of people's 
lives.

85

II.D.1.Relaunch farming companies managed by Rome

Now that the responsibility for the farming 
companies has passed from Rome to the 
Department of Environmental Protection, 
the management of these companies will 
be reorganized in order to relaunch their 
farming and forestry activities. The main goals 
of the program to relaunch these activities 
include the application of organic farming 
techniques; encouraging social farming; the 
use of the companies as educational farms and 
environmental education centers, as well as 
places of research/incubators for “food waste” 
ideas and creating biomaterials from green 
waste for a new circular-economy.

II.D.3. Increase food forests and urban vegetable gardens

The use of public spaces for growing “food

an economic, social and environmental 
opportunity. By encouraging people to have 
urban gardens, and even “food forests” 
(edible harvests through sustainable and low-
maintenance agroforestry), or to grow fruit 
and vegetables, it is possible to produce fiber 
plants, timber, wood, dye plants, industrial 
timber, and perfumes. These activities also 
result in increased colors, sensory experiences, 
recreation areas, habitat for wildlife, and 
encouraging sustainable environmental 
practices. This represents the redevelopment 
of marginal and residual parts of the city and at 
the same time raises the awareness of citizens 
on environmental matters. A specific regulation 
will be introduced to simplify the process of 
granting green areas owned by Rome for use 
as urban vegetable gardens/gardens, on a 
gratuitous loan for use basis.

GOAL E:
Improve the attractiveness 
and safety of Rome 

Rome is a city of beauty and has one of the greatest historical 
heritage in the world: Rome has an enormous wealth of archaeological 
treasures, numerous villas and historic parks, museums and art 
galleries, and one of the world's most famous historic city centers 
which is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. Rome also 
produces countless products of fine quality; however, with respect to 
other European capitals, Rome is not competitive in terms of tourism 
or investments by private companies.

This situation is due in large part to the city’s poor infrastructure, above 
all the inadequate transport network.

Improving the attraction and competitiveness of Rome means acting 
simultaneously on the bureaucratic systems relating to Rome’s 
infrastructure, beginning with public transport to connect the entire 
municipal area and develop connections with the wider region. The 
road network also needs to be developed to ensure more efficient use 
of public transport and sustainablemobility systems.

Flexible housing solutions should also be found for those who decide 
to stop over in Rome for brief work periods, finding new ways of 
living. The accommodation system needs to have provision and a 
price range suitable for young people and students. In regards to the 
urban landscape, measures should also be introduced to prevent urban 
decline and unauthorized trading.

II.E.1. Create tourist facilities to promote youth and student tourism 

Encourage the opening of hostels and facilities 
to boost cultural and youth tourism throughout 
the city. This will trigger positive changes 
within the city's cultural life, making the 
historical, artistic and environmental heritage 
of the city available to a greater number of 
visitors, developing models of sustainable 
tourism, and making Rome as competitive as 
other European cities.

PUMS outlines a series of areas in which to 
develop and promote slow mobility modes. 
These areas will be connected through a 
pedestrian and cycling network and the public 
transport system; and at least one pedestrian 
area will be constructed for each Municipality. 
These pedestrian areas will become an integral 
element of the character and local identity 
of the Municipal Districts and will facilitate 
elements of inclusion, aggregation, and 
economic development by enhancing key 
characteristics of each neighbourhood.

In compliance with the Fossil Fuel Free Streets

GOAL F:

Ensure the safety of 
the public and private 
heritage sites in the city

Rome has a great number of public spaces and vast real estate 
properties and infrastructure on which routine or additional 
maintenance has not been carried out in recent decades. Policies 
should therefore be introduced to correct these shortcomings, 
ensuring that these properties and infrastructure are brought up to 
standard and may be used in safety to increase the availability of 
spaces at the disposal of the city. Control and monitoring measures 
should accordingly be carried out in all the stages of the works 
process: from planning to construction, above all using preemptive 
control measures that allow early intervention.

public tender sector. In line with a digitalization 
approach, systems to continuously monitor 
infrastructure considered to be critical and/or 
vulnerable should be developed, starting with 
pilot projects.

92

GOAL G:

Prepare the city's 
adaptation to climate 
change

The effects of global climate change are already evident even in the 
area surrounding Rome area where rainfall patterns have changed.  
Whilst the total amount of rain that falls is not that different, very 
heavy rainstorms often occur, during which the rain that falls in just 
a few hours corresponds to the rain that fell in the past over a much 
longer period. This puts considerable strain on the urban fabric of the 
city, where under-sized water drainage systems tend to cause flooding, 
and on the land itself where these unexpected amounts of water cause 
geological instability. 

On the other hand, in summer, more and more often there are severe 
drought conditions, with “heat islands” in the city, especially where 
there is less urban green or when the city is poorly irrigated. With 18 
km of coastline, Rome is also a coastal city, and the effect that rising 
sea levels will have on the city in the coming decades is hard to predict 
at present. Rome should redevelop the water drainage systems in 
urban areas at risk of flooding, in a resilient way. Measures will also 
have to be taken to counter the effects of very high temperatures both 
for the welfare of citizens, and to combat drought that could result in 
water rationing or water supply shutdowns.

As a long-term strategy, it is also important to raise the awareness of 
citizens regarding the effects and problems linked with the impacts of 
climate change in order to encourage them to use water and electrical 
power more carefully.

II.G.1. Create green and blue infrastructure to reduce urban heat islands

Environmental preservation, sustainable 
development and urban resilience are defined 
through the comprehensive planning of 
green and blue infrastructure. Buildings, 
technologies, and practices that use 
natural or artificial systems (green roofs, 
permeable flooring, rain gardens; etc.) will 
be fundamentally important for rain water 
management, and reducing air pollutants and 
mitigating the effects of urban heat islands. 
Green roofs will also be constructed, as part of 
an extensive energy redevelopment project for 
schools. In the same way, starting with schools 
and public structures that have adequate 
space, phyto-treatment or fish farming basins 
may be introduced, in order to reduce the 
heat island effect, recover greywater and slow 
down rainwater run-offs.

with simulations and models to assess the 
effects of climate change, will be extremely 
important. In particular, the creation of a map

islands and hydraulic-geological risks will 
enable implementation appropriate measures 
such as provision of information for citizens, 
and measures to mitigate the effects of these 
risks directly. It is of fundamental importance

sports. This is used to finance specific projects as well as the annual activities of associations, federations 
and sports clubs. The challenge for sport in Rome is to make it accessible to all Roman citizens, in order to 
promote their health, well-being and quality of life.

One of the most successful initiatives introduced is the movable tennis courts project, supported by the 
Italian Tennis Federation and CONI. Given the success of this initiative, Rome intends to extend this practice 
with the collaboration of national and local sports Federations, fit out temporary sports courts in all the 
Municipalities of the city. These movable and touring sports facilities, are easy to transport and assemble in 
areas such as squares, parks or beaches, and represent resilient solutions for urban systems that can adapt

Amman, Jordan

The  Amman  Resilience  Strategy,  published  in  May  2017,  identified  a  identified  a  number  of  actions, 
including 'Support cultural, social and sport-related initiatives in the city'; an action that encourages the 
introduction of a ‘tactical urbanism' approach - a term that indicates a temporary set of transformations 
of the urban environment at a low cost, with the scope is to improve the quality of life and stimulate 
interactions between different communities and social groups. The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) 
as the authority in charge of providing sports, cultural and social services (for example: sports courts, 
parks and public areas, playground, etc.) has therefore focused on the development of a diverse range 
of cultural and sports activities, in order to promote social cohesion, support children and young people, 
and provide training to society as a whole. The action explores the potential of integrating cultural and 
sporting events; for example ‘pop-up' football matches to encourage the integration of young refugees 
and asylum seekers.

The  protection  system  for  asylum  seekers  and  refugees  (SPRAR)  consists  of  the  network  of  local 
authorities that use the national fund for asylum policies and services to create integrated reception and 
accommodation programs. At a local level, using public tenders and third sector organizations, the local 
authorities provide “integrated reception and accommodation” actions including assistance and guidance 
through individual and inclusive programs of socio-economic and residential integration to reduce social 
conflict and develop a sense of belonging to the local community.

For example, the actions carried out by the third sector organizations include psychological counselling, 
cultural/linguistic  mediation  services,  Italian  language  courses,  the  inclusion  of  children  in  schools, 
placement in professional training courses, professional internships, assistance for job placement, guidance 
and assistance for housing, the involvement of the beneficiaries in the activities offered in the area.

Rome  has  a  total  of  3,103  places.  Following  the  changes  introduced  by  the  managing  bodies  and  the 
adaptation  of  some  structures  as  to  31  December  2017,  there  are  now  1,990  slots  in  the  reception  and

to share efficient urban scale practices and tools, to meet the common challenge of migration. Each 
CRO was also accompanied by their municipal citizen migrants' policy official. During the workshop, the 
cities had the opportunity to discuss and share practices, with contributions from the partners of the 
100RC platform - such as the International Rescue Committee, Mastercard and Esri - and other experts 
including representatives of the International Organization for Migration, Welcoming America, Brookings 
Institution, Mercy Corps, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The 
Athens workshop offered a venue for collaboration and reciprocal learning. Athens currently hosts around 
15,000 refugees and asylum-seekers, in a city where residents are faced with a national unemployment 
rate of 27%, 65% amongst young people.

GOAL A:

Promote a hospitable city 
that respects diversity

Rome, like so many other Western cities, has been affected in recent 
years by global phenomena that have a huge impact on social aspects 
of the city: the increase of migration flows from regions for whom the 
city is one of the first European capitals in transit towards Europe;

social-demographic challenges such as an ageing population and 
the difficulties young people face to find work; the economic crisis 
of 2008 not only impoverished the population, but also reduced the 
spending power of the public sector; last but not least, and as also 
occurs in other countries, there is a risk of strong social, political and 
religious conflicts, that may escalate into terrorist attacks. Reception 
and integration measures must be planned and introduced (access to 
housing, training, employment, sport, ...) that do not end merely

with welfare but attempt to ensure that the vulnerable segments of 
the population once again play an active role in society at all levels, 
including asylum seekers and beneficiaries of international protection. 
It will therefore necessary to think in terms of a far-reaching and 
inclusive form of governance that encourages cooperation between 
different stakeholders, by using human capital, encouraging the active 
part of the population and making use of existing associations.

III.A.1.  Implement a program to strengthen and extend the support network for 
vulnerable communities

SASSAT - housing assistance Rome City 
Council Resolution 164/2017. The New Service 
for Assistance and Support to the Temporary 
Housing (SASSAT) for the right to housing of 
persons in conditions of social vulnerability. 
The introduction of the service is tied to the 
implementation of the General Welfare Plan 
as an alternative to the CAATS (Temporary 
Housing Service Centers) and uses the savings 
from the closure of these centers which is 
equal to an amount of 12 million Euro, that 
is already available. In addition to housing 
assistance, supervised training will also be 
provided by SASSAT to help people in these 
segments of the population overcome their 
position of economic and social vulnerability.  
Once the SASSAT has been fully implemented, 
it will be extended to all citizens who do not 
receive other forms of support who live in 
conditions of vulnerability.

population

The substantial changes of the demographic structure, especially 
the gradual ageing of the population, the increase of the foreign 
population, and the changes of social-economic conditions, are placing 
considerable strain on residents, and above all the vulnerable segments

of the population. Human rights and welfare, cultural growth, 
and strong social relations must be the common attributes of the 
population as a whole. Integrated reception and accommodation 
measures will be

guaranteed to unaccompanied children, the poor and immigrants, not 
only to ensure them a living but also to give them opportunities of 
choice and, above all, a life project purpose.

III.B.1. Introduce projects for the inclusion of children in the cultural life of the

with the involvement of other institutional 
stakeholders (Department of Education, Lazio 
and Abruzzo center of Juvenile Justice and 
the five Local Health Authorities of Rome) who 
signed the Program Agreements. In recent

The first  unaccompanied foreign minors 
(MSNA) started to arrive in Rome as from 
the second half of the nineties.  With the 
North Africa Emergency, Rome experienced 
enormous pressure; in 2011 the number of 
new arrivals doubled compared to 2010, 
making it necessary to open numerous new 
reception centers. As from 2013, Emergency 
Reception Centers (CPsA) were introduced, 
whose purpose is to give immediate protection 
to vulnerable people in difficulty, but also 
attempt to efficiently govern the spontaneous 
inflow of unaccompanied foreign minors. 
The CPsA service improved the procedures 
for unaccompanied foreign minors in order 
to better manage this sector, giving these 
children a chance not only to survive, but also 
to an opportunity of growth and integration 
(child-care family homes and foster care). In 
2016, the Emergency Reception system was 
redefined pursuant to Regional Law 41/2003; 
this resulted in the opening of 12 specialized 
centers and the closure of all the so called “low 
threshold” centers. Pursuant to promulgation 
of Law 47/2017 (Zampa Law), a number 
of modifications will be introduced to the 
identification and age verification procedures 
used; these are currently in the planning stage.

Gradual replacement of the public transport fleet in the city to zero-emission vehicles. The scope of this 
action is to reduce air and noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption caused by 
transport and vehicles, by renewing the fleet with environmentally sustainable buses. By 2025, the public 
transport fleet in Rome will include zero emission vehicles; starting from 2025, Rome will purchase only 
zero emission road transport fleets.

This will help improve air quality, making Rome a more sustainable and livable city, and fulfil the commitments 
shared with other cities under the C40 Fossil-Fuel-Free Street Declaration.

C40 Fossil-Fuel-Free
Street Declaration
Paris, London, Los Angeles, 
Copenhagen, Barcelona, 
Milan, etc.

One-third  of  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  cities  of  the  C40  network  is  caused  by  transport 
and traffic; the transport sector is the main source of air pollution, which is responsible for one fourth 
of atmospheric particulate matter at a global level. The congestion of our roads costs to the economy 
on average almost 1% of the GDP. To address the problem, a network of cities, including Paris, London, 
Copenhagen, Barcelona, Milan, Vancouver, Seattle and Cape Town, met to accelerate the goals of the 
Paris climate agreement and the promises made in the context of the C40 Clean Bus Declaration. The 
Mayors  of  the  cities  drew  up  a  concrete  vision  based  on  a  holistic  shared  approach,  to  promote  the 
gradual and total decarbonization of transport. In October 2017, the cities signed the C40 Fossil-Fuel-
Free Street Declaration, pledging to reduce fossil fuel emissions to zero, and moving towards two main 
objectives: 1. purchase only zero-emission buses from 2025; and 2. guarantee that a vast area of the 
city is zero emission by 2030. To attain these objectives, the cities also identified a number of priority 
actions, including the reduction of the number of polluting vehicles and encourage people to walk or use 
a bicycle to get from one place to another.

The first action of the “Plan to reduce and manage post-consumption materials” of Rome is the reduction 
of the total volume of waste produced in the City. The objective of the plan is to reduce waste by 200,000 
tons year by 2021, with respect to the 1 million and 700,000 tons produced in 2016. 

The 12 actions and 5 special projects under the plan include two actions and one special project that are 
considered to be priorities: 1) the “Waters of Rome” action to promote the consumption of bottle free public 
water; 2) the action to promote the consumption of products sold without packaging (bulk or draught); 
3) the special “zero impact markets” project.  The project aims to prevent wasting the unsold food in the 
markets of Rome. Under food regulations to combat waste, the food recovered will be donated to nonprofit 
organizations engaged in social work.

Bigbelly recycling     
program
Atlanta, USA

In November 2017, the Mayor of Atlanta, Kasim Reed, announced the start of the new program Bigbelly 
for waste collection in the city. Like New York, Los Angeles, Dublin and London, Atlanta accepted the 
commitment  to  reduce  waste  by  increasing  the  rate  of  recycling  and  introducing  innovations  to  its 
recycling system. The scope is to transform a fundamental service of the city through the use of new 
smart technologies. The program includes the localization of a number of double containers, for waste 
and recycling, in 160 locations in downtown Atlanta, in the districts of Westside and Little Five Points. 
There  are  several  aims:  keep  the  city  clean,  make  progress  with  the  environmental  goals  and,  more 
generally, support the efforts of the smart cities. The units were purchased by creating a public-private 
partnership with Green City Solutions, an innovative approach to finance local program and initiatives. 
Bigbelly  containers  use  solar  energy  and  have  a  capacity  five  times  greater  than  traditional  waste 
containers. The units are fitted with sensors that communicate with a centralized system and send an 
alert when they are ready for collection and recycling. The works of local artists and messages for the 
community will be displayed on the front of the containers.

GOAL A:

Protect the ecological system 
and restore the value of the water 
resources

The Ecologic Network of Rome guarantees the preservation of 
biodiversity on a metropolitan and urban scale through continuity 
and a connection between green areas in the city and the natural and 
agricultural peri-urban areas.

The city has large public and private tree-covered and green areas, 
numerous parks and nature parks in the urban fabric characterized 
by great biodiversity, making Rome one of the Cities with the largest 
“green” surface area in Europe. 

The existence of these areas, which are of enormous environmental 
value to Rome, is obviously closely linked to the presence of abundant 
local, surface and ground water resources. These resources, in the 
context of strong anthropogenic pressure, require constant supervision 
and monitoring, especially through campaigns to raise citizens’ 
awareness.

IV.A.1. Implement sustainable urban forestry principles to protect biodiversity, 
enhance and protect parks and nature reserves

This action aims at planning redevelopment 
and restoration works through 
environmentally-friendly interventions 
such as better use of areas, urban forestry 
interventions, etc. to protect and enhance the 
natural heritage of the Protected Natural Areas. 
This allows the sustainable future of the region 
we live in, ensuring greater biodiversity and the 
recovery of farming landscape which strongly 
characterizes the Roman countryside. The 
rural environment also offers the community 
important resources and natural services for 
survival, perpetuation  and quality of life. A 
specific regulation for the green areas and 
landscape of the city will also be introduced, 
through which uniform and organic projects 
will be defined in all the public and private 
green areas of the city.

has become very important to protect local 
groundwater resources, from persistent 
anthropogenic pressure and the increasingly 
frequent drought conditions experienced 
during the summer. In order to protect aquifers, 
the current number of monitoring stations will 
be increased and good recharging practices 
will be encouraged by providing incentives for 
improving the infiltration of rainwater into the 
ground; campaigns will also be organized to 
raise the awareness of citizens on the need to 
protect and preserve the land.

GOAL B:

Promote the use of renewable 
energy sources 

Given that the public and private buildings in Rome are, on the whole, 
somewhat dated or were rapidly constructed during the housing boom 
of the 50s, reducing energy loss in buildings and the production of 
renewable energy for the building industry, are challenging objectives 
that Rome can attain. 

The energy efficiency of buildings, both in terms of heat and plant 
dissipation, may be attained with greater effort on the part of the 
Administration to ensure complete monitoring of current situation, 
and a case-by-case analysis of the techniques used in planning. An 
incentive plan will be introduced to improve utilization of densely 
populated areas for the production of photovoltaic and thermal 
energy; the basic strategic planning tool used will be the SECAP 
(Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan). 

In the context of Roman housing a technological solution does exist; 
this is low-Enthalpy Geothermal Energy, which is still not very widely 
used, but no less efficient and interesting than other renewable energy 
sources. Thanks to the geodynamic context of Rome, it is possible 
to provide low cost sustainable air conditioning of homes. This is 
achieved by the introduction of geo-exchange systems that should be 
appropriately designed and installed. Technologies that are not widely 
used, but are still present on the market, such as small scale wind and 
water energy plants, will also be promoted and supported. The latter 
may use the water energy available on the primary (River Tiber and 
River Aniene) and secondary networks. 

In order to complete the above works, it is of fundamental importance 
to ensure and facilitate collaboration between the Administration 
and private sector, and the ESCos (Energy Service Companies). 
Only a strong public-private partnership will successfully attract the 
investments and funds required for the above projects.

sources (Solar photovoltaic energy; Solar 
thermal energy; Mini-hydro energy; Mini/
Micro-Wind Energy; Biomass energy; Low-
Enthalpy Geothermal Energy) will be the basis 
for the introduction of specific actions. Each 
renewable source will have an objective, in 
terms of installed capacity in urban areas, that 
should be achieved by 2030 and, then, by 
2050. These ambitious goals may be achieved 
by simplifying the administrative procedures 
and removing the barriers that still prevent the 
complete development of renewable energy 
sources in urban areas. A further booster 
may be to provide appropriate economic 
incentives based on the national and regional 
tools currently used, above all to test specific 
innovative uses of renewable sources in urban 
areas.

IV.B.2. Introduce incentives to secure the safety and energy efficiency of 
private real estate property

The majority of greenhouse gas emissions and 
urban pollution is produced by the residential 
sector. Redeveloping existing buildings and 
energy installations will have beneficial effects 
both in terms of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions and improving air quality. Priority 
should be given to measures that raise the 
awareness of citizens on the importance of 
using energy in a careful manner and those 
that help citizens to renew energy plants, 
including through economic/fiscal incentives. 
Energy efficiency goes hand in hand with 
securing the safety of housing, and above all in 
the case of domestic power plants, through a 
service that ensures regular maintenance and 
checks. Economic/tax  incentives should be 
based on existing regional and national tools.

introduced. The main tool used to implement 
these measures will be the update to the 
current Housing Regulation of the City that 
will regulate new buildings constructed 
exclusively according to bioclimatic criteria, 
focusing above all on materials and the NZEB 
(Nearly Zero Emission Buildings) concept, and 
providing, in the case of existing buildings, 
strict specifications to ensure energy savings

GOAL C:

Create sustainable mobility and 
introduce solutions to reduce 
pollution and greenhouse gas 
emissions

Rome has a high rate of motorization (840 cars/1000 inhabitants) 
due, in part, to the high number of motor bikes. The use of sustainable 
methods of transport by people tends to be limited (public transport, 
bike, walking). The Urban Plan for Sustainable Mobility (PUMS) 
attempts to address and resolve these problems.

The principles of the PUMS are integration, participation, evaluation, 
monitoring. The PUMS is a revolution, from transport planning to 
sustainable mobility: one of the priorities is the need to assess the 
movement of people and the offer of sustainable transport methods. 

The implementation of the PUMS will in time ensure the provision of 
different transport options and allow citizens reach their destinations; 
it will also improve safety; reduce air and noise pollution, greenhouse 
gas emissions and energy consumption; it will make the transport of 
people and goods more efficient and less expensive and will help to 
increase the attractiveness of the region and the quality of the urban 
environment.

IV.C.1. Develop an efficient and economic transport model for people and 
goods 

Optimize the demand for public transport by 
redefining the Local Public Transport network 
with respect to the origin/destination matrices 
obtained from studies on citizen movements. 
Re-plan the surface lines and reconnection 
of the under-dimensioned parts of the city. 
Improve the inter-district connections and 
those connecting the central areas of the city.

In regards to freight logistics, the PUMS 
(Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan) defines a 
prioritised district mini-hub and metropolitan 
hub network, defining management methods 
to organize and decongest goods flows in the 
city, and involving public transport carriers 
in experimental uses (such as the use of the 
railway-tram network for overnight transport to 
the more central hubs).

electric charging infrastructure. 

Develop electric mobility in the center of 
Rome and the suburbs: this market is open 
to all operators who are prepared to invest in 
the region; a framework of defined  rules to 
protect the service and operators and an app 
that enables all citizens to apply for electric 
charging points in the region. The Rome

The higher the population is in cities, the 
greater the pressure is on mobility, traffic, 
energy requirements for central heating, the 
polluting emissions in the atmosphere, which 
will cause adverse effects on the environment, 
health and well-being of the people. In order to 
improve air quality, in addition to planning new 
medium and long-term strategies and policies, 
new and efficient technologies may be used to 
reduce the dispersion of pollutants in air. One 
of the methodologies tested, that is considered 
to be interesting, is the APA (Abatement of 
Particulate in Air) that abates air pollutants in 
industrial, production and urban environments 
. The APA intervenes downstream from the 
polluting sources and does not create special 
waste. Thanks to integrated chemical-physical-
mechanical processes, APA efficiently reduces 
atmospheric particulate (PM > 0.1 μm), heavy 
metals, aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs), light hydrocarbons (e.g.: methane, 
benzene, etc.) and nitrogen and sulfur oxides 
(NOx, SOx). 

IV.C.4. Develop the pedestrian and cycle network and sharing transport 
schemes 

From a perspective of an integrated system of 
the mobility offer, short trips or those close to 
the destination (last mile), should be carried 
out with what is known as soft mobility, using a 
co-ordinated network for both pedestrian and 
cycling mobility. Incentives will therefore be 
introduced, such as bike-sharing and services 
related to this such as intermodal hubs (starting 
from transport interchanges) to improve access 
to the network, information and assistance to 
users, new sustainable mobility services and 
safety such as electrical charging stations, 
in order to optimize connections between 
districts. The scope is to integrate cycling 
with the community transport (in particular 
the Underground Railway), ensuring a strong 
increase of its modal share in an effort to boost 
all the environmental indicators.

In order to operate in the context of sustainable development as the 
key element for policies relating to the improvement of the quality of 
life, Rome has launched a number of measures to plan and manage the 
urban waste collection service. 

The city as a whole indeed produces approximately 4,600 tonnes of 
waste (2016) a day. Of these, 2,000 tons consist of materials collected 
separately and recycled, while the remaining 2,600 tons are mixed 
waste. To increase the quantity collected separately, Rome has decided 
to adopt the principle of Circular Economy, introducing an operational 
Plan to reduce and manage post-consumer materials. The focus was 
firstly on the concept of material that may be reused several times, 
even for purposes other than the original scope, in order to avoid 
having to scrap the same.

The Circular Economy, indeed, does not speak of “waste” but of 
“post-consumer materials” because the goal is not only to gradually 
reduce the production of waste, but to optimize the use of products, 
extending their useful life and reducing the need for disposal

IV.D.1. Open centers for the direct processing and reuse of post-consumer 
materials

The plan to reduce and manage post-consumer 
materials (PMPC, 2017-2021) includes a number 
of actions to reduce the production of waste 
by 200,000 tons, separate waste collection 
by 70% and the introduction of the “quantity-
based tariff”, towards the goal of Zero 
Waste. Important technological innovations 
for the home waste collection system will 
be developed, and gradually introduced 
throughout the city. Municipal Waste Collection 
Bays will be built and, in specific cases, public 
and private Waste Collection Domus will be 
introduced; these are small separate waste 
collection areas for specific users. A strategic 
point of the PMPC will be opening of centers 
for Creative Reuse (CRiC), where objects will 
be repaired and reused in a perspective of a 
circular economy. 

IV.D.2. Develop sustainable waste plants

The plan to reduce and manage post-consumer 
materials (PMPC, 2017-2021) includes the 
introduction of environmentally-friendly 
disposal and  processing plants. With regards 
to the effective use of food waste, several 
plants will be constructed in appropriate areas 
with a capacity for at least 120,000 tons of 
food waste. 100 micro-composters will be 
installed for community composting. A new 
multi-material sorting system will also be 
installed  (metal and plastic packaging). The 
plant system will be a flexible and innovative 
one, and will be based on plants used to 
recover material and eco-efficient recycling.

126

The role of the stakeholders

In the first phase of the resilience work the involvement of 
stakeholders became very important in terms of developing the 
Preliminary Resilience Assessment and, later, to lay the foundations 
for developing the Resilience Strategy.

The stakeholders who have been asked to collaborate come 
from different fields of city life. They include public and private 
stakeholders from the local or regional Administration. Often NGOs 
or local organizations have been involved (District Associations and 
Committees). 

The strengths and weaknesses of Rome, and the most critical issues 
of the city that need to be addressed through priority actions 
and policies, were discussed with the above associations and 
committees.

In the last phase, numerous meetings were held with Councilors, 
and the Directors of the Departments of Rome, making it possible 
to focus the Strategy on goals and actions that are actually feasible. 
The input from stakeholders it allowed the working groups to:

•  obtain multiple perspectives and approaches, in the analysis 

phase, and in defining the Strategy and vision of the City;

•  help the CRO and the Resilience Team to clearly understand the 

dynamics of the city;

•  plan the Strategy in an inclusive manner;

•  ensure complete transparency when defining the Strategy.

It is hoped that in the future, these same stakeholders will 
contribute, each in their own field of expertise, the implementation 
of the Strategy with the same level of cooperation enjoyed to date.

Citizens and associations will continue to be involved on the 
question of resilience and the projects that Rome intends to pursue, 
through a series of participatory processes.

It will also be important to extend the involvement to other public 
and private Italian and international stakeholders, in order to extend 
the exchange of good practice and increase our knowledge of urban 
resilience.

127

Links with current Plans

Most of the actions described in this Strategy are part of plans and 
programs approved or with pending approval. In order to make 
the Strategy legible, the most important initiatives of each plan or 
program taken into account are described in the following pages.
The fact that the actions of the Strategy are linked to the main 
strategies of the city, reciprocally improves implementation and 
the certainty to deliver the expected results in a structured and 
consistent manner.

The main characteristics and objectives of the plans and programs  
are described below, while the diagram shows the correlations with 
the actions of the Strategy.

DIGITAL AGENDA
The “Digital Agenda of Rome” is used as reference for the action 
regarding the digital transformation of the Administration and 
provision of services to citizens and businesses.

FABBRICA ROMA
(Rome Factory)
The plan aims at introducing a process of involving the social 
workforce to promote sustainable development for the capital, and 
build a participatory vision for the future of the city. Workshops 
with the administration and manufacturing companies will give the 
opportunity of piloting projects, customizing answers, and definitely 
ensuring real support to the growth of the local economy and 
employment.

UTILIZATION PLAN FOR ROME'S COASTLINE
(Utilization Plan for Rome's Coastline - PUA) 
This is the planning and programming tool of State-owned maritime 
areas to regulate their utilization for tourism, in compliance with legal 
requirements and environmental protection. The plan is a summary 
of a far-reaching program of redevelopment of the Roman coastline, 
based on two key concepts: quality and protection.

128

URBAN GREENING PLAN 
The plan incorporates a comprehensive regulation framework for 
all the public and private green areas of the city, to ensure effective 
and sustainable management, increase environmental and landscape 
value, and protect its characteristics. The plan takes into account the 
experiences of previous regulations and the national environmental 
and community regulations currently in force. 

PLAN FOR THE PROMOTION OF SPORT
Sport, as a means of social and cultural integration of the city, is 
promoted by enhancing the public and private systems with social 
principles rather than economic in the allocation of municipal sports 
facilities. In order to promote sports for disadvantaged categories, 
funding is available for projects promoted by private sports clubs; 
in addition, the Sports Citadel, a facility of the Italian Paralympic 
Committee, was also inaugurated.

PLAN FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THE CULTURAL 
SECTOR
(Operative guidelines for the management of the services provided 
by cultural institutions and companies of Rome) 
Council Resolution 126/2016 redefines the management of the 
cultural sector in order to maximize synergies, protect and 
enhance the cultural heritage. It is the reference law, regarding the 
organization of cultural institutions, and will
be implemented gradually, using the new reliance and concession 
criteria.

POST-CONSUMER MATERIALS PLAN (PMPC)
“Plan to reduce and manage the 2017-2021 post-consumer materials 
of Rome (PMPC)” approved with Rome Council Resolution no. 47 of 
30 March 2017.
The plan is based on four important actions: prevention, reuse, 
separation and enhancement of post-consumer materials by 
developing an economy based on eco-efficient recycling and re-
use of materials. By 2021 the PMPC aims at reducing the annual 
production of waste by 200,000 tons, increasing separate waste 
collection from 44% to 70%, constructing new recycling and 
composting plants and creating a new Ama organization based on 
Municipal units. This will place Rome on the path of a zero waste 
circular economy.

129

CITY SOCIAL PLAN
The engagement period to draw up the new Social Plan for citizens 
ended in May 2017. The plan, which should be approved in 2018, 
represents the action plan of the Administration of Rome for 
vulnerable people and covers those topics: poverty, inclusion, Roma 
settlements, educational and school policies, violence, disability, drug 
use, home, serious social exclusion, children, families, seniors. 
The REI (Inclusion Income set forth by Legislative Decree of 
15 September 2017, no. 147, implementing the delegated law to 
combat poverty) will be used for the social inclusion of vulnerable 
communities, rather than the SIA (Support for active inclusion)

URBAN PLAN FOR SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY (PUMS)
The Urban Plan of Sustainable Mobility is a short, medium and long 
term strategic plan , that develops a vision for mobility.
The PUMS addresses the issue of infrastructure for public transport, 
soft mobility, the primary road network and the distribution of 
goods. The PUMS promotes safety, access for all and implements 
technologies to improve “intelligence” between infrastructure, 
vehicles and people.

REGULATION FOR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND 
HANDICRAFTS IN THE HISTORIC CENTER
The Regulation introduces important changes to protect the 
decorum and quality of business in the center which is recognized by 
UNESCO as a World Heritage site, and in particular in the Municipal 
Districts of Rome's historic center, with a more efficient control 
system for the areas of greatest value.
In these areas no new businesses may be opened other than those 
protected, in order to rebalance the goods sectors and prevent real 
estate speculation.

SPECIAL OFFICE FOR THE TIBER
The “Special Office for the Tiber ” was created in accordance with 
the Order of the Mayor no. 173 of 30/10/2017 and has important 
functions such as the historical-environmental enhancement of the 
urban section of the River Tiber, and maintenance, development and 
protection of the waters and banks through innovative monitoring.
The Office is an organizational structure of the Administration whose 
functions are monitoring, control and coordination of the entities 
involved.

130

OSTIENSE MARCONI URBAN PLAN (PUOM)
The scope of the Ostiense Marconi Urban Plan is the requalification 
and development of the urban area as a whole. The plan includes 
the construction of a new road system and transport exchange at 
the Metro B Marconi stop, the reconnection of the urban fabric and 
the relationship with the River, and the restoration of abandoned 
properties. The plan in particular focuses on urban quality and 
green areas to resolve problems caused by population density and 
heat islands, soil and public space design to connect the different 
interventions.

TIBURTINO HUB PROGRAM (PHT)
The scope of the program is the strategic redevelopment of the area 
as a whole,  bringing all the urban transport elements together in a 
hub, so as to rationalize and develop the system and increase the 
innovative aspects. The program also includes a reorganization of 
the functions and infrastructure of the Eastern Directional System 
and Tiburtina Railway Station System Districts, connecting these 
systematically in order to develop the Hub as an axis of development 
for employment, innovation and the transfer of technology, through 
shared processes of urban marketing.

SECAP
Following the resolution of the Rome Assembly no. 78 of 14 
November 2017,  the City of Rome officially agreed at the Covenant 
of Mayors on climate and energy, accepting the ambitious 
commitment of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its region 
by at least 40% by 2030. This commitment consists of adopting 
and implementing the Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan 
(SECAP), that the City of Rome must draw up and approve no later 
than 14 November 2019. The SECAP is an ambitious plan because 
Rome is required to analyze the balance of climate altering emissions 
of the waste sector and green areas, in addition to that of other 
obligatory sectors (mobility, residential, tertiary).
The Rome SEAP will be drawn up taking into account the strategic 
guidelines from the individual sectoral plans (in addition to this 
Strategic Resilience Plan, also the Urban Plan for Sustainable 
Mobility; the plan to reduce and manage post-consumer materials; 
and Smart City guidelines; etc.) that have a single theme in common, 
and will contribute to creating a new vision of Rome as a sustainable, 
resilient and inclusive City. 

C40
Another tool used to combat climate change is the C40 network, 
introduced under the Compact of Mayors, of which Rome is a City 
Member. The network includes more than 90 leading global cities 
that will implement actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
risks related to climate change, while increasing the health, well-
being and economic opportunities for citizens.
In accordance with the commitments accepted under the C40 
network, a Plan for Adaptation to climate change of the city, will 
also be drawn up. The actions of the plan that the City of Rome 
intends to implement in order to make the city more resilient and 
less exposed to the effects of climate change, will be constantly 
monitored and updated.

Links with other European Programs

Rome is one of the few cities that, today, benefits from several 
resources at the same time to support urban resilience, including 
the 100RC initiative and the European project SMR - Smart Mature 
Resilience, under the Horizon 2020 Program (http://smr-project.eu/
home/)1.

The two projects have many points of integration, synergy and 
complement each other in a number of ways: where the SMR 
project contains a highly scientific methodological study with the 
involvement of leading European research institutions, the 100RC 
initiative offers unsurpassed networking and interchange capabilities 
with many cities in the world that represent many different 
challenges of urban resilience.

Today, Resilient Rome is a strong point of the Administration: 
Rome will be a unique case of great importance in the international 
context, in terms of the policies designed to tackle the new 
challenges caused by climate change and social dynamics.

The scope of the SMR is to develop tools that may improve the 
ability of cities to resist, absorb and adapt to the risks to which 
they are exposed to focusing on climate change, infrastructure and 
society. 

There are five tools to improve the resilience in the SMR: 1. The 
Resilience Maturity Model, a methodological approach to define 
the degree of resilience attained by cities, based on objective, 
measurable and comparable parameters; 2. Systemic Risk 
Assessment: a tool for assessing the exposure to different types 
of risks faced by the city. The actual cause-effect relationships 
and interdependence of the different types of risks are examined 
Portfolio of Resilience Building Policies, i.e. a portfolio of policies 
capable of taking the city towards higher levels of resilience; 4. 
System Dynamics Model, a model for assessing and increasing urban 
resilience. This is used as basis to establish an Urban Resilience 
Office; 5. The Resilience Engagement and Communication Tool, i.e. 
a tool to encourage active participation of the local communities in 
the application process of urban resilience policies: it is now crucially 
important to create a permanent interdisciplinary inter-department 
round table to ensure cooperation and community growth to 
manage urban resilience in Rome. This was confirmed quite clearly 
during the local meetings, with the different Departments and 
Offices of the Administration of Rome (Civil Protection, Mobility, 
Infrastructure, Heritage, Environment, Urban Planning, Social 
Policies, Culture), with the private stakeholders and civil society 
involved.

138

The expected final result of the project complies in full with the 
100RC initiative, i.e. that of laying the basis to create a special Urban 
Resilience Office, which coordinates the resilience policies, involving 
all the stakeholders, from European and national institutions to local 
institutions, including the Departments and Offices of Rome, the 
private sector, the Citizen Associations and civil society.

140

Monitoring

The management and monitoring of the implementation process of 
the Resilience Strategy, are closely related. The Resilience Office will 
undoubtedly monitor the implementation of the Strategy through 
the pillars, goals and actions. 

The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations are 
another monitoring process implemented by the City and are 
another tool chosen by Resilience Team to help the Resilience 
Office implement the strategy. Each action of the Strategy is linked 
to one or more of the 17 Goals in order to better understand the 
relationships. 

Finally, the Resilience Office will assess whether it is possible to use 
the City Resilience Index (CRI) to measure its resilience performance. 
The CRI consists of 156 quantitative and qualitative indicators.     

142

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

In September 2015, the Governments of 193 member Countries of the United Nations 
Organization signed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is an action 
program designed for the prosperity of people and the planet. This extensive program also 
includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals - that originate from the results of previous 
MDGs (Millennium Development Goals) and are the common goals of a number of key 
development issues.

146

Next steps

The enthusiasm that all the Departments of Rome and the 
stakeholders have demonstrated in this Resilience Strategy, is all the 
encouragement we need to continue the Project and look forward 
with confidence to the possibility of having a more Resilient City in 
the near future. 

After completing phase one of the project it became quite clear 
that Resilience should be extended to all the areas that affect the 
life of a city and its citizens: from governance to urban regeneration, 
from social policies for culture and adaptation to climate change to 
security, the environment and transport.

Accordingly, in phase two of the project when the Strategy was 
defined, under the coordination of the Councilor for Urban Planning, 
the Director-General of Rome was appointed as the new CRO to 
emphasize the far-reaching nature of Resilience and the need for 
strong and efficient coordination.

Thanks to this new CRO, who was in a neutral position with respect 
to the political and administrative bodies, it was possible to work 
very successfully with all the Regional Council Offices and Municipal 
Departments, to share a Strategy that will certainly have a positive 
impact on the city.

In order to implement the Strategy, a Resilience Office, which 
reports to the Head Office will be created according to the above 
criteria. The Office will work closely with the Steering Committee 
and the Heads of Department of the city of Rome.

The Office will be responsible for: 

•  monitoring and updating the Resilience Strategy;

•  promoting a culture of resilience;

• 

supporting the creation of a network of entities and stakeholders 
who work in the field of resilience to promote good practices;

•  finding public and private funding to implement actions that 

make Rome stronger and more resilient.

Affiliated Companies

The affiliated companies directly or indirectly controlled by Rome 
have been analyzed in the last period to reorganize and simplify 
the structure, reducing the costs of the system. This process was 
completed in March 2017 when the Reorganization Plan, which 
includes a reduction of the number of companies from 31 to 11 by 
2021, was approved. 

Pending the implementation of the plan, and when the  Resiliency 
Strategy report was drawn up, the structure of affiliated companies
