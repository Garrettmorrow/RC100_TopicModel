RESILIENT 
KYOTO

KYOTO 

LETTER FROM 
THE MAYOR

OUR INAUGURAL YEAR OF 
RESILIENCE INCLUDES ALL 
KYOTO’S CITIZENS

Firstly, I would like to thank all the people who have contributed their 
time and input into the development of Kyoto’s Resilience Strategy.

Kyoto city has maintained its unique culture, which attracts people from 
all over the world, since 794 AD. This has not been an easy path, Kyoto 
has faced many natural disasters, disease outbreaks and civil wars. 
Despite these challenges, Kyoto has continued to overcome and thrive 
for over a thousand years.

Daisaku Kadokawa 
Mayor of Kyoto City

One of Kyoto’s biggest challenges presented itself when Kyoto effectively lost its status as the imperial capital in 
1868 which led to a sharp decline in the population and plunged the city into an existential crisis. Kyoto’s leaders 
and people responded to this challenge through innovations in technology and local industry, which laid the 
foundations of Kyoto’s prosperity today. Since this time, Kyoto’s citizens have innately understood that a crisis 
presents the opportunity to rebound and improve through cooperation and leadership.

In this way, Kyoto city, as well as the rest of Japan, has prospered over the last century. However, in this rapidly 
changing domestic and global situation, today’s Kyoto city faces a variety of resilience challenges. These 
challenges include more frequent and intense natural disasters along with a declining and aging population 
resulting in fewer citizens able to support our economy, childcare, and local communities. Now is the time for us 
to embrace and refine the power of the resilience approach to overcome our current challenges and create a new 
future.

Our commitment to a resilience approach has led to the development of The Kyoto Resilience Strategy which 
was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities Initiative (100RC). The concept of Resilience 
resonates with the inclusive and equitable philosophy of “Leave No One Behind”, which is a statement of the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that seek to achieve a sustainable global society by 2030. 
Through improving the City’s resilience, Kyoto’s Resilience Strategy will also be advancing the SDGs. 

Through this strategy and initiative, I believe a more Resilient Kyoto will be passed on to the next generation by 
encouraging and involving everyone who lives in Kyoto, along with the municipality, to voluntarily commit to 
resilience actions. Let’s mark this year as our inaugural year of Resilience and all do our best to make it a success.

RESILIENT KYOTO  |  STRATEGY OVERVIEW

LETTER FROM 
THE PRESIDENT 
OF 100RC

On behalf of 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the Rockefeller 
Foundation, I want to congratulate Mayor Kadokawa, Chief Resilience 
Officer Hiroyuki Fujita, and the City of Kyoto on the release of the city’s 
first Resilience Strategy. 

As an ancient city that has reinvented itself numerous times over the 
last millennium, Kyoto’s past and future are intertwined. This Strategy 
recognizes that Kyoto’s history and heritage are intrinsic to its urban 
fabric and seeks to outline a framework that respects and honors this 
fact while also working to establish a sure footing in the 21st century 
and beyond, with a bright social and economic future. How does an 
ancient city and a modern economy coexist? How can a city modernize 
and build a balanced future, without sacrificing the culture and heritage 
that gives it life? These are the questions Resilient Kyoto sets out to 
resolve. Lessons learned will provide invaluable insight to cities across 
100RC’s global network.

Michael Berkowitz

President 100 
Resilient Cities

In its application to join 100RC, Kyoto highlighted tangible and urgent challenges including an aging population, 
economic vulnerabilities, vulnerability to natural disasters, and a need to protect historical assets while creating 
contemporary opportunities. 

This mix of challenges offered ample and exciting partnership prospects, and we extended an invitation for Kyoto 
to join the 100 Resilient Cities network in 2016. In many ways, Kyoto represents the quintessential Japanese city, 
and presents a prime opportunity to show the world what urban resilience can mean for Japan. 

The work of Kyoto CRO, Hiroyuki Fujita, is a prime example of resilience in context. He has worked painstakingly 
to adapt the resilience process to best suit the city’s cultural context and needs, while at the same time 
introducing new concepts and agitating for the change needed for Kyoto to meet its future
head on.

The historic cities in our network have an innate sense of resilience and Kyoto is no exception. This Strategy 
articulates for the first time how this city will continue to adapt to meet the challenges of the 21st century and 
begins to lay a path for Kyoto’s next thousand years. I thank Mayor Kadokawa and CRO Fujita for their tireless 
efforts in creating this roadmap and igniting a resilience movement in Kyoto. As the city moves to take the 
difficult next steps of putting Resilient Kyoto to action, I invite you all to join that movement and contribute to a 
resilient future.

LETTER FROM 
KYOTO CRO

KEEPING KYOTO AS KYOTO INTO 
THE FUTURE

Hiroyuki Fujita

Chief Resilience Officer

On the occasion of announcing Kyoto’s Resilience Strategy, I find myself 
feeling a combination of fascination and concern as I reflect on how 
the concept of resilience for our city will be passed on over the next 50 
years.

This is not just a strategy, it’s our effort to create a roadmap to a 
future sustainable society. In this effort, our first step is to introduce a 
collaborative approach and mindset to all the work contained in this 
strategy. At the same time, public administrators will have to make a 
commitment to working across departmental silos and preparing for 
our resilience challenges with innovation and flexibility.

These resilience challenges are not only potential future disasters such as natural disasters and terrorist attack, 
but also incremental stresses such as a declining population, low birthrates, as well as the degradation of 
community cohesion and landscapes. A resilience approach is more necessary than ever to enable us to overcome 
these new modern challenges.

Kyoto is already resilient, in the sense that we have functioned as a city for over a thousand years. Our strengths 
are deeply embedded in Kyoto city, they include the spirit of Kyoto’s citizens, our traditional values, our respect 
for nature and our leadership in manufacturing. Our civil life is characterized by these strengths, and by deep 
engagement and collaboration between individuals, communities, and various enabling organizations, including 
universities, businesses, religious institutions and non- profit organizations. 

However, our city’s fundamental resilience will not be passed on if we do not all act in response to the challenges 
that our city faces.

Kyoto’s Resilience Strategy has been completed, but its success will depend on us all, city government, local 
organizations and citizens of all ages, to think and act differently to create a more resilient Kyoto.

I would like to thank 100 Resilient Cities for their generous support, and thank all the people who have contributed 
their time and input into the development of Kyoto’s Resilience Strategy.

OUR VISION 

WE WILL ENTRUST 
AN AUTHENTIC AND 
RESILIENT KYOTO TO 
FUTURE GENERATIONS.

Kyoto is recognized around the world as a city that 
has woven together its living cultural heritage, 
local industries and natural environment to create 
a thriving and growing city with a reputation 
for tolerance that draws visitors, students and 
entrepreneurs from around the world.

To achieve our vision, Kyoto City is proactively 
identifying and addressing multiple challenges, ranging 
from natural disasters to social stresses. This has 
resulted in our Strategy – Resilient Kyoto.

RESILIENT KYOTO  |  STRATEGY OVERVIEW

CONTEXT

Kyoto is an inland city situated in the central part of 
the Japanese archipelago. It is the capital city of Kyoto 
Prefecture, located in the Kansai region of Japan. The 
city is surrounded by mountains and hosts three rivers. 
It has an area of 827.9 kilometers2 (319.7 miles2).

Kyoto city has a population of about 1.48 million people 
(2015 census). Most of the Kyoto’s population is aged 
between 15 and 64 years. Like most Japanese cities, 
Kyoto is home to an aging population due to low birth 
rates. Kyoto is renowned for its traditional crafts and 
industries, there are currently 74 certified traditional 
industries in Kyoto ranging from textiles to sake 
brewing to ceramics. Home to 38 universities and junior 
colleges, Kyoto is also one Japan’s academic centers.

Kyoto city hosts around 20% of Japan’s listed National 
Treasures and about 15% of Japan’s Important Cultural 
Properties. It is also home to the UNESCO World 
Heritage Site “Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto” 
which encompasses 15 sites within the city and its 
immediate vicinity.

RESILIENCE 
BACKGROUND

As the ancient capital of Japan, Heian-Kyo, Kyoto City 
has been continuously governed for over 1200 years. 
As one of the world’s most ancient living cities, Kyoto 
has honed its resilience in the face of countless shocks 
and stresses including natural disasters, epidemics and 
civil wars. 

Kyoto city places a strong emphasis on the importance 
of intangible assets that are fundamental to our 
resilience. Our greatest assets include experience, 
culture and social cohesion. Our experience comes 
from learning from centuries of overcoming disasters 
and challenges, we seek to constantly apply this 
experience in our daily governance. Kyoto’s traditional 
culture is a living asset that we value just as highly as 
physical assets. Our social and community cohesion 
stems from citizens with a strong sense of civic pride 
and responsibility, it has kept Kyoto functioning despite 
centuries of shocks and stresses.

Along with cities around the world, Japan’s cities are 
facing more frequent and severe challenges. As Japan’s 
cities have become more populated and developed, 
new challenges have emerged including a declining 
and aging population and the erosion of social 
cohesion. Our cities are also increasingly vulnerable to 
natural disasters such as flooding and earthquake. The 
Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 brought home for 
many in Japan the importance of resilience as a way to 
prepare for and recover from disaster. 

Due to combined global trends such as globalization, 
population displacement and climate change, the 
future is increasingly unclear. The practice of urban 
resilience rises to this challenge by enabling cities to 
prepare for an unpredictable future. This is why Kyoto 
City has made a commitment to review, refine and 
reinforce our unique approach to resilience so that our 
city can continue to survive and thrive in centuries to 
come.

RESILIENT KYOTO  |  STRATEGY OVERVIEW

KYOTO’S 
RESILIENCE CHALLENGES

Kyoto is grappling with a range of stresses that weaken the fabric of the city which effects its development  
and its ability to overcome future shocks. 

1. 

Increasing need for disaster preparedness for natural and human-induced shocks such as floods, 
earthquakes, terrorist attacks.

Increasing social isolation due to the break-down of community cohesion.

2.  Declining and aging population in urban areas.
3. 
4.  Deteriorating natural and cultural heritage, including a decline in traditional cultural practices.
5.  Declining local economy.
6.  Land blight caused by abandoned houses.
7.  Deterioration of urban landscapes due to a combination of all of these stresses.
8.  Declining natural environment due to global and local environmental impacts.

THIS STRATEGY

Kyoto’s Resilience Strategy is the culmination of work 
by people from across government departments, 
sectors and stakeholder groups, coming together to 
consider Kyoto’s shared resilience challenges that are 
outlined on page 8.

This Strategy was developed with the support of 100 
Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the Rockefeller
Foundation (100RC). Kyoto City has also made a deep 
commitment to implementing the United Nation’s 
Sustainable Development Goals (2030 Agenda) 
which are included on page 10. Each of the Strategy’s 
Initiatives contribute to one or more of the SDGs which 
is indicated in the Initiatives Index starting on page 18. 

In May 2016, Kyoto was selected from over 300 
applicant cities around the world to be among the 
third wave of 32 cities to join the 100 Resilient Cities 
Program. In February 2017, Kyoto began the process of 
developing its resilience strategy which is outlined on 
the right.

RESILIENT KYOTO  |  STRATEGY OVERVIEW

FEBRUARY 2017: 
Agenda Setting Workshop with more than 90 
representatives from municipal and national 
government departments, as well as public utility, 
economic, non-profit, religious, academic and 
citizen stakeholders. The objective was to define 
urban resilience, identify and rank shocks and 
stresses, and begin to understand the capacity of 
the city to face these challenges. 

APRIL 2017: 
CRO was appointed
MARCH 2018: 
Preliminary Resilience Assessment of Kyoto 
completed following broad consultation with 
stakeholders and review of available data and 
studies. 6 Discovery Areas for further study were 
identified:
•  Population – declining and aging population 

and its effect on urban vitality.

•  Community – declining engagement by 

citizen’s in community activities, particularly 
the working population.

•  Culture, Arts and Crafts – declining local 

traditional practices and industries.

•  Built Environment and Infrastructure – the 

challenge of upgrading aging infrastructure 
whilst preserving Kyoto’s unique built 
heritage, cityscape and landscapes.

•  Environment – the need to protect Kyoto’s 

natural environment in the face of local 
degradation and global climate change.
•  Disaster Risk – the ever-present need to 

ensure that the city is prepared for future 
disasters.

MARCH 2018 TO MARCH 2019: 
Co-designing Kyoto’s Strategy – mobilization of 
Kyoto government departments and stakeholders 
to conduct enquiries and develop responses 
to these Discovery Areas. The results of and 
response to the enquiries are contained in this 
Strategy.

RESILIENT KYOTO  |  STRATEGY OVERVIEW

STRATEGY 
IMPLEMENTATION

This strategy is unique in that it works across 
government departments and stakeholder groups in 
the city to advance the sustainability and resilience of 
Kyoto’s society, economy and environment. As such, 
the strategy has planned work that will span decades 
(2019 – 2040). It’s implementation arrangements and 
guiding principles have been established to ensure 
that the work continues to embrace a cross-cutting 
resilience lens.
 

Implementation of the Strategy will be led by a Special 
Committee titled “Kyoto Creation Integrated Strategy,
Headquarters for SDGs”. This Committee will be led by 
the Mayor, Vice-Mayors, Chief Resilience Officer and 
the Directors of Departments and Wards. The Special 
Committee is also charged with implementing the city’s 
SDG commitments and the city’s Local Revitalization 
Plan.

The strategy’s implementation will require a  
whole-of-government effort as the initiatives are 
spread across all the different departments of Kyoto 
city government. Most initiatives also commit to 
partnering with citizens, local communities, non-
profits, vulnerable communities, universities and/or the 
business community.

The Chief Resilience Officer and the Resilience Office 
are charged with the day-to-day coordination of the 
implementation of the Strategy across 18 government 
departments, 11 ward offices and 3 branch offices.

Progress of the Strategy’s implementation will be 
monitored, evaluated and reported on through Kyoto 
City’s rigorous internal review system that includes 
annual reporting. As a cross-departmental program 
of work, the new initiatives will be monitored and 
reported on separately.

12

FIVE PRINCIPLES 

THESE PRINCIPLES WILL GUIDE THE WORK OF THE STRATEGY AT ALL LEVELS.

1. INTEGRATE ALL POLICIES
All urban policy is relevant to resilience-building, this strategy seeks to work across Kyoto city’s diverse policy 
fields to re-evaluate and integrate them using a resilience lens.

2. INVOLVE ALL STAKEHOLDERS
This strategy was developed in deep consultation with Kyoto’s communities including citizens, non-profits 
and businesses. The success of this strategy depends on the continuation of this engagement with all 
stakeholders.

3. INNOVATE METHODS
This strategy embraces innovation in approaches and technologies to find new solutions to our  
greatest resilience challenges.

4. EMBRACE UNCERTAINTY
In the face of potential shocks and stresses, lack of certainty cannot be used as an excuse for inaction.
This strategy commits to working with stakeholders to take action to prepare for an unpredictable future with 
open minds.

5. CONVERT CHALLENGES INTO OPPORTUNITIES
Our aim is not simply to respond to problems or challenges (shocks and stresses) but to also take the 
opportunity to achieve a higher level of resilience in the city overall. This Strategy makes a commitment to 
continually applying lessons learned to improve the city’s wellbeing and prosperity.

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

18 Goals sit under each pillar and underlying the Goals are suite of Initiatives (refer “Strategy at a Glance Figure”). 
There are two types of Initiatives:

NEW INITIATIVES
This Strategy does not have all the answers to 
Kyoto’s resilience challenges. However, it introduces a 
commitment to bringing innovation and collaboration 
to seeking these answers. Kyoto City Government 
has committed to nine new cross-governmental and 
cross- sector programs of work that will continue to 
bring the Resilience Principles to Kyoto’s greatest 
resilience challenges, which are called “New Initiatives”. 
Considering the New Initiatives are still in the design 
phase, their timeframes will be determined as part 
of the detailed design phase after this strategy is 
launched.

These initiatives are special projects that will be led by 
the Kyoto Resilience Office.

LEADING INITIATIVES
The Strategy has also identified many projects that 
are already planned or underway in the city that are 
addressing our resilience priorities, which are called 
“Leading Initiatives”. By bringing this work together 
under the canopy of the Resilience Strategy, we are 
creating connection and collaboration between these 
diverse projects. 

All the Leading Initiatives in the Kyoto Resilience 
Strategy require long implementation terms (more than 
10 years) in order to undertake an organizational and 
systemic change process to become more resilient. 
These initiatives now come under the supervision and 
guidance of the Special Committee which is charged 
with ensuring collaboration between the initiatives 
guided by the principles.

promote social cohesion, 
Providing mental health support 
to young adults and their 
parents, and

•  Comprehensive family planning 

support for families from pre-

Through this initiative local schools 
will engage parents and communities 
in school management through 
promoting more open school 
management, expanding the 
establishment of School Councils and 
connecting parents of students with 
each other.
This initiative will build the resilience 
of Kyoto’s childcare support network 
(childcare centers and Kindergarten) 
through capacity building and 
funding for teachers and school 
managers to improve and grow their 
services.
This initiative will engage young 
people in democracy and governance 
from a young age in the school 
environment.

The initiative seeks to connect young 
leaders of all ages with opportunities 
to become good citizens who take 
responsibility for social issues in their 
city. The initiative will emphasize 
the importance of democracy and 
elections. The initiative will work 
closely with schools (pre-K to high 
school) to introduce this opportunity 
to all students in Kyoto.

By providing holistic and 
practical healthcare support 
for families at every stage of 
life, this initiative responds 
to a number of Kyoto’s social 
stresses, particularly low 
birth rate, social isolation and 
mental health issues. 

By harnessing their local 
communities, schools 
will improve the school 
environment and build social 
cohesion that is critical to 
Kyoto’s resilience.

By providing practical 
and financial support to 
Kyoto’s childcare centers 
and Kindergartens including 
teachers, Kyoto will build the 
resilience of their youngest 
citizens and their parents.
This initiative will promote 
citizen engagement with 
Kyoto’s political and 
governance system. It will 
provide students of all ages 
with an understanding of 
the government system 
and engender a sense of 
responsibility for good 
citizenship.

Cross-cutting Initiative 5-3-1 also delivers on this Goal.

Seismic 
Retrofitting 
of Private

This initiative will work with 
community groups in Kyoto’s 
traditional row housing areas 
that are characterized by housing 
density and narrow streets. It 
will work with community and 
business leaders as well as diverse 
stakeholders to provide expert 
advice in planning for disaster 
including local awareness raising 
and identifying evacuation 
pathways.
This initiative will use a smartphone 
application to create a direct 
communication channel between 
citizens and local government to 
communicate damage to local 
facilities and infrastructure such 
as pavements and guardrails. In 
this way, local government will be 
informed more quickly of necessary 
maintenance works that local 
citizens consider to be important. 
The application will also engender a 
spirit of collaboration between city 
government and citizens.
Through this initiative support 
will be provided to private 
homeowners to ensure that their 
properties are as safe as possible 
in the face of an earthquake. This 
program will include a public 
awareness campaign, specialist 
assessments and subsidized seismic 
strengthening works to priority 
homes.

This initiative will seek to 
maximize public safety 
and disaster preparedness 
through working with 
community and business 
leaders and diverse 
stakeholders in vulnerable 
areas (row houses with 
narrow streets).

This initiative will use ICT 
technology to enhance 
communication between 
the public and government 
to maintain and enhance 
the city’s assets. Co-
benefits include community 
participation in public 
infrastructure management 
and civic pride.

This initiative will increase 
the safety of private 
housing by supporting 
residents to ensure their 
homes are earthquake-
safe. Co-benefits include 
protecting and enhancing 
heritage properties and 
landscapes through using 
traditional building methods 
and materials.

Cross-cutting initiative 5-1-1 also delivers on this Goal.

in relation to Kyoto’s most 
precious cultural assets and 
their caretakers.

This initiative will build 
emergency response 
capacity and coordination 
in local communities, 
particularly for women and 
youth.

This initiative will build the capacity 
to Kyoto’s network of evacuation 
sites and centers to provide safe 
shelter during a disaster. These sites 
and centers are public facilities 
such as schools and community 
halls. The initiative will confirm that 
all the centers have the necessary 
equipment and supplies. It will 
also ensure that all nominated 
community leads for each center 
have the necessary training.
This initiative will provide 
emergency response training to 
Kyoto’s tourism industry including 
guides as well as transport 
providers. The training will equip 
industry members to use best 
practice in responding to disaster 
conditions in a way that maximizes 
safety and protects cultural 
heritage assets before emergency 
response professionals reach the 
site.
Kyoto has a strong network of 
volunteer Fire Brigades that are 
deployed in response to most 
disasters including earthquake 
and flooding. The volunteer Fire 
Brigades include qualified part-
time emergency responders as well 
as student volunteers trained to 
provide auxiliary support.

This initiative will seek to grow 
these effective community service 
groups by recruiting and training 
more volunteers, particularly young 
people and women.

RESILIENT KYOTO  |  STRATEGY OVERVIEW

MESSAGE FROM THE CRO

The Resilience of Your City Starts with You!

Thank you for reading Kyoto’s Resilience 
Strategy!

“After missing a goal in sports, I changed my 
strategy and ended up winning the game.”  

The word “resilience” may seem unfamiliar, 
but I’m sure we can all find examples of 
“resilience” in our daily lives, do any of the 
below examples sound familiar?

“When our company was in a difficult 
situation, our employees rose to the challenge 
and we became a stronger and more cohesive 
team.”  

“After bouncing back from a shocking 
experience, I realized that I had become a 
more mature person.” 

“When I committed to rehabilitation after 
breaking my leg, I found that the muscles 
around my leg became stronger than before 
the accident.” 

The resilience of a city starts with the 
resilience of its people – the more we 
can identify and share our own personal 
resilience-building experiences, the more 
resilient we will become as a society. 

Let’s come together to build the resilience of 
our communities and our future generations!
