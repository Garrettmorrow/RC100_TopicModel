Resilient CalgaryA MESSAGE FROM 
THE MAYOR
I bring you greetings from a place called Moh’kinsstis 
— the Elbow, a place where two great rivers meet . In 
Calgary, we are all Treaty 7 people . It’s the traditional 
Indigenous territory of the Blackfoot people (Siksika, 
Kainai, Piikani, Amskapi Pikuni), the Beaver people of 
the Tsuu T’ina Nation and the Stoney Nakoda Nations 
people (Bearspaw, Chiniki and Wesley), a place where 
we walk in the footprints of the Métis and our Inuit 
sisters and brothers from across Canada and around 
the world . 
People have been coming here for thousands of 
years to hunt, fish, trade, live and love  - but above all, 
to build community . 
On behalf of my City Council colleagues and the 
citizens of Calgary, I am very excited to be launching 
our Resilient Calgary strategy .
Calgary has been through many stresses and 
shocks . In fact, half of Canada’s 10 costliest disasters 
have happened in Calgary . We have been through 
a devastating flood, a tree-crushing September 
snowstorm, hail and high wind events . We are 
continuing to recover from an economic downturn and 
the accompanying employment loss . Together, we have 
picked up and kept moving forward – continuously 
rebuilding and reimagining our community .
This Resilient Calgary strategy builds on the lessons 
applied through our historical stress and shock 
experiences, and focuses on our future . Resilience 
can mean many things . It is about community spirit, 
it is about being able to step in, help out and emerge 
stronger together . A truly resilient community is one 
where the economy, infrastructure, natural areas 
and an inclusive society empower everyone with the 
opportunity to make a great life in our city .  
I want to thank everyone: our community partners, 
the citizens who participated in this work, our 
guiding stakeholders and City Administration for 
the part you have played in developing our Resilient 
Calgary strategy . Because it includes many of your 
voices and input, I hope you consider it yours .
This reflects the best of our 
city, and I know that with all 
of us working together as a 
community, we will become 
even more resilient .
Sincerely,

Mayor Naheed Nenshi

Resilient CalgaryA MESSAGE FROM THE 
CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER
Calgary: we are, indeed, resilient .
Our community is vibrant, hard-working, optimistic, 
diverse and energetic . There is a spirit to our city 
that welcomes guests, supports neighbours, finds 
solutions when faced with a challenge and shares joy 
in each other’s success .
We are a great city because of our community 
spirit . As a community, we have risen above many 
stresses and shocks . We have in recent years, 
together, withstood a flood, managed damaging 
snow storms, cleaned up from hail and high winds, 
helped each  other find approaches and solutions to 
mental wellness, welcomed new Canadian residents, 
engaged our community to create approaches to 
affordable housing and are innovatively addressing 
our persistent economic downturn . These examples 
demonstrate the true spirit of Calgary and the true 
strength of resilience .
The development of this resilience strategy 
has been the result of consultations with our 
community, workshops with partners, connecting 
with organizations and subject matter experts, and 
learning from all of their research and experiences . 
Together, we have placed a lens on the most urgent 
resilience issues, lifted our awareness of each 
other’s efforts to build resilience and leveraged our 
collective action . We have constructed this strategy 
on the foundation of resilience work that has come 
before us, and have linked this work to resilience 
work already in action . Without everyone’s passion, 
dedication and knowledge, this strategy would not 
be possible .
Thank you for being a key part of Calgary’s resilience .

Chief Resilience Officer and Deputy City Manager

Resilient CalgaryEXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Calgary has a vision: a great place to make a living, a great place to 
make a life . We have a long history of imagining our community, 
developing actions to accomplish our collective goals, and together 
chartering new aspirations . Along this journey we have had our share  
of disruptions — the chronic stresses, such as not being inclusive 
of multiple perspectives, and employment rates that shadow our 
economic downturn, and acute shocks, such as the 2013 flood — that 
can keep us from reaching our vision . Time and time again, we join 
together, support each other, learn from our experiences, and use this 
shared journey to set new goals .
In 2013, Calgary experienced a significant disaster 
event that disrupted our community, our economy, 
our infrastructure and our natural environment . 
Water from our mountain-fed rivers, combined with 
saturated earth from a long winter and recent heavy 
rainfall created a flood not experienced in a century . 
Our downtown, the heart of Calgary, was closed as 
water drained from its streets . People and businesses 
were evacuated from their homes and livelihoods, 
and critical infrastructure impacts halted services . 
We learned a lot, together, about responding and 
recovering, repairing and funding, communicating 
priorities and setting recovery goals . What is most 
memorable is the community spirit that lifted our 
hearts, hands working together to support each other, 
and the commitment by all to regain our beloved 
Calgary . 
This optimism and hope experienced during the 2013 
flood has driven us to be better, to invest in resilience, 
and to continue efforts together to meet our vision 

for Calgary . We have learned that a city’s ability to 
function is often weakened by chronic stress (such 
as economic uncertainty, climate change, poverty, 
increased unemployment) and acute shocks (like 
financial crisis, extreme weather, infrastructure failure) . 
Careful attention to local, regional and national 
trends and events, intentional goal setting and taking 
collective action can help a city improve its ability to 
respond effectively and serve its population . 
After experiencing our 2013 flood, we decided to 
be intentional about understanding the things 
that could disrupt our quality of life . The journey to 
develop this Resilient Calgary strategy has helped us 
identify what our greatest stresses and shocks might 
be, encouraged us to explore these disruptors and 
gather knowledge about our readiness for them, and 
compelled us to identify the specific goals and actions 
to move us forward toward our vision of Calgary as a 
sustainable, resilient place .

Executive Summary

6

Resilient CalgaryThe strategy development occurred in three specific 
phases . The first was to host a conversation about 
resilience in our community and gather perceptions 
of what our stresses and shocks might be .  This 
was a natural conversation in Calgary following the 
2013 flood event . As we worked on flood recovery, 
we analyzed our vulnerabilities during that event 
and recognized there were specific focus areas that 
required deliberate recovery and resilience efforts .  
These included intentionally supporting  
our community with services as they rebuilt 
their homes and businesses, ensuring our critical 
infrastructure was able to support service delivery, 
managing the financial impacts of the event to 
keep our economy and City finances strong and 
communicating our recovery progress and resilience 
building as a community . 
Through our flood recovery work, and early 
conversations about the pending economic downturn, 
we built on the heightened awareness of resilience 
present in our community . Council supported the 
maturation of the recovery team into a resilience team 
in the 2014-2018 budget and business plan . It was 
this resilience focus that supported our application 
to the 100 Resilient Cities network, and we were 
accepted as a member in 2016 . Our Deputy City 
Manager was appointed as Chief Resilience Officer in 
2017 . We participated in engagement activities such 
as the Agenda Setting Workshop and the Downtown 
Economic Summit in 2017, conducted focus group 
sessions and gathered information through The City 
of Calgary Customer Satisfaction Survey among other 
sources of data . 

This first phase of intentionally building resilience 
awareness was quickly followed by phase two: 
the opportunity to pair our shock and stress 
perceptions with statistical information and research, 
activities underway in our community, and the 
goals and actions identified in many City and 
community strategies and plans .  The Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment (available at www .calgary .ca/
resilientcalgary) was shared with Council in March of 
2018 and reflected our assessment of these stresses 
and shocks, supported the One Calgary 2019-2022 
service plan and budget process, and helped us 
prioritize the four discovery areas for the third phase 
of work to develop the strategy . From June 2018 until 
March 2019, working collaboratively with community, 
an opportunity assessment was conducted resulting in 
the Resilient Calgary strategy . 
The outcomes, goals and actions of the strategy 
support Citizen Priorities and Council Directives 
identified within the One Calgary 2019-2022 service 
plans and budgets . Our community has joined us 
in this conversation along the way as we worked to 
understand our potential risks and to develop the 
key strategies and actions to address these risks . The 
result is a strategy that enables Calgary to continue 
our long tradition of resilience . We are acting now, 
are future-focused and flexible for technological 
innovation, economic diversity, strong infrastructure, 
environmental sustainability and social change for our 
community: for today and for generations to come .

The fabric of Calgary is woven from the many colourful threads of its people, its landmarks and 
its stories . Calgary’s Poet Laureate and Resilience Strategy champion, Sheri-D Wilson, reached 
out to Calgary’s arts community, asking people to share their thoughts on resilience through 
perspectives of our landmarks, our shared memories and our journey together . They were 
asked to fill in the following:

“ I’ll meet you at (a real place or landmark in Calgary) and then 
we’ll (a publishable activity).” 

 
This journey can be found throughout the strategy reflecting our past while we dream  
of our future . 

Sheri-D Wilson 

“  I’ll meet you at the Palliser Hotel when it was the tallest 
building, and then we’ll go and lie down among wild flowers, 
at the meeting of rivers; and spend the afternoon listening to 
grasshopper song.”

Alberta University of the Arts The inspiring illustrations used throughout this resilience strategy are the result of a collaboration between The City 
of Calgary and Alberta University of the Arts. Under the guidance of the Resilience team and AUA faculty, students were asked to create artwork that 
represented the challenges facing Calgary and its need for becoming a resilient city. What appears on these pages are the expressions of their talent 
and imagination.

The Resilient Calgary strategy 
includes four pillars and a  
shared theme: 
Pillar 1: The Future of Calgary’s Economy 
Pillar 2: Inclusive Futures 
Pillar 3: The Future of Calgary’s Natural Infrastructure 
Pillar 4: Future Ready Infrastructure 
Shared theme: A Future Focused Calgary
Actions are described in each pillar that highlight  
the collaborative interests of resilience work and goals 
to achieve .

Pillar 1: The Future of Calgary’s Economy
Our urban environment and the economic 
engine that supports it are interconnected . 

As a resource-based economy, Calgary is often at 
the mercy of global forces . In 1981, world oil prices 
collapsed leading to high unemployment and 
bankruptcy . Again in 2015, dropping prices led to 
thousands of job losses and a provincial recession . We 
remain committed to a strong economy, are preparing 
for a digital and technological shift, and want our 
community to have skills that support the jobs of the 
future . We are in the midst of a structural economic 
change, and our can-do attitude and willingness to 
embrace innovation bring brightness to an otherwise 
testing time .

Pillar 2: Inclusive Futures
The people of our community support one 
another, working together to keep our city‘s 
heart beating proudly . We welcome new people and 
work to find homes for all of our community members . 
We collectively share resources and ideas to address 
wellness . Since the 2013 flood, we join together each 
year in June for Neighbour Day, we proudly shop 
locally, and we are vocal about the values we hold 
dear . We are learning ways of knowing, engaging, 
building relationships and moving toward equitable 
environments with Indigenous peoples . Our greatest 
strength in Calgary is that of the people who live, 
visit and dream of being here . This strategy aims to 
nurture personal resilience through our connections 
to each other, our equity-seeking communities, our 
environment and the services we enjoy that support 
our quality of life .

The Resilient Calgary strategy is built on 4 PILLARS 

and ONE SHARED THEME …

 … which measure 5 GOALS …

… tracking progress toward 13 OUTCOMES …

… and 29 ACTIONS which aim to achieve specific 

policies, programs or practices that Calgary will 

initiate to reach our resilience goals .

39 SUCCESS MEASURES AND  
METRICS are included while …

22 RESILIENCE IN ACTION spotlights provide 

an opportunity to highlight an activity in our 

Calgary community that strengthens our resilience 

to stresses and shocks.

Resilient CalgaryResilience in Action
A key learning through the development of the 
strategy is that there are incredible examples of 
resilience activities already occurring in Calgary that 
support our community’s resilience . Resilience in 
Action stories in the strategy showcase great work 
already being championed in our community that 
support the strategy outcomes .
Being a vibrant, great city that is world revered, is the 
result of our community spirit, our hardworking ethic, 
our welcoming kindness and the natural beauty within 
and around our city . The rest of the world has been 
watching . In 2018, The Economist magazine ranked 
Calgary as the best city to live in North America, and 
the fourth best city in the world . Even with these 
strengths, Calgary will continue to face stresses and 
shocks as we strive to reach our vision of being a great 
place to make a living and a great place to make a life . 
The Resilient Calgary strategy belongs to us all, and 
as we work together to implement the strategy, we 
will continue to identify new risks, support those with 
collective effort, and sustain our great city’s resilience 
into the future .

Pillar 3: The Future of Calgary’s Natural 
Infrastructure 
Our connection to our natural environment 

is deeply tied to our daily activities: during any season, 
we are acutely aware of the icy coldness dropping 
temperatures can bring, the warmth of a winter 
Chinook, the long dry and hot days of our summers . 
We bravely face these weather changes, none more 
great in recent memory than the perfect storm of 
snow in our mountains, our water-saturated earth,  
and a well placed rainstorm to the west . The flood 
of 2013 galvanized a city-wide response as rising 
waters forced the evacuation of thousands of people 
from more than 26 communities . This was not the 
first time Calgary faced flooding — in 1929 and 
1932, both the Bow and Elbow Rivers breached their 
banks after heavy rain . We have learned from our 
past and are preparing for our future by learning the 
value of natural infrastructure and will be better at 
considering it as an asset when budgeting, planning 
and developing Calgary communities .

Pillar 4: Future Ready Infrastructure 
Cities globally struggle with balancing new 
infrastructure needs and operations and 

maintenance of existing community assets . Intentional 
investment in infrastructure will support our resilience 
to technological advances, shocking weather events 
and chronic aging of our assets . 

Shared theme: A Future Focused Calgary
These four pillars of the strategy are 
supported by outcomes of population 

wellness and performance change by government, 
business and institutions . The pillars are supported 
by a shared theme, A Future Focused Calgary, that 
includes the development of resilience tools to 
support our measurement and sustained resilience 
approach to planning and decision making .

then we will hear the chickadees and 
the pine-boughs whisper.”

Resilient CalgaryRESILIENT CALGARY STRATEGY: AN OVERVIEW
To keep Calgary strong, we must be prepared for stresses and 
shocks . The Resilient Calgary strategy supports a vision of resilience 
for Calgary that considers events that weaken the people, natural 
environment, economy and urban systems of our city .
The strategy places Calgary’s resilience challenges and opportunities into four over-arching pillars and one 
shared theme . From infrastructure and economy to environment and inclusion, we have taken a deep dive 
into these pillar areas and have identified 13 outcomes, 29 actions and more than 39 success measures that 
help shape our plan going forward . With the guidance of community, partners, our steering committee and 
diverse stakeholders, we state creative, bold and innovative actions to get us there .

SHARED THEME: A Future Focused Calgary 
All pillars use a future-focused lens when advancing resilience outcomes and actions .

PILLAR 1: 
The Future of 
Calgary’s Economy

All community 
members are 
encouraged and 
able to participate 
in a diverse and 
strong economy .

PILLAR 2: 
Inclusive Futures

Institutions 
have trusted 
and informed 
relationships 
with Calgary’s 
equity-seeking 
communities .

PILLAR 3: 
The Future of 
Calgary’s Natural 
Infrastructure 

Natural 
infrastructure assets 
are identified, 
protected, tracked, 
managed and 
used to inform 
investment and 
planning decisions .

PILLAR 4: 
Future Ready 
Infrastructure

Calgarians are 
supported through 
strategic investment 
in future-focused 
and resilient 
infrastructure .

Resilient Calgary strategy: An Overview

11

Resilient CalgaryCALGARY’S STRESSES, SHOCKS, CHALLENGES  
AND OPPORTUNITIES

Our past experiences must help inform future decisions . Calgary faces many challenges including chronic 
stresses (slow moving activities that weaken the fabric of a city over time) and acute shocks (sudden, sharp 
events or disasters that threaten a city) . We investigated these stresses and shocks during our Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment . Together as a community, we have assessed our risks and vulnerabilities, taken stock 
of our existing efforts to reduce these risks, and identified the priority areas for our continued efforts to build 
resilience . Embedded in each pillar of the Resilient Calgary strategy are outcomes that describe our resilience 
goals, actions that identify the work we will take on together, and Resilience in Action (RIA) stories that showcase 
some of the many Calgary community activities well underway . The table below ties together the key pieces of 
the strategy: our stresses and shocks, the strategy pillars, outcomes and actions, and illustrations of resilience 
champions at work .

The process to develop the Resilient Calgary strategy has been a shared 
journey . We have gathered in workshops, engaged at open houses, 
captured ideas online and in focus group sessions, meetings and key 
stakeholder discussions . Face to face, steering committee members, 
colleagues and collaboration circle members have shared and planned 
together . The voices of many diverse stakeholders were heard 
including community partners, Indigenous groups, platform partners, 
subject matter experts and City of Calgary business units .

Resilient CalgarySUPPORTING OUR JOURNEY

We are Guided
A Letter from the Resilient Calgary  
Steering Committee
The members of the steering committee are 
honoured to be a part of the development of the 
Resilient Calgary strategy . We bring perspectives 
from many different backgrounds, with a variety 
of interests and working in an array of professions 
and businesses . Our conversations as a steering 
committee have helped elevate critical issues of 
importance in the strategy development, of our 
collective work, and more knowledge of our ever-
changing world where we all face complex stresses 
and shocks .
Resilience should be the cornerstone of the 
future of our communities . The work that went 
into creating the strategy and the actions in this 
document demonstrate the value of resilience to help 
achieve a good quality of life in our city for all of its 
people . A resilient economy, natural infrastructure, 
and inclusive communities supported by sound 
infrastructure are key for the well-being of our people 
and help achieve our best quality of life .
Calgary is a strong community, and our goal has 
been to build on that foundation of strength . As 
a steering committee we feel that this Resilient 
Calgary strategy is an important step taken together 
to help future generations survive and thrive 
through the many stresses and shocks that Calgary 
will face . The different pillars, outcomes and actions 
in this strategy document create an opportunity for 
us to lift our collective awareness of stress, shocks, 
challenges and opportunities, place a lens on each 
other’s good work, and leverage our collective effort 
to seek resilience value for Calgary .

We are grateful to be part of this journey, and 
we anticipate continuing to champion this work 
through its implementation to help ensure that our 
communities remain on this resilience path . It is 
our hope that the work initiated through Resilient 
Calgary will continue to be embedded in our plans, 
actions and efforts — supported by each other — 
so that we can continue being a community that is 
optimistic, future-focused and resilient . 

Steering Committee and members

leaders in Calgary
Calgary is enriched by a diversity of people and 
businesses, professional and technical experts, 
foundations, non-profits, social service providers and 
academic institutions — all of whom are committed to 
resilience . The creation of the Resilient Calgary strategy 
is the result of many thought leaders who dedicated 
their time, expertise and research to shape its direction . 
Experts and community leaders offered countless 
hours to attend stakeholder workshops, steering 
committees and discovery area collaboration circles . 
Together, we articulated Calgary’s resilience goals and 
recognized our potential for a brighter future . We wish 
to acknowledge the following:

Resilient CalgaryWe Are Not Alone
Why Urban Resilience Matters
The world is rapidly changing . As urbanization 
and urban populations keep rising, cities will be 
increasingly exposed to different challenges and 
risks . Climate change, increase in migration, aging 
and diverse populations, infrastructure demands, 
the transformation of public management and social 
inequality are all challenges to which cities must be 
able to respond .

What makes a city vulnerable?
Cities are complex systems . Their cultural, social and 
economic wealth is based largely on the extensive 
network of connections between people, institutions, 
stakeholders, infrastructure and ecosystems . If the 
risks and extent of the consequences are not known, 
complex urban systems may become vulnerable to 
stresses and shocks . It’s important to identify the 
outside factors that contribute to the transformation 
of the environment, just as it’s important to identify 
the potential shocks and stresses of the city .

Chronic Stresses and Acute Shocks
Cities are the primary centres of economic activity, 
social connection, opportunity and innovation . A 
city’s ability to function is often weakened by acute 
shock (financial crisis, extreme weather, cyberattack, 
etc .) and chronic stress (economic uncertainty, climate 
change, poverty, increased unemployment, etc .) . 
Unexpected shock or stress situations that accumulate 
may lead to social unrest, the collapse of infrastructure 
or even the economic decline of a city . The challenge 
of shock and stress situations may, however, create 
interest and opportunities to build resilience .

What is Urban Resilience?
Urban resilience is the capacity of individuals, 
institutions, businesses and systems within a city 
to adapt, survive and thrive no matter what kind of 
chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience .

Who else is focused on Urban Resilience?
100 Resilient Cities (100RC), is a network established 
in 2013 to help cities around the world become 
more resilient to the physical, social and economic 
challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century . 
100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a 
view of resilience that includes not just the shocks but 

also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a 
day-to-day or cyclical basis . By addressing both the 
shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to 
respond to adverse events, and is overall better able to 
deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to 
all populations .

Four main pathways
Cities in the 100RC network are provided with 
the resources necessary to develop a roadmap to 
resilience along four main pathways:
1 .  Financial and logistical guidance for establishing an 
innovative new position in city government, a Chief 
Resilience Officer, who will lead the city’s resilience 
efforts .

2 .  Expert support for development of a robust 

resilience strategy .

3 .  Access to solutions, service providers and partners 
from the private, public and NGO sectors who can 
help them develop and implement their resilience 
strategies .

4 .  Membership in a global network of member cities 

who can learn from and help each other .

Through these actions, 100RC helped individual cities 
become more resilient, and has facilitated the building 
of a global practice of resilience among governments, 
NGOs, the private sector and individual citizens .

Calgary invited to join
The City of Calgary was among the third and final 
cohort of cities invited by 100RC to embark on an 
exciting opportunity to examine city resilience and 
develop a strategy that is customized according 
to individualized needs and capacity . Calgary has 
participated in the 100RC Network membership 
from the onset of our Agenda Setting Workshop in 
2017, and we will remain a member until the end of 
July, 2019 when the 100 Resilient Cities program will 
formally end . The connections made through the 
international membership network, the support of 
a strategy partner and platform partners, and the 
coaching from resilience minded subject matter 
experts was an important contributor to Calgary’s 
resilience strategy development .

Global Resilience Efforts
Calgary has learned from and connected with many global cities as 
a result of our membership in the 100 Resilient Cities network . This 
connection to other Chief Resilience Officers, network members, 
partners and resilience champions has inspired and informed the 
development of our strategy .

Resilient CalgaryTeam Canada: Along with Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, 
Calgary is one of four Canadian cities in the 100RC network. 
The four member cities participate in monthly conference calls. 
The purpose of convening is to bring together the four Chief 
Resilience Officers (CROs) and their teams, as well as resilience 
practitioners from Canada and elsewhere to:
a) Advance and illuminate the state of urban resilience in Canada. 
The four Canadian member cities of the 100RC network each 
have unique challenges and opportunities — the diversity of 
urban centres and metropolitan areas is vast in Canada. Each 
of the CROs are leading their cities through a transformational 
process to institutionalize resilience in their operations and 
partnerships.
b) Share emerging learnings, best practices and innovations. 
Since cities are different, they often also adapt to change and 
innovate in different ways — but solutions and ideas can be 
shared to build regional or national economies of scale.

c) Connect with national and international practitioners and 
thinkers to advance urban resilience in Canada. Municipal 
governments alone cannot build resilience in communities — 
it takes great partnerships, new technologies, resources and 
leadership. Leading experts have presented on a wide range 
of topics including urban modelling, strategic foresight, risk 
profiling tools, Future of Work in Canada, Truth & Reconciliation 
and more.
d) Initiate conception of a national Urban Resilience Agenda for 
Canada. A significant proportion of the Canadian population is 
represented by cities building their resilience. Opportunities are 
being explored for national engagement and national impact, 
cross-city solutions, and new philanthropic investment in a pan- 
Canada initiative.

Resilient CalgaryThis strategy is a comprehensive action plan to 
institutionalize resilience as an anchor for city 
decision-making and long-term planning . The 
Resilient Calgary strategy is the result of the made-
in-Calgary“3L” approach: an intentional effort 
to place a lens on the most pressing resilience 
risks and issues, to lift awareness of the good 
work already underway and to identify areas 
to fortify, and to leverage the collective effort 
of many to reach shared resilience goals .  This 
approach positions The City and its community 
to make decisions and investments that are risk-
aware, inclusive and integrated, while producing 
economic, social, and physical benefits for all .
Calgary is now poised to be a global example 
of how cities can leverage resilience strategies 
to embed the practice of resilience and catalyze 
action through implementation . On behalf of 
100RC, I would like to congratulate Mayor Nenshi 
and Calgary City Council, the City of Calgary, and 
its residents and stakeholders on the release of 
Resilient Calgary and share our excitement for 
your continued journey toward achieving the 
vision set forth in this very important strategy .  

 

Michael Berkowitz 
President, 100 Resilient Cities

A letter from the 100 Resilient Cities 
At 100 Resilient Cities, we have worked with cities 
across the globe on their journeys to becoming 
more resilient . The release of Resilient Calgary 
marks an important milestone on Calgary’s 
path . With its high capacity resilience team and 
ambitious political leadership, The City of Calgary 
has made bold moves to change the way it does 
business to ensure that the community will be 
more resilient over the long-term . In doing so, 
Calgary will be ready to face its most pressing 
stresses and shocks while prioritizing  the needs 
of its communities and residents . 
Calgary, the fourth largest city in Canada, began 
its resilience journey long before it joined the 
100RC network in 2016 . Home to many Indigenous 
communities, Calgary is proud of its history, 
growing diversity, and rich natural environment . 
Calgary’s story, however, is also one of loss and 
rebuilding . Through the devastating floods of 
2013 and the hard but steady recovery from 
an economic recession that began in 2015, the 
City of Calgary has been steadfast, reflecting on 
the impacts of these events and taking action 
to withstand both acute shocks and slowly 
emerging- stresses, while bringing opportunity 
and prosperity to its community . 
To this end, 100RC is humbled to be a partner 
in Calgary’s resilience journey . Calgary has been 
a leader in the global resilience movement; 
from sharing best practices and lessons learned 
with other cities at the 2018 Building Resilient 
Infrastructure Workshop in Washington D .C . 
to working with our Platform Partners, such as 
Earth Economics, who partnered with Calgary to 
develop an innovative natural assets decision-
making tool . We are excited to see our partnership 
culminate, under the leadership of Chief Resilience 
Officer Brad Stevens and the Calgary resilience 
team, with the release of Resilient Calgary .

Resilient CalgaryCHARACTERISTICS OF RESILIENT SYSTEMS

Resilient systems possess seven qualities that enable them to 
withstand, respond to and adapt more readily to shocks and stress by 
taking appropriate or prompt action . A resilient system is: reflective, 
resourceful, inclusive, integrated, robust, redundant, flexible .

Reflective
Using past experiences to inform future 
decisions .

Integrated
Bring together a range of distinct systems and 
institutions .

Inclusive
Wide-ranging consultation and sharing in 
decision-making processes .

Redundant
Spare capacity purposively created to 
accommodate disruption .

Robust
Well-conceived, constructed and managed 
systems .

Flexible
Willingness, ability to adopt alternative strategies 
in response to changing circumstances .

Resourceful
Recognizing alternative ways to use resources .

 Pam Rocker 

“ I’ll meet you in the middle of the bridge to St. Patrick’s island. We’ll fall in love as we 
navigate nature and ice cream, linking fingers as you point out the egrets staking 
claims atop steel structures, and we wander our way into our own nest.” 

Characteristics of resilient systems 

28

Resilient CalgaryTHE CITY RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK
The City Resilience Framework (CRF) is a lens used to help understand the complexity of cities and it identifies 
a series of drivers that have been proven to be necessary for a city’s resilience . The CRF describes the essential 
systems of a city in terms of four dimensions: Health & Well-being, Economy & Society, Infrastructure & 
Environment, and Leadership & Strategy . Each dimension contains three “drivers,” which reflect the actions cities 
can take to improve their resilience . 
Resilient Calgary’s actions align to all dimensions and nearly all drivers, with a focus on: fostering economic 
prosperity, supporting livelihoods and employment, meeting basic needs, fostering long-term and integrated 
planning, promoting leadership & effective management, promoting cohesive and engaged communities, 
empowering a broad range of stakeholders, ensuring continuity of critical services and maintaining and 
enhancing protective natural and man-made assets (infrastructure) . 
Mapping primary and secondary alignment of Resilient Calgary actions to the CRF drivers and subdrivers depicts 
the interdependencies of actions to one another .

Resilient CalgaryHOW TO READ THE STRATEGY Action template structure

Action 5A.1   Deliver a Calgary Foresight Planning Method

Why Is This Important?

For our cities to be leaders in the future, we need to make decisions now 
about where we want to go and how we are planning to get there . To 
accomplish this, City services need the tools and resources to innovate 
for cities to survive and thrive in an ever-changing world . Service 
owners will increasingly need to integrate long-term evidence into their 
decision-making processes .
What Will We Do?
To support this process, a coordinated set of foresight activities and partnerships will 
be developed for City service owners to think about the future of Calgary and to inform 
their actions going forward .
How Will We Do This?
We will work with experts who have set up strategic foresight units in different orders of 
governments to develop a service model that is relevant for The City of Calgary .

Resilient Calgary Overview 

Globally, cities are evolving with a future that is increasingly volatile, 
uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA). If we want Calgary to have 
a resilient and prosperous future, we will benefit from better tools to 
engage with and consider numerous complex choices.
The resilience of a city improves when thoughtful, practical and creative tools are used to support our decision-
making capabilities. It involves work that will: reveal novel ideas, challenge existing assumptions about the 
future, and explore the interactions between future trends and the forces driving change.
By adapting, engaging and innovating, Calgary can lead into the future. It will attract employment, stimulate 
local economies and create future sustainability and inclusion.
This shared theme details three specific actions our future-focused city can undertake: 

 S.1 
Deliver a Calgary  
Foresight Planning Method

 S.2 
Use a Resilience 
Dividend Tool

 S.2 
Review the  
Triple Bottom  
Line Policy

This shared theme reflects the needs that have emerged across all of 
the pillars and the tools here will support resilience decision-making 
throughout all of the actions listed in the strategy.

“ Designing the future shape of the city can be a discipline practiced by many, rather than 
an art mastered by few.”

Resilient CalgaryCommunity Mental Health and Addiction Strategy 

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.1)

Mental health and addiction issues affect all 
Calgarians. Recent increases in overdose deaths from 
opioid use in particular have led to an increased 
sense of urgency to address issues of mental health 
and addiction in the community. Deaths involving 
illicit fentanyl have increased dramatically in Calgary 
over the past several years:
•  An average of four Calgarians die every week 

from a suspected overdose. 

•  Calgary has the highest rate of deaths due to 

overdose in our province. 

•  Overdose deaths have happened in every  

Calgary community.

In response to increased concern with issues of 
mental health and addiction in the community, 
Calgary City Council passed the Community  
Action on Mental Health and Addiction in  
July 2018 and earmarked $25 million for the 
implementation of the strategy and related 
initiatives over a five-year period (2019-2023).  
In 2019, the first $3 million in one-time funding 
was granted to 19 non-profit organizations offering 
programs aimed at promotion, early intervention 
and targeted intervention as it relates to mental 
health and addiction.

The City of Calgary has been selected as one of 10 
international cities to participate in the Bloomberg 
Harvard City Leadership Initiative for the 2018-
2019 year, and the development of the Community 
Mental Health and Addiction Strategy has been 
chosen as the focus of Calgary’s involvement. 
The program aims to strengthen cross-boundary 
collaboration through an intensive program to 
develop collaboration among key stakeholders, 
and ongoing team coaching sessions. Through 
membership in the program, Calgary has access to 
Harvard faculty members as resources to support 
effective collaboration and strategy development. 
The City is currently working with key stakeholders 
to establish a governance framework and engage 
further with stakeholders and the community  
on issues of mental health and addiction in  
Calgary. Next steps include identifying initial  
policy directions, strategic actions, targets and 
measures for a Community Mental Health and 
Addiction Strategy.

Resilient CalgaryAction S.1:  Deliver a Calgary Foresight Planning Method

Why Is This Important?

For our cities to be leaders in the future, we need to make decisions now 
about where we want to go and how we plan to get there. To accomplish 
this, City services need future-focused information, tools and resources to 
innovate for cities to survive and thrive in an ever-changing world. Service 
owners will increasingly need to integrate long-term evidence into their 
decision-making processes.
What Will We Do?
To support this process, a coordinated set of foresight activities and partnerships will be 
developed for City service owners to think about the future of Calgary and to inform their 
actions forward.

How Will We Do This?
We will work with experts who have set up strategic foresight units in different orders of 
governments to develop a service model that is relevant for The City of Calgary.

Resilient CalgaryAction S.2:  Use a Resilience Dividend Tool

Why Is This Important?

A Resilience Dividend Tool can guide investment prioritization by 
quantifying the expected impacts from opportunities that make our City 
more resilient. This project may have cross-stakeholder benefits that are 
hard to compare. A valuation of expected benefits helps make decision-
making easier.
In late 2017, Calgary was one of 10 cities in the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) network 
selected to pilot a second wave of the City Resilience Index (CRI). The CRI is a diagnostic 
self-assessment tool developed by consulting firm Arup to conduct a comprehensive 
measurement of cities’ resilience, based on a set list of indicators. The CRI aligns with the 
City Resilience Framework (CRF), a tool that was central to the development of Calgary’s 
resilience strategy.
Throughout 2018, Calgary coordinated with internal and external stakeholders to pilot 
the CRI. Stakeholders included representatives from City of Calgary business units, Civic 
Partners, other levels of government, non-profit organizations, the private sector and 
energy utilities. The process proved beneficial in socializing Calgary’s resilience efforts, 
and the data collected allowed Calgary to produce a resilience profile, revealing the city’s 
strengths and weaknesses. This provides a baseline against which future progress can be 
measured. To date, Calgary is the first city in Canada to complete the CRI assessment.

What Will We Do?
100RC has begun exploring Resilience Dividend Models. We hope to operationalize this 
work following the learnings from their process.

How Will We Do This?
We will build from lessons learned and reference materials to develop a Resilience 
Dividend tool. This tool may be used to prioritize opportunities or estimate resilience 
potential. As an example, if applied to vertical farming scenario, that could include 
measuring the impact on food security, low carbon investment, skill development, 
inclusion of New Canadians in the workforce and the strengthening of food security and 
our innovation ecosystem.

Resilient CalgaryRealizing the Resilience Dividend:  
New Central Library 

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.2)

The community area known as East Village was 
formerly one of Calgary’s most underdeveloped 
districts and its reputation as such left it unable 
to attract private investment. In response to this, 
the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation (CMLC) 
was formed in 2007. Its mandate was to transform 
the Rivers District starting with East Village into a 
vibrant, mixed-use, creative city neighbourhood. 
Since that time, several large investments in the area 
have been made, including building the RiverWalk, 
revitalizing St. Patrick’s Island and constructing the 
recently completed and globally renowned new 
Central Library. 
Twelve years later East Village is now a cultural hub, 
bringing Calgarians together for concerts, markets, 
restaurants and culture. The village is now a jewel of 
the core, home to more than 1,200 new condos and 
over 3,500 residents, a variety of retail options and 
restored heritage buildings. 
Completed in 2018 and providing 240,000 sq. ft. of 
functional, flexible and beautifully designed space, 
the new Central Library hosts a physical collection 
of 450,000 books, 30 free community meeting 
areas, a tech training centre, a performance hall, 
café, outdoor plazas, a children’s library, dedicated 
spaces for teens, and recording studios. Featured 
in the New York Times’ “52 Places to Travel” in 2019, 
the Central Library received more than half a million 
visitors in the first three months (CMLC, 2018).
The library also introduced Indigenous Placemaking, 
a welcoming environment where Indigenous 

people can see their culture reflected and visitors 
can learn about the original inhabitants of the 
land. More Indigenous language resources, and 
programming that preserves Indigenous culture and 
heritage will be available at the library with their 
Indigenous Languages Resource Centre. This project 
is launching at the same time the United Nations 
declared 2019 as the Year of Indigenous Languages.
In 2018, City Council adopted “Calgary in the New 
Economy”, the economic strategy for Calgary. The 
strategy identified four key areas of focus (Talent, 
Innovation, Place and Business Environment) 
targeted at turning the City’s vision for the future 
economy into reality. The overarching goal of the 
Place focus area is to make Calgary a more attractive 
place to live, work and play which should result in 
the city, and downtown, being able to attract new 
employers, young professionals and top talent 
as well as enticing organizations already here 
to grow and expand locally. Developing place is 
achieved through key initiatives that a) accelerate 
urbanization and connectivity in the Core b) expand 
and enhance tourism, cultural and recreational 
assets and c) actively support diversity and inclusion. 
The success of the vision of East Village and its 
flagship destination of the new Central Library 
demonstrates the resilience dividend that can be 
achieved through visionary place making. With the 
simple vision, “To Inspire All”, the new Central Library 
embodies that sense of place, a place where we all 
belong. A destination for Calgarians and tourists 
alike to be inspired, to learn and dream.

Resilient CalgaryAction S.3:  Review the Triple Bottom Line Policy 

Why Is This Important?

The Triple Bottom Line (TBL) Council Policy (2005) serves as The City’s primary 
sustainability policy. Its intent is to bring the social, environmental and economic aspects 
into the decision-making at The City. When the TBL Policy was created, it signaled an 
important commitment making decisions based not only on an economic “bottom 
line” but rather on the triple bottom line that includes social and environmental 
considerations. Since the TBL was created the City has advanced in its understanding 
and application of sustainability in decision-making; however, robust analysis, 
implementation and reporting remains uneven. The Policy review provides a timely 
opportunity to deliver clarity and coordination to the many related policies and strategies 
at The City. This includes further strengthening the relationship between resilience efforts 
including the resilience dividend tool, and long-term sustainability outcomes.

What Will We Do?
Calgary Growth Strategies is conducting a TBL Policy review in collaboration with 
other City Business Units to make it more aligned with The City’s current policy and 
implementation context. Scope of the review will include a proposed updated policy, 
as well as an Implementation Plan. The updated Policy will serve to maintain the 
commitment to sustainability, provide clarity to the policy landscape, and further enable 
implementation across The Corporation. 

How Will We Do This?
Collaboration with sustainability champions and other relevant policy leads to develop 
proposed Policy and Implementation Plan scope to be brought forward to City’s Priority 
and Finance Committee and Council for endorsement. Review will also include formal 
consultation with members of Council.

Resilient CalgaryIntegrating Resilience into Municipal Government:  
One Calgary 2019-2022 Service Plans and Budgets

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.3)

The City of Calgary conducts four-year service 
plans and budgets. This work is based on three 
conversations between the Community, Council and 
Administration.
Vision: What the Community wants as long-term 
quality of life conditions for Calgary, and Council’s 
leadership role in defining The City’s contribution to 
this vision.
Strategy: What Council asks Administration to 
deliver over the four years, and how Administration 
will respond.
Value: How Administration will ensure the 
Community receives value through the services 
delivered by The City.
While developing the four-year service plans 
and budgets, resilience was an intentional 
lens considered by all three members of the 
conversation. This was a natural topic based on 
our collective awareness of the stresses and shocks 
our community had recently faced: a structural 
economic downturn, access to funding to support 
long-term plans, the 2013 flood, recent wind and 
snow events.
Intentionally, the resilience team supported the 
organization through specific engagement in 
lifting awareness of stresses and shocks, training 
colleagues in resilience thinking using the resilience 

lens, strategic foresight and the City Resilience 
Framework. Resilience thinking — identifying co-
benefits, co-creating solutions, and considering the 
resilience dividend of efforts — was integrated into 
our conversations with the community, with Council, 
and with colleagues and stakeholders in building 
the plan. Specific consideration of our Economic 
Strategy, Climate Resilience Strategy, Municipal 
Development Plan and Long Range transportation 
plan were specifically considered while 
Administration prepared the recommendations for 
Council’s consideration, fostered through a step-
by-step dialogue between our community, our 
colleagues and our Council over the course of 2018.

Resilient Calgary Overview 

The resilience of a city improves when all are encouraged and able 
to participate in a diverse and strong economy. This enhances the 
community’s ability to attract business, talent and investment. Calgary 
can capitalize on its high quality of life, available commercial real-estate 
and educated workforce as it continues to bounce back from the recent 
economic downturn. The community is engaged with local businesses, 
other orders of government and City partners cooperating and 
exploring opportunities to build a resilient economy. The importance 
of becoming a more economically resilient city is increasingly urgent. 
Our efforts undertaken developing the Preliminary Resilience Assessment as well as learnings from the economic 
collaboration circle showed considerable vulnerability to the long-term stresses of economic uncertainty, 
inequality and lack of social cohesion, lack of economic diversification, and increased unemployment and 
poverty rates. Many of these stresses can be amplified with exposure to the key shocks identified in our work 
including, financial and economic crisis, cyber-attacks and extreme weather incidents.

Pillar 1 The Future of Calgary's Economy

41

Resilient CalgaryWe are working towards ensuring Calgary’s workforce 
is ready for emerging economies. To support 
underemployed Calgarians develop the skills to 
participate in emerging economies, we are building 
an education ecosystem that reflects the needs of 
industry and is resilient (flexible, robust, integrated 
and inclusive).
Meaningful participation in civic life and emerging 
economies is increasingly dependent on being 
connected. Reducing digital disparity is key to 
achieving economic outcomes. We are working to 
develop a digital disparity study to identify barriers 
to digital participation due to access, hardware, 
literacy and lack of infrastructure. A commitment to 
safe and equitable access strengthens the business 
case for digital infrastructure enabling Calgarians 
to fully participate in the economy and society. Our 
city can also strengthen resilience through business 
continuity. Small/midsize businesses and non-profit 
organizations contribute to Calgary’s economy and 
vibrant communities. However, they are vulnerable 
groups who have limited resources to deal with 
prolonged shocks. Our economic resiliency improves 
when these groups are prepared to survive and thrive 
during and after disruptions. Finally, Calgary must take 
steps to coordinate efficiencies and incentives to grow 
and attract business. Working with 100RC Platform 
Partners, we are encouraging market development 
while strengthening resilient outcomes. Developing a 
Resilience Dividend tool will allow The City to evaluate 
business development opportunities ensuring that 
investments accelerate a resilient city. This will help 
entrepreneurs bring big ideas to fruition, support 
investment in our local economy and make Calgary 
more business friendly. 

 Value Proposition

 •   Immediate opportunity to identify and implement 

economic strategies. 

•   Collaborative approach to explore Economic 
Strategy outcomes within The City and with 
external partners. 

Our Journey

In 2018, City Council unanimously adopted Calgary 
in the New Economy, an economic strategy whose 
implementation will be led by Calgary Economic 
Development (CED) in partnership with The City. 
Along with the Preliminary Resilience Assessment 
(PRA), the document guided the four key outcomes of 
the Economic Strategy. 
We launched a collaboration circle to bring economic 
thought leaders, industry and Calgarians together to 
understand the economic issues and opportunities 
facing our City. We met regularly to develop outcome 
leads and implementation teams while continuing to 
refine our actions. The resilience team also participated 
in the development of other strategies and plans 
including the Economic Strategy, Centre City refresh 
and One Calgary. This allowed for the cross-pollination 
of ideas and actions. In Partnership with CED and 
other partners, the resilience team also participated 
in industry round tables and focus groups to better 
understand the economic issues facing our city.

Resilient CalgaryCalgary Economic Development

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.4)

Calgary’s success depends upon our ability to adapt to the technological advances that are disrupting our 
core industries. Calgary Economic Development is incorporating a variety of initiatives to support workforce 
transition to meet the needs of the digital economy and support the Economic Strategy. Calgary’s Tech 
Talent Accelerator is a collaboration with post-secondary and training institutions to provide short-term 
skill development programs that address immediate business needs. The Digital Skills Mapping Platform is 
designed to transition displaced professionals from the Oil and Gas sector to in-demand opportunities in 
technology across all sectors, as the demand for tech talent in Calgary has increased by 35 per cent in the 
past three years. Calgary Economic Development is also working collaboratively with training and post-
secondary institutions to increase programming with work-integrated learning models to ensure quicker 
employment opportunities at program completion. A Digital Academy model is being developed that can 
be utilized by companies and service providers to create an awareness of technology, and to increase the 
digital literacy of its workforce. 

 OUTCOME 1A: 

Calgary’s workforce is ready for emerging economies
Description: In support of underemployed Calgarians developing the skills needed to 
participate in emerging economies (including the tech industry), we are working on activities 
towards an education ecosystem that reflects the needs of industry and is resilient (flexible, 
robust, integrated and inclusive).

Pillar 1 The Future of Calgary's Economy

43

Resilient CalgaryACTION 1A.1:  Develop Talent for Emerging Economies

Why Is This Important?

Calgary has an employment gap within emerging economies. The tech 
sector is experiencing growth and technology is rapidly permeating all 
sectors of the economy. With digital technology scaling quickly in the city, 
the potential transition of workers into digital occupations across Calgary 
can prove to be mutually beneficial for both job seekers and businesses 
(2018, Cutean, A., Davidson, R.). There is also the need for strengthened 
collaboration with post-secondary and training institutions to provide 
short-term skill development programs that address immediate business 
needs. A resilient economy is one that encourages all to find meaningful 
opportunities to participate. As we work towards inclusiveness, our 
economy also benefits from greater participation from underutilized and 
untapped talent within equity-seeking communities.
What Will We Do?
Calgary Economic Development leads efforts to: 
•  Develop and maintain an online tool to connect job seekers with current employment 

opportunities and the skills training opportunities. 

•  Collaborate between Calgary Economic Development, industry and educators (e.g. 

post-secondary institutions) to create skill-development programs that address 
immediate industry needs.

•  Develop accessible opportunities that encourage gender and cultural diversity in our 

emerging technology sector. 

How Will We Do This?
In alignment with the Economic Development Strategy, continue to implement strategies 
that include: 
•  Expand experiential learning programs.
•  CED, alongside employers and training providers has built an online platform that hosts 

job posting and training opportunities https://www.calgaryupskill.ca/ 

•  Collaborate with post-secondary institutions and other educators to pilot and scale 

nimble, short-form programs (three- to six-month certificates) that address immediate 
business needs.

•  Offer appropriate networking and recruiting opportunities to ensure graduates obtain 

competitive jobs.

•  Explore opportunities to deliver courses downtown.
•  Ensure programs are accessible and tailored to equity-seeking communities.
•  Focus talent recruitment activities to attract women and diverse employees into 

leadership positions.

Resilient CalgaryCalgary Welcomes Emerging Economies

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.5)

Calgary is evolving toward a future of technological 
change, digital dominance, automated intelligence 
and innovative solutions to complex issues. Our 
Mayor and Calgary City Council have kept a watchful 
eye on this new future and its deep ties to a robust 
and thriving economy for our city. To remain vibrant 
and resilient, our economy will demand the skills 
and talents of people who are educated and trained 
to thrive in these emerging industries and sectors.
Along with Council,  Calgary’s mayor, Naheed 
Nenshi plays a significant role in efforts to attract 
new talent to our city. As the first Muslim mayor of a 
major North American city and winner of the World 
Mayor Prize in 2014, he epitomizes the changing 
demographics of our province, and how people 
from all walks of life can succeed here in whatever 
field they wish to pursue. It is hard to find someone 
who does a better job selling Calgary to potential 
investors, to companies looking to set up offices 
here, and to people looking for a great place to 
make a living and make a life. 
In October 2018, Mayor Nenshi accompanied 
Calgary Economic Development to Vancouver to 

sell Calgary’s tech industry. While all of the attention 
has been on employment challenges in the oil 
and gas sector, opportunities in the tech sector 
have grown by nearly 55% in Calgary and many 
companies are having a hard time finding the talent 
they need to expand. Filling these jobs (there are 
currently more than 1900 vacancies in the sector) is 
crucial to diversifying our economy and making it 
more resilient. Mayor Nenshi spoke to a room full of 
Vancouver-based tech firms about the lower cost of 
doing business here and the quality of life awaiting 
their employees on the other side of the Rockies. He 
also attended a job fair for tech workers where he 
highlighted the affordability of housing and shorter 
commute times. Similar missions to international 
cities are being planned for later in 2019 and 
through 2020. 
Calgary Economic Development has also been 
working with the company VanHack to help connect 
employers here in Calgary with tech talent from 
around the world. As Mayor Nenshi asserts, “It’s not 
hard to make the case for Calgary, we just need to 
make sure the world hears our story”.

our economic outcomes. We have been working to develop a digital disparity study that 
would identify barriers to digital participation due to access, hardware, literacy and lack of 
infrastructure. A commitment to safe and equitable access strengthens the business case  
for digital infrastructure enabling citizens and businesses to fully participate in the economy

Resilient CalgaryACTION 1B.1:  Understand Digital Disparity

Why Is This Important?

Online access is a necessity to fully participate in the economy and society 
though one that comes with risks and exclusions. Equitable, safe and 
secure online access is a necessity for meaningful economic and social 
participation in Calgary. Deficiencies in digital literacy, network access 
and affordability are barriers that reduce the participation capacity  
for Calgarians.
What Will We Do?
Completing a study of the connectivity barriers of Calgarians will guide the 
implementation of support programs that address issues including, access, digital literacy 
and affordability. 
Adopting the Cities for Digital Rights declaration and its principles for safe and inclusive 
online access will guide the development of actions to advance Resilient Calgary, Smart 
City and Living Lab strategies. This will also set the expectation that the right of safe 
online access is as important to quality of life, meeting basic needs, and full participation 
in our city as other critical infrastructure.

How Will We Do This?
In partnership with the University of Calgary and community partners, we will conduct 
research to better understand those most impacted by the lack of digital literacy, 
affordability and lack of digital infrastructure to connect online.
We will work with other Cities for Digital Rights signatories to understand the 
requirements of become a member and work to integrate Digital Bill of Rights into 
community and infrastructure strategies.

Resilient CalgaryAction 1B.2:  Be 5G-Ready

Why Is This Important?

For our city to be future-ready, policy, investment and infrastructure need 
to be in place for digital access (5G/small cell) that improves our ability 
to meet the growing need to move information over communication 
networks quickly and reliably. Beyond the provision of cellular and 
Wi-Fi services, 5G is going to play an important role in igniting the 
digital economy as it has the potential to enable and accelerate new 
innovations forward such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), field 
sensors, Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Connected Vehicles (CV), vehicle 
entertainment systems, and intelligent traffic systems.
What Will We Do?
Ensuring equal access to municipal infrastructure with multiple purposes will support the 
deployment of small cell antennae required for 5G. The development of new standards for 
attachments to City assets and new municipal processes will reduce deployment barriers 
while still maintaining municipal approval processes. Integrating these new standards and 
processes into future municipal growth planning will ensure Calgary has a sustainable 
plan long into the future.

How Will We Do This?
A digital infrastructure strategy will be developed to accelerate the eventual deployment 
of thousands of small cell antennas over the next 10 years. A Proof of Concept (POC) 
in cooperation with three large carriers will determine the requirements, validate 
processes, establish new standards and agreements. Lastly, we will develop business 
models to ensure compliance with regulation and legislation while developing revenue 
opportunities on digital assets.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 1C: 

Strengthening resilience through business continuity
Description: We are working with business, emergency response and business  
continuity leaders to leverage their expertise in disaster preparation and recovery to 
strengthen the resiliency of our business and non-profit sector in their preparation for planned  
and unplanned disruptions.

Action 1C.1:  Support  Business Continuity Planning

Why Is This Important?

Calgarians depend on the business and service providers to meet our 
everyday needs. This is even more important during times of crisis though 
fewer than 45 per cent of Calgary businesses have developed a business 
continuity plan to address disruption. Community partners’ efforts help 
to raise awareness of the risks and make available the tools to assess and 
strengthen readiness for disaster and disruption. 
Learnings from the 2013 flood response and recovery efforts and 
other large infrastructure projects have shown considerable impact 
on economic corridors especially when these disruptions impact small 
business. We have also seen the positive impact coordinated efforts can 
have on helping these businesses survive and thrive through disruption.
What Will We Do?
With our partners, we aim to:
•  Raise awareness and understanding of the importance of business continuity planning.
•  Encourage organizations to evaluate their own disaster preparedness.
•  Promote undertaking actions needed to be better prepared for disruption.
•  Work to reduce the negative impact of disruption on adjacent businesses/communities 

during long-term construction.

How Will We Do This?
Collaborating with community leaders in business continuity and partners like the 
Chamber of Commerce, CARYA and the Calgary Emergency Management Agency, we will 
share learnings and opportunities to strengthen business continuity of Calgary Businesses 
and non-profit sector. We will also conduct research on best practices from other 
jurisdictions for business support programs. We will utilize this research to develop a 
business support strategy and tool box that can be used for future infrastructure projects.

Resilient CalgaryReady Calgary

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.6)

Calgary is a community known by its location in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and proximity 
to the Bow and Elbow rivers. While these natural elements provide a beautiful backdrop to live, work 
and play, they also contribute to severe weather and create other natural hazards like flooding. In fact, 
Calgary has experienced five of the 10 costliest disasters in Canadian history. In addition to making our 
City systems, plans and critical infrastructure more emergency-proof, a critical component of increasing 
Calgary’s resilience to disaster is the role the community must play in preparing themselves for the kinds of 
emergencies we are likely to experience here.
Through its flagship “Ready Calgary” program, The Calgary Emergency Management Agency has been 
actively educating and training Calgarians to do just that. Aimed at individuals, families, businesses and 
communities, Ready Calgary uses community events, online and in-person courses/training, partnerships, 
volunteer recruitment and campaigns to help Calgarians help themselves be more prepared. To learn more,

Resilient CalgaryGlobal Network for Advanced Management

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.7)

The City of Calgary partnered with 100 Resilient 
Cities (100RC) and the Global Network for 
Advanced Management (GNAM) to host a global, 
online project for urban resilience during the fall 
semester of 2018. For four months The City worked 
with graduate students from the University of 
British Columbia (Canada) and Yale SOM (USA) 
to explore international examples of business 
support programs adjacent to large infrastructure 
projects. The final project report found that 

transportation agencies, local governments and 
business associations have used a wide variety of 
mitigation tactics to reduce construction impacts 
on businesses. Common tactics include access 
management strategies, marketing and signage, and 
community outreach. Less common, but potentially 
very effective strategies include business consulting 
programs, financial support programs (loans, grants 
etc.), and procurement strategies (2018, Li et al). 

 OUTCOME 1D: 

Calgary is able to coordinate efficiencies, levers and incentives to grow and 
attract business
Description: We are bringing together various business attraction stakeholders to explore 
the tools available to encourage market development while strengthening resilient outcomes. 
We have also been working closely with our Smart City and Living Lab teams to identify 
opportunities to leverage underutilized City assets to accelerate growth in the innovation 
ecosystem. Our Living Lab efforts support increased economic diversification and jobs for 
Calgarians. It will help entrepreneurs bring big ideas to fruition, support investment in our 
local economy and make Calgary more business friendly. By revisiting our 10-year Centre 
City strategy, we are able to strengthen the resilience of our downtown core with a vision 
for the Centre City along with strategies and actions for community planning, urban design, 
governance, economic, cultural and social development.

Resilient CalgaryAction 1D.1:  Attraction, Growth and Resilience Dividend

Why Is This Important?

Business development is a vital part of a resilient economy, as such, there 
are many market attraction efforts underway in our city. Development 
and growth opportunities should be strategic and consider a resilience 
dividend that allows for a better understanding of short- and long-term 
benefits from across the City Resilience Framework, whether they are 
economic, social or environmental. Like infrastructure investments, 
economic investments should look to meet strategic long-term needs. 
This understanding will improve the business case for investment 
opportunities and ensure the capital outlay does not put the community 
resiliency at risk in the future.
“As the world becomes more connected and complex, so do business activities. 
From startups to mature enterprises, Calgary aims to create a more business-friendly 
environment in order to attract and retain companies.”(2018, Calgary in the New Economy, 
CED) 

What Will We Do?
Coordinate market incentives and business supports to grow and attract business with 
a focus on opportunities that strengthen our city’s resilience or ability to meet needs 
during shocks and stresses (e.g. affordable housing, health, climate change or economic 
downturns). 

How Will We Do This?
Working with a 100RC Platform Partner and community stakeholders, we are developing 
a Resilience Dividend tool to prioritize opportunities and calculate resilience potential. 
As an example, for a vertical farming partner, that could include measuring the impact of 
low carbon investment, skill development along with the strengthening of food security 
and our innovation ecosystem. This tool can guide investment prioritization and develop 
thresholds that trigger specific attraction strategies. This could build on the outcomes 
within Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund to quantify the expected impacts from 
opportunities that make our City more resilient, particularly on aspects beyond primary 
economic benefits.

Resilient CalgaryCalgary Dollars Creates Economic Resilience

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.8)

Calgary Dollars, our community currency, utilizes a 
cash alternative to keep the local economy flowing 
between neighbours and businesses. Created in 
1996 and funded by The City of Calgary Family & 
Community Support Services (FCSS) since 2003, 
Calgary Dollars works to advance the interests of 
small businesses and equity-seeking communities.
Aligned with the Enough For All Strategy, 
the Economic Development Strategy and 
imagineCalgary, Calgary Dollars has also 
collaborated with 100RC and other global cities with 
complementary currency pilots.

Economic Resilience for Equity-Seeking Communities 
December 7, 2018 saw the launch of the digital 
version of Calgary Dollars to circulate along with 
the printed currency. The launch was celebrated 
by the President of The Calgary Housing Company, 
the Alberta Finance Minister and the Victoria Park 
Business Improvement Area Executive Director. 
The Calgary Housing Company is now accepting 
Calgary Dollars as part of rent in a pilot with four 
other affordable housing agencies, while The City 
of Calgary accepts Calgary Dollars for transit tickets, 
and 50 per cent of business license fees.

The Alberta Minister of Community and Social 
Services endorsed Calgary Dollars as beneficial for 
secured income and the Assured Income for the 
Severely Handicapped (AISH) recipients, with the 
Annual Calgary Dollars outcome measurement has 
both the social and economic capital evidence to 
back that up.
Social capital: 
•  67 per cent of Calgary Dollars users state they 
have established relationships of trust due to 
participation. 

•  73 per cent state they have someone that would 
help them during challenging times as a result of 
their involvement with Calgary Dollars.

•  70 per cent state that Calgary Dollars has 

increased their involvement in their community. 

Economic capital:
•  79 per cent have been encouraged to buy  

more locally.

•  48 per cent agree that after using Calgary Dollars 

they are more able to live within their means.

•  54 per cent don’t worry about money as much 

after being in the Calgary Dollars program. 

As Calgary’s Mayor Nenshi affirms, “complementary 
currencies can make a huge difference as we build 
communities together.”

As a key stakeholder in a thriving innovation ecosystem, we are supporting the 
development of a Living Lab Strategy, opening up City assets to companies, researchers 
and individuals to test and try ideas and products in a real-life environment. 

How Will We Do This?
With our partners, we will endeavor to:
•  Understand what assets have Living Lab capacity and potential
•  Develop criteria for Living Lab opportunities
•  Develop an intake process to review and implement opportunities

Resilient CalgaryPoint Trotter Autonomous Systems Drone Flight Area 

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.9)

Point Trotter Autonomous Systems Drone Flight 
Area opened in October 2018 and provides Calgary 
businesses, industry and researchers with a low-
cost and accessible place for drones, autonomous 
vehicles or the next big innovation.
With 125 acres of land available, Calgary is one 
of the first major cities in North America to offer 
land for the mass flying of commercial drones on 
municipal-owned land. The Point Trotter project is 
part of the Living Lab strategy where The City of 
Calgary and Calgary Economic Development are 
working with the community to make public spaces, 
transportation corridors and land more accessible 
for the testing of technological innovation.
The idea of providing City-owned space for aerial 
drone testing started in 2017 when City staff looked 
at many emerging technologies, related societal 
trends, and what they could mean for the future of 
Calgary. Point Trotter Autonomous Systems Drone 
Flight Area was developed to support innovation, 

the tech ecosystem and local businesses, which is 
one of the ways The City of Calgary is delivering on 
its business-friendly promise.
“Point Trotter Autonomous Systems Drone Flight 
Area is a great example of how The City of Calgary 
is working with our community partners to support 
innovation and allow entrepreneurs to bring their 
big ideas to fruition,” says Mayor Nenshi. 
 “We’re committed to supporting investment in our 
economy and making Calgary more innovative and 
business friendly.”
Point Trotter ASTA is a valuable asset to add to 
The City’s Living Lab initiative. The City is working 
with Calgary Economic Development to deliver a 
simplified process for users and producers to gain 
access to infrastructure (physical, digital and data) 
like the Point Trotter industrial park to test and try 
ideas and products in a real-life environment that is 
safe and secure.

Resilient Calgary Action 1D.3:  The Future of Calgary’s Centre City

Why Is This Important?

The Centre City Plan for Calgary’s downtown area was approved by 
Council in 2007. The Centre City is made up of the downtown commercial 
core and is surrounded by five mixed-use neighbourhoods that function 
as a symbiotic whole. The plan is a coordinated strategy document that 
pulls together the vision for the Centre City along with strategies and 
actions relating to community planning, urban design, governance, 
economic, cultural and social development. The plan is undergoing its 
10-year update to develop a current vision for the downtown to support 
its resilience as it undergoes a major transformation in response to 
a dramatic change in the downtown economy that has resulted in a 
significant drop in economic activity and jobs. This has impacted its social 
and economic environment and proposes challenges to ensuring its 
continued livability and role as the cultural heart of the city.
What Will We Do?
We will consult upfront with external stakeholders to understand their needs and wants 
and gather their suggestions. We will then propose a 10-year strategic plan that identifies 
actions that will drive us toward the vision.

How Will We Do This?
Extensive external engagement and intensive internal collaboration to ensure the actions 
are achievable. An accountability system will be identified that will steward the strategy 
on a regular basis and include regular updates to Council.

Inclusive Futures 

 GOAL 
Institutions have trusted and informed 
relationships with Calgary’s equity-seeking 
communities.

Pillar 2 Inclusive Futures

58

Resilient Calgary  Overview

The resilience of a city improves when:
•  Equity-seeking communities (escs) are regarded as strengths to society and have meaningful voices in 

decision-making and leadership. 

•  Communities are connected and feel empowered to act.
•  Power is distributed fairly in our systems. 
•  Differing opinions that challenge our thinking are valued and accepted. 
Communities and various sector partners agreed that a key resilience challenge in Calgary was the lack of 
inclusion in leadership and decision-making. One reason for this was that institutions did not trust the expertise 
and experiences that ESCs brought to the decision-making and leadership tables. The best way forward was for 
Calgary institutions to recognize these strengths and focus on building trusted relationships with ESCs. 
We identified four outcomes and nine actions to advance this work. They are: 

 Outcome 2A 
Calgary institutions 
include ESCs in decision-
making and democratic 
processes
Action 2A.1  
Diversify representation  
on boards
Action 2A.2  
Open spaces for inclusive 
conversations
Action 2A.3  
Advance equity in 
organizations with a  
multi-sectoral community 
of practice

 Outcome 2B 
Calgary institutions 
have trusted and 
informed relationships 
with Indigenous 
communities in a 
“good way”
Action 2B.1  
Support to revitalize 
Indigenous cultures  
and languages
Action 2B.2  
Walk parallel paths 
together

 Outcome 2C 
Calgary institutions 
value diverse 
governance paradigms
Action 2C.1  
Build a governance 
systems map

 Outcome 2D 
Calgary institutions 
invest in equitable 
economic 
development
Action 2D.1  
Encourage business 
investments addressing 
inclusion
Action 2D.2  
Develop a social 
procurement policy
Action 2D.3  
Explore guaranteed 
basic income options

 Linkage to other Resilient Calgary Pillars

When we work together to achieve these outcomes, ESCs will be respected as critical human assets needed to 
build a future-focused city. ESCs will be able to meaningfully participate in innovative and creative solutions to 
Calgary’s economic, natural infrastructure, and infrastructure resilience challenges. 

  Value Proposition

There are many institutions and strategies currently tackling social issues in Calgary (see Appendix 3: Strategic 
Alignments). What makes this pillar unique is the focus on the institutions’ role in building trusted relationships 
with ESCs, using a human-assets perspective (rather than a vulnerable-populations perspective). This pillar aims 
to use a systems-change approach where communities and institutions collectively work together with a future-
focused lens to build a more resilient Calgary.

Resilient Calgary Our Journey

We live in a city of diverse people and communities. A vibrant place where people of different identities live, 
work and play. Local trends forecast that immigration will be Calgary’s main driver of population growth 
until 2036. Urban Indigenous Peoples, seniors and racialized people represent fast-growing segments of our 
population. Our demographics from 2016 Statistics Canada show that Calgary has:

Families

In February 2018, Calgary’s Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment (PRA) identified a significant resilience 
issue — we as Calgary institutions see equity-seeking 
communities (ESCs) as vulnerable and dependent. 
We assume that these communities require help to 
change so they can integrate into society. 

The evidence that we use to support this is: 
•  Lower rates of civic participation
•  Higher rates of poverty
•  Higher rates of  un/under-employment
•  Lower wages
•  Lack of representation in leadership
•  Countless stories of racism and discrimination

When we have a perspective that emphasizes only vulnerability and 
need, it fails to account for the wealth of talent, experience, and energy 
that ESCs bring to Calgary. By leveraging the untapped strengths of 
ESCs, Calgary can forge a resilient path that is creative, innovative and 
responsive in challenging times. The key to make all this happen is trust.

“There is one thing that is common to every individual, relationship, team, family, organization, 
nation, economy, and civilization throughout the world  — one thing which, if removed, will destroy 
the most powerful government, the most successful business, the most thriving economy, the most 
influential leadership, the greatest friendship, the strongest character, the deepest love. On the other 
hand, if developed and leveraged, that one thing has the potential to create unparalleled success 
and prosperity in every dimension of life. Yet, it is the least understood, most neglected, and most 
underestimated possibility of our time. … That one thing is TRUST.” – Stephen M. Covey

Pillar 2 Inclusive Futures

60

Resilient CalgaryWe overwhelmingly heard from our ESCs that good 
relationships are a two-way street. However, they 
believed that most of the responsibilities fell on 
them to build those relationships with institutions. 
Institutions also have a duty in actively engaging and 
investing in these relationships. 
With trust as our foundation, community and sector 
partners focussed on the active participation by 
institutions to nurture relationships with our ESCs. 
The Inclusion Collaboration Circle (ICC) that led this 
investigation began to explore how institutions can 
meet the expectations and needs for all involved 
parties if Calgary is to be resilient in the face of future 
stresses and shocks. A futures-thinking approach 
built on a strategic foresight method and the FSG 
Conditions of Systems Change framework was used. 
The ICC, co-led by United Way of Calgary and Area, 
included over 60 highly engaged representatives from 
ESCs and major institutions within Calgary (including 
the not-for-profit, private and public sectors). We 
spoke to eight different equity-seeking communities 
and four community expert groups to understand 
the society, technology, economic, environment and 
political (STEEP) trends that could impact relationships. 
Using this information, the ICC imagined four unique 
scenarios of Calgary in 2038. These scenarios helped us 
identify potential bumps in the road and opportunities 
that could impact relationships between institutions 
and ESCs. This process resulted in our commitment  
to achieve four outcomes by collectively working on 
nine actions.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 2A: 

Calgary institutions include equity-seeking communities in decision-making and 
democratic processes 
Description: In the development of this outcome, we heard that Calgary’s equity-seeking 
communities (ESCs) face barriers to meaningful participation in decision-making and 
democratic processes. This is projected to remain a challenge when strengthening of 
relationships between Calgary’s institutions and ESCs in the future. 
ESCs believe that institutions can nurture their 
relationships with ESCs by: 
1.  Including ESCs at the leadership table in  

their institutions.

2.  Intentionally involving ESCs in decision-

making that impacts their lives. 

ESCs want institutions to listen and speak to them 
in ways that make them feel genuinely heard, 
understood and valued. ESCs want institutions 
to create space for debate and challenging 
conversations with honesty, dignity and respect. 
This goes beyond tokenism, advisory committees, 
general consultations and citizen surveys. 
This has “done little to overcome voter apathy in 
elections, a general distrust in government, and 
people’s feelings of disempowerment, particularly among those who are marginalized,” (Wharf, 2016, p. 154). 
Instead, ESCs need institutions to change their policies and practices that prevent them from (1) being in 
influential positions that can impact future change in Calgary; and (2) having meaningful voices in local 
democratic processes. This would be an important step forward for institutions to build trusted and informed 
relationships with ESCs.

Resilient CalgaryAccessible council chambers

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.10)

In 2006, City Council’s Advisory Committee on 
Accessibility (ACA) performed an Accessibility 
Audit on the Municipal Building Complex, resulting 
in a major renovation to the Council Chamber. 
This would allow for Council, Administration and 
members of the public to seamlessly participate  
in the Municipal Government process through  
the creation of an accessible environment for  
people with physical, sensory and cognitive 
disabilities. Funding was secured for the project  
in 2010 and Council Chambers closed that  
summer. The accessibility renovation was completed 
for the swearing-in ceremony for City Council 
October 25, 2010. 
The accessibility improvements have not only 
supported people with disabilities to participate 
in Council Chamber, but it created a space that 
is accessible for Councillors or members of 
Administration with an injury or other disabilities. 
The accessibility upgrades that benefit everyone 
include (1) lowering of the Council Chamber floor 

and removing the existing ramps at the entrances 
to make the room accessible and barrier-free, 
(2) adjusting the seating in the viewing area to 
accommodate six spaces for mobility devices, 
(3) installing a universally accessible podium 
and microphone that adjusts, (4) installing new 
carpeting and stair nosings that provide contrast 
for people with vision loss and (5) adding a few 
bariatric seats throughout the Chamber. The new 
Councilor space also allows an individual to use a 
mobility device with moveable desks that adjust to 
the height required. Two new digital screens at the 
front of Council Chambers allows for captioning to 
be displayed, with typed words that are being said 
for people with hearing loss.
These changes in Council Chamber have led to a 
more inclusive space for people with disabilities in 
Calgary. It has led to their meaningful participation 
in the Municipal Government process and allows 
anyone with a disability to be part of City Council  
or Administration.

Resilient CalgaryAction 2A.1: 

 Diversify Representation on Boards 

Why Is This Important?

We heard from equity-seeking communities (ESCs) that institutions can 
show they trust them by having ESC members on their boards. It is there 
that ESCs can provide their different perspectives based on experiences 
and expertise. 
Governance is the top tier of leadership where ultimate oversight, 
strategic direction and policy are determined. Many reports and experts 
support that fully-trained and inclusive boards are better positioned to 
advance innovation, increase access to different markets, make better 
decisions and achieve results. A board which reflects the diversity of the 
community it serves has more legitimacy in that community and can help 
build networks and relationships to diverse groups.
Many boards recognize that this is important, but struggle with finding 
people from ESCs to sit on their boards. They have asked for help to 
create more inclusive boards for their organizations.
What Will We Do?
We have partnered with Ryerson University to bring a national program called onBoard 
Canada to Calgary. This innovative program works towards diversifying not-for-profit and 
public boards to better represent the populations they serve. 

How Will We Do This?
We initiated this work in March 2019 by co-hosting an event with onBoard Canada. We 
brought together over 50 stakeholders interested in advancing diverse governance. We 
discussed that we will move forward by: 
(1)  Providing online and affordable governance training to both boards and individuals. 

This training embeds the principles of inclusion into their governance processes, 
policies and approaches.

(2)  Bridging the inclusion gap using a board-matching program that connects qualified 

candidates from equity-seeking groups to not-for-profit and public boards. 

(3)  Offering continuous learning and networking opportunities for both boards and 

individuals that dig deeper into issues surrounding governance and inclusion.

Resilient CalgaryAction 2A.2:  Open Spaces for Inclusive Conversations

Why Is This Important?

We heard from equity-seeking communities (ESCs) that a strong, 
healthy democracy benefits from their wisdom, perspectives and 
participation, not only from the same people traditionally involved in 
these conversations. ESCs want us to imagine a city where they can 
participate fully, equally, and meaningfully, including those who have 
been historically excluded. This is essential in finding effective solutions 
to a city’s most complex issues.
What Will We Do?
We will create public spaces and processes where ESCs, organizations and government 
officials can come together to have constructive, respectful, informed and decisive 
conversations about important public issues. These processes would be intentional, 
proactive and accessible to Calgary’s ESCs. 

How Will We Do This?
We will proceed in three ways:
(1)  Create safe and brave spaces: We will look for ways for diversity and free expression to 

(2) 

respectfully co-exist in public spaces and in institutions. It is in these spaces that we 
can deepen our understanding of one another so we can find a way forward.
Implement inclusive communications and public engagement practices: We 
have already begun to develop tools and processes to share information in ways 
that everyone can understand. It means that we need to recognize that people 
understand and express themselves differently.

(3)  Strengthen inclusive marketing: We will create and review content that truly reflects 

the equity-seeking communities that our institutions serve. It means that we will 
elevate diverse voices, decrease biases, and lead positive social change through 
thoughtful and respectful content.

Resilient CalgaryLori’s Story: from shelter to sanctuary  
through affordable housing 

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.11)

Affordable housing is about people. People with 
hopes, needs, dreams and the drive to succeed.
However, with market rental rates among the 
highest in Canada, it’s difficult for some Calgarians 
to pursue their dreams while affording a place to 
live. In fact, nearly one in five Calgary households 
are struggling with shelter costs and over 44,000 
households are at risk of becoming homeless due 
to spending more than 50 per cent of their gross 
income on shelter costs.
Access to safe and stable housing helps create 
inclusive communities and makes our city a great 
place to live and work. People in affordable housing 
have greater chances to find and keep jobs, to learn 
and build skills, and be active participants in their 
communities. And the benefits are clear: Providing 
housing for one homeless person has been shown 
to save taxpayers $34,000 annually.
That’s why The City of Calgary works with all orders 
of government, as well as many Calgary-based 
affordable housing partners and champions like the 
Community Housing Affordability Collective, more 
commonly known as CHAC. 
CHAC is a network of more than 100 organizations 
and citizens who are working to improve housing 
affordability through collaboration and advocacy. 
Together, they are able to see issues from many 
perspectives, helping the sector anticipate and 
adapt to risks nimbly and creatively. 
But our collective work isn’t done. Only 3.6 per cent 
of all housing in Calgary is non-market (affordable) 
housing — nearly half the national average in 
Canada’s other urban centres. To match the national 
average, Calgary will need to build approximately 
15,000 new units. The City of Calgary is committed 
to continue working with government, non-profit 
housing providers, and private sector developers to 
meet that need.

Lori left a difficult relationship, along with her 
son and daughter. It wasn’t easy. Lori and her 
children arrived at a Calgary shelter seeking help. 
Lori applied for assistance with the Calgary 
Housing Company and received an offer of a 
place to live three months later. Today, Lori  
works at a non-profit society, where she uses  
her experience to help other women leaving 
similar circumstances. She is also saving up  
for her forever home. Lori’s kids are thriving, 
getting involved in community activities and 
making friends.

“ We came here with clothes and  
a few stuffies. Now I have this…  
what I call my sanctuary,” says Lori. 
“The best thing about affordable 
housing is looking around in the 
morning with my coffee, and my  
kids aren’t scared.”

Resilient CalgaryAction 2A.3: 

 Advance Equity in Organizations with a Multi-Sectoral 
Community of Practice

Why Is This Important?

For institutions to strengthen their relationships with equity-seeking 
communities (ESCs), they need to acknowledge that not all people start 
off the same. People have different experiences, barriers, backgrounds, 
wants and needs. 
Institutions need opportunities to discuss and better understand where 
ESCs are coming from and give them what they need to be successful. 
This means not necessarily giving everyone the exact same thing, but 
rather giving people the things they need to do well. Improving equity 
involves increasing fairness within services and processes of institutions, 
and in their distribution of resources. It requires an understanding of the 
root causes of outcome disparities within our society and a commitment 
to address those root causes that have led to unfair conditions.
What Will We Do?
We will establish the Calgary’s Equity Foundations Community of Practice, a multi-
sectoral community of practice with members of Calgary’s institutions. We will work 
together to embed equity in our institutions and practices. 

How Will We Do This?
Calgary’s Equity Foundations Community of Practice will participate in the Urban 
Sustainability Directors Network (USDN) Equity Foundations Program. This program will 
support the community of practice’s learning of how to apply an equity lens to our work 
and implement tools to advance equity in our organizations. This will be done by:
(1)  Developing shared language and analysis.
(2)  Learn how to conduct equity impact assessments (a systematic examination of how 

different groups will likely be affected by actions or decisions).

(3)  Support each other to create and implementing plans for integrating equity into our 

organizations.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 2B: 

Calgary institutions have trusted and informed relationships with Indigenous 
communities “in a good way”**
Description: In the development of this outcome, we heard that Calgary’s Indigenous 
communities face barriers in building trust with institutions due to the historical context of 
their relationships. This is projected to remain a challenge when strengthening relationships 
between Calgary’s institutions and Indigenous communities in the future. 
Indigenous communities believe that 
institutions can address some of the historical 
challenges in their relationships through 
institutional support of Indigenous-led and 
prioritized initiatives. They do not want 
institutions to lead their work, but to play 
a supportive ally role in moving their work 
forward. This can be first done by institutions 
actively and deeply listening to what 
Indigenous communities really need from 
Calgary institutions. This process will shift the 
“expertise” towards Indigenous community 
members rather than situating institutions  
as experts. 
This outcome was inspired by The City of Calgary’s Indigenous Policy, United Way of Calgary and Area’s Elders 
Institute, and the University of Calgary’s Indigenous Strategy, called ii’taa’poh’to’p. To move forward, institutions 
will need to examine the relationships and connections that prevent them from having trusting relationships 
with Indigenous communities in a good way.

**“In a good way” is a concept used by many Indigenous peoples to recognize work that is conducted 
in authentic and meaningful ways, with intention and sincerity, through reciprocal and respectful 
relationships. It is a demonstration of working with clear purpose and with high levels of integrity, 
moral strength and communal spirit (University of Calgary, 2018).

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.1)

“ We are all Treaty people. History 
plays an important role in 
reconciliation; to build for the future, 
Canadians must look to, and learn 
from, the past.”
–  Final Report of the Truth & Reconciliation 
Commission, Volume One: Summary 2015

Canada is embarking on a journey of Truth and 
Reconciliation to acknowledge the harmful impact 
of colonization on Indigenous Peoples, and to 
establish a way forward together.
Calgary City Council approved the Indigenous Policy 
in 2017 to provide us with the necessary context 
to understand the complexities and uniqueness 
of our shared history. The policy helps guide and 
inform us about our city’s true and local history, the 
traditional lands we live on and how our work as a 
city continues to impact Indigenous people.
Throughout Resilient Calgary strategy development, 
Indigenous people have shared their thoughts, 
ideas and contributions, and have helped shape 
our strategy actions during our Agenda Setting 
Workshop, our phase 2 launch, in our collaboration 
circles and with our steering committee. They 
have shared their language through prayer and 
blessings as we walk together in our resilience 
work. An Elders meeting on December 13th, 
2018 had representation from four nations of the 
Siksikaitsitapi, Kainai-Blood Tribe, Siksika, Piikani 
and Amskapi Pikuni. The Elders gave their blessing 
to continue with the work to support the inclusion 
of Indigenous people in Moh’kinsstsis, the city of 
Calgary in the planning for the resilience strategy.
Our journey takes another step, together, through 
the release of the Resilient Calgary strategy. 
The inclusion pillar embraces the opportunity 
to continue to build trusting and informed 
relationships with Indigenous communities in a 
good way. This includes creating process and spaces 
for inclusive conversations, and helping to preserve 
Indigenous cultures and languages. This aligns to 
the United Nations 2019 declaration as The Year 
of Indigenous Languages, to acknowledge the 
importance of Indigenous languages worldwide. 
Interconnection is a central belief of many Indigenous 
people. “All my relations” reflects the awareness 
that everything in the universe is connected, has a 
purpose, and is worthy of care and respect.

Resilient CalgaryAction 2B.1: 

 Support the Revitalization of Indigenous  
Cultures and Languages

Why Is This Important?

We heard from Indigenous Elders and community members that 
energy needs to be focused on revitalizing Indigenous languages and 
cultures. They are concerned that their languages and cultures are slowly 
disappearing. As part of building relationships in a good way, they are 
asking Calgary institutions to support their efforts to regain their cultures 
and languages. 
Languages are a core component of human rights and fundamental freedoms. They play 
a crucial role in the daily lives of people, allowing them to preserve their history, customs 
and traditions, memory, unique modes of thinking, meaning and expression, but also to 
construct their future.
Languages play a great role in building inclusive societies. It provides access to 
information and stimulates innovation. Languages contribute to human development, 
and are essential to sustainable development, good governance, peace and 
reconciliation.

What Will We Do?
There are current Indigenous language and culture revitalization activities underway. 
These activities are only the start. Calgary institutions can support this work as informed 
by Calgary’s Indigenous communities.

How Will We Do This?
Building trust with Calgary’s Indigenous Elders, Knowledge Keepers and Peoples is 
essential to this work. We will continue to develop meaningful relationships with many 
Indigenous groups in a good way by actively listening to how they want us to support 
regaining their cultures and languages.

Resilient CalgaryAction 2B.2:  Walk Parallel Paths Together in a “Good Way”

Why Is This Important?

We heard from Indigenous Protocol & Cultural Technicians that there 
are different points of view and ways of knowing. In our shared journey 
with Calgary’s Indigenous communities towards reconciliation, it is up 
to institutions to respect the perspective of others by walking “parallel 
paths” and creating an ethical space for authentic conversations. This can 
lead to the creation of new knowledge based on respectful relations.
What Will We Do?
We will work with Calgary’s Indigenous Elders and Traditional Knowledge Keepers to 
co-create parallel paths/processes. That is, we will look at ways for the oral system and the 
written system to work together in harmony. These processes will be used by institutions 
when they develop and implement their policies and practices. 

How Will We Do This?
We will continually meet with Calgary’s Indigenous Elders and Traditional Knowledge 
Keepers as a method to break down the barriers we have with our relationships with 
Calgary’s Indigenous communities. As we build trust with them and learn about their 
protocols, we can then co-develop institutional processes and policies using the lens of 
ethical space.

parallel these world views in a way that does not diminish either, and that honours both.

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.13)

Council of champions
The Council of Champions is a diverse group 
of leaders in Calgary dedicated to building the 
foundations of resilience in children and youth. They 
aim to inspire action, create a community agenda, 
and influence policy development and systems-
level change to reduce barriers to positive child and 
youth development. They are committed to the 
principles of learning, leveraging and influencing 
together as a collective impact model.

United Way of Calgary and Area (UWCA) supports 
an inclusive and resilient city by leading several 
initiatives. They do this work in collaboration 
with many stakeholders. These are two of many 
examples. 

Ethical Space
UWCA first would like to acknowledge the land 
we are on is traditional land of the Blackfoot 
Confederacy, as well as Treaty 7 Territory that 
includes Kainai, Siksika, Piikani, Tsuut’ina and Stoney 
Nakoda nations. We also would like to acknowledge 
the Métis people and the Inuit people who made 
their home here in Calgary.
UWCA has begun work on developing a new 
Indigenous Strategy. This will enable Indigenous 
perspectives, knowledge and stories to grow 
throughout the governance, business and practices 
of the organization. The strategy will express our 
goal of becoming an ally, leader and supporter of 
Indigenous peoples as well as our effort to honour 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) 
and the Calls to Action that they brought forward. 
Reconciliation cannot only involve one group.
UWCA has chosen to involve multiple key 
stakeholders in the design and development of our 
Indigenous Strategy. In doing this, we are building 
an “Ethical Space” which cultivates a sense of 
security, mutual education and respect of both the 
Western and traditional ways of knowing, practicing 
and doing.
A circle of Elders, in consultation with the 
Indigenous community of Calgary, work together 
to find the parallels in Western and Indigenous 
ways of knowing and working together through 
the strategy. Led by Indigenous Protocol & Cultural 
Technicians who support and foster authenticity 
in working with Indigenous communities. This 
contributes to the development of United Way’s 
capacity to create transformative relationships 
between Elders and the non-profit sector. By 
resourcing “in-house” Elders to bring their oral 
stories and knowledge, and guide internal and 
external UWCA work, we will contribute to the 
truth, healing and reconciliation process within our 
community of influence.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 2C: 

Calgary institutions value diverse governance paradigms
Description: In the development of this outcome, we heard that Calgary’s equity-seeking 
communities (ESCs) are expected to fit into one governance paradigm that does not represent 
their different ways of decision-making and leading. This is projected to remain a challenge 
when strengthening relationships between Calgary’s institutions and ESCs in the future. 
ESCs believe that institutions can nurture their relationships with them by “going beyond” creating leadership 
and board opportunities for ESCs. Communities are concerned with having to “fit into” Calgary’s one governance 
structure. This diminishes the inherent worth of their diverse ways in decision-making and leadership. 
Rather than critiquing or challenging 
characteristics of individual leaders or 
even leadership styles, ESCs wants us to 
challenge the processes and structures 
of boards and institutional leadership. 
This requires a transformative shift in 
governance. A change is needed to shift our 
mental models of what good governance 
looks like from one governance paradigm 
to a multitude of effective governance 
paradigms. Institutions would need to 
broaden their fundamental values, beliefs 
and practices of effective governance. This 
would be a bold step forward for institutions 
to build trusted and informed relationships 
with ESCs.

Resilient CalgaryAction 2C.1:  Build a Governance Systems Map

Why Is This Important?

As a first step in this transformative process to build relationships, equity-
seeking communities (ESCs) want institutions to acknowledge the current 
systemic forces at play. It requires institutions to name the systems that 
maintain the governance paradigm in Calgary. It is only when institutions 
see how systems operate in the current governance paradigm, can 
they expand their mental models of multiple and effective governance 
paradigms.
What Will We Do?
We will develop a communications strategy to reveal to institutions the six conditions that 
hold our current governance paradigm in place.

How Will We Do This?
Guided by the FSG Conditions of Systems Change Framework, we will convene multiple 
stakeholders to assess how system change conditions are holding our governance in 
place. This includes exploring the relationships between system actors, the distribution 
of power and the institutional norms within governance. Once we understand these 
conditions, we will develop a communications strategy for institutions to understand the 
systemic forces at play.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 2D: 

Calgary institutions invest in equitable economic development
Description: In the development of this outcome, we heard that Calgary’s equity-seeking 
communities (ESCs) face barriers to accessing stable and sufficient income. This is projected to 
remain a challenge when strengthening relationships between Calgary’s institutions and ESCs 
in the future. This is a result of:
1.  The current scarcity and future uncertainty of meaningful and desired employment 

resulting from technology advances.

2.  The economic policies and practices that can’t keep up with the changes. 
We heard from ESCs that institutions can nurture 
their relationship with ESCs by investing existing 
resources in more intentional ways to advance 
equitable economic development. ESCs are asking 
institutions to be responsive to the fluctuating 
nature of Calgary’s economy that will be impacted 
by:
1.  Increased automation and the adoption of 

artificial intelligence in workplaces. 

2.  The changing nature of privacy rights with 

widespread access to the internet.

3.  Online working relationships between 

institutions and Calgarians.

As a result, ESCs want institutions to consider the social and environmental conditions in their financial and 
economic decision-making. When institutions invest in diverse markets, they can access otherwise undervalued 
or untapped assets while prioritizing equitable access to stable and sufficient income for all.

build relationships with them if they address social issues as business 
opportunities. It can enhance the competitiveness of a company while 
at the same time advancing the economic and social conditions in 
the communities in which it operates. Businesses meet societal needs 
through their investments.
More companies are now building and rebuilding business models around social good, 
which sets them apart from the competition and supports their success. With the help 
of ESCs, not-for-profits, governments, and other stakeholders, business has the power of 
scale to create real change on monumental social problems.

Resilient CalgaryAction 2D.2: 

 Develop a Social Procurement Policy and Strategy

Why Is This Important?

We heard from equity-seeking communities (ESCs) that Calgary’s 
municipal government should provide equal opportunities to ESCs in 
accessing government contracts and business opportunities. 
Municipalities spend millions of dollars each year on goods and services, from major 
construction projects to food, supplies, consulting and repairs. This public spending is 
a valuable lever for fostering more equitable economic development. Through social 
procurement policies, cities can ensure that underrepresented groups have access to 
these business opportunities. They can encourage a shift towards procurement based on 
achieving multiple outcomes in addition to maximizing financial value.

What Will We Do?
The City of Calgary will create a Sustainable, Social, Ethical and Environmental 
Procurement Policy (SSEEPP). It will advance the utilization of existing procurement to 
promote better social, economic and environmental outcomes.

How Will We Do This?
A SSEEPP Advisory Task Force will be established with representation from The City, 
local business, industry and community to support SSEEPP design, implementation, 
and evaluation. The project team will explore implementation options and initiate pilot 
projects to test and design the inclusion of more small, medium-sized businesses and 
social enterprises into direct procurement opportunities and into the supply chain of 
major contractors. They will use an outcomes-based measurement and reporting process 
aligned with existing City of Calgary policy, programs and strategies.

Resilient CalgaryAction 2D.3:  Explore Guaranteed Universal Basic Income Options

Why Is This Important?

We heard from equity-seeking communities (ESCs) that they are 
concerned with the impacts of the fourth industrial revolution. They are 
worried that the technological changes, such as increasing automation 
and digitalization will have a transformative impact on the world of work. 
These changes could lead to a jobless future and be a source of new 
income inequities. ESCs are asking institutions to seriously consider how 
people will survive with this uncertain future.
What Will We Do?
We will develop a policy brief that explores options in guaranteed universal basic income 
in Calgary. This brief will also detail the feasibility to implement these options.

How Will We Do This?
We will do an environmental scan on the current work that is being done in this area. We 
will also meet with stakeholders who are currently engaged in this work to understand 
their recommended options. Then we will work together to learn the challenges, benefits 
and opportunities in each of these options.

Calgary’s Natural 
Infrastructure 

 GOAL 
Natural infrastructure assets are identified, 
protected, tracked, managed and used to 
inform investment and planning decisions.

Pillar 3 The Future of Calgary's Natural Infrastructure

81

Resilient Calgary Overview

Resilience of a city, its communities and region are improved when 
integrated systems are in place to conserve, enhance and maintain our 
natural assets. 
Calgary has, and is surrounded by, natural beauty. Environmental spaces such as parks, water bodies and riparian 
areas abound. They are not just beautiful park spaces, but part of our natural infrastructure that provide multiple 
benefits. As Calgarians, we enjoy the municipal services as well as the social, economic and environmental 
advantages these spaces provide. These benefits are many. Natural infrastructure can provide recreational 
opportunities, contribute to our physical and mental well-being, reduce water treatment needs, reduce the 
impacts of flooding, improve air quality, reduce the urban heat island effect, provide wildlife habitat and more.
Currently, however, our natural assets are not protected and managed with the same coordinated approach as 
our other infrastructure assets. In Calgary, we have an opportunity to integrate natural infrastructure into our 
traditional infrastructure and asset management frameworks. A shared understanding of the value of natural 
infrastructure and the multitude of services they provide can assist decision-makers in making choices related to 
resource allocation and natural infrastructure investments.
As part of this pillar we will include natural infrastructure as part of our corporate asset management framework 
and measure their service value to inform investment and planning decisions. 
This will be achieved through three focused themes: 
•  Learning through awareness of our key natural infrastructure and the role they play in contributing to 

city resilience. 

•  Valuing through analysis of the services and multiple benefits they provide to inform decision-making 

processes and reporting.

•  Building through action by integrating our learning and analysis into City and regional policy and 

implementation projects.

These focused themes are further defined in the following three outcomes and six actions. They are as follow:

 Outcome 3A 
Calgarians are aware of our  
key natural infrastructure  
and its role in providing 
community benefits. 
Action 3A.1 
Natural Infrastructure Awareness 
materials shared with different 
audiences to increase our 
understanding of the role of 
natural infrastructure.
Action 3A.2 
Natural Infrastructure Inventory 
created to identify our key 
natural assets relied upon by 
Calgarians to deliver services. 

 Outcome 3B 
Calgarians are supported 
through sound analysis 
of natural infrastructure 
value that informs decision-
making. 
Action 3B.1 
Natural Infrastructure 
Valuation Toolkit adopted 
to support integrated 
and informed planning, 
management and investment 
decisions. 
Action 3B.2 
Natural Infrastructure 
Integration into City of Calgary 
land, asset management and 
financial reporting processes.

 Outcome 3C 
Calgarians are supported 
through strategic investment 
in natural infrastructure.
Action 3C.1 
Policy Integration to align and 
embed natural infrastructure 
into current and new relevant 
policy. 
Action 3C.2 
Implementation Support 
to develop design criteria 
and pilot a collaborative 
approach to innovative and 
strategic natural infrastructure 
investments.

With the help of resources from 100 Resilient 
Cities, The City of Calgary embarked on an effort to 
identify opportunities to further incorporate natural 
infrastructure into City-wide decision-making. The 
discovery area was co-led by the Climate Program in 
Environment and Safety Management and supported 
by a core project team of City business units. Further 
insight was provided by a broader collaboration 
circle that included non-governmental organizations, 
academia, education, industry, First Nations and the 
provincial government.

The 100RC resources included an opportunity to work 
with AECOM and Earth Economics as our Strategy and 
Platform Partners. They each produced reports to help 
guide the actions in this pillar. A highlight for their 
findings can be found in Resilience in Action stories 
(R1A.18 Dale Hodges Park: A Natural Infrastructure 
Case Study by AECOM and R1A.19 An Earth Economics 
Natural Infrastructure Blueprint for Calgary).

“Building Resilience with 
Nature: A Practitioner’s Guide 
to Action report” published by 
100RC in November 2018

Natural infrastructure provides a broad range of services and benefits to Calgarians and makes our city more 
attractive to live and work in. It can improve resilience to the gradual and sudden impacts of climate change. 
Healthy natural systems are self-adapting and require less intervention to thrive in changing conditions than more 
traditional hard infrastructure. It provides a foundation for a robust and healthy environment that is needed not 
only for us to survive, but to have a thriving economy and society. We know this from our experience with the 
2013 Flood and the real costs of response and recovery. 
The image above illustrates the connection between benefits provided by our natural assets to city resilience. 
It communicates the multiple resilience benefits of healthy natural assets to our health and well-being, our 
economy and society and city leadership and strategy. A key focus of this pillar is to understand and measure 
these benefits to inform decisions. 
The role of natural infrastructure is increasingly recognized as a contributor to managing flood risk and the 
provision of services from other municipalities and institutions. A November 2018 report published by 100RC 
notes that “Nature and natural infrastructure are critical assets in strengthening cities’ resilience to a broad range 
of resilience shocks and stresses — and a failure to protect or enhance them is a missed opportunity to unlock 
the economic, health and social dividends that strengthen our cities’ ability to thrive no matter what happens.” 
The report further outlines considerations for cities to leverage nature-based solutions. 
Another report published by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment indicates that “Natural 
infrastructure practices have the potential to play a critical role in making coastal, riverine, rural and urban 
communities more climate resilient.” According to The Insurance Bureau of Canada, “As a general ‘rule of thumb’, 
in order of preference, the most cost-effective means to mitigate flood losses utilizing natural systems is to: 
(i)   Retain what you have.
(ii)  Restore what you’ve lost.
(iii) Build what you must.
It is our intent that the actions under this pillar will provide the vision and tools for Calgary to protect our existing 
key natural assets, restore and enhance others, and build new natural infrastructure that will contribute to a resilient 
Calgary, for generations to come.

Resilient CalgaryClimate Resilience Strategy 

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.15)

Nature as a Community Asset 
Calgary has recently experienced severe and 
uncommon weather events, indicative of the long-
term changes in our local climate that will continue 
to bring more frequent and severe droughts, floods 
and storms. The City of Calgary has dedicated a 
team to facilitate corporate, citizen and business 
actions to mitigate and adapt to the impacts 
of climate change, guided by Calgary’s Climate 
Resilience Strategy that was adopted by Council in 
2018. Strategies are actioned by a multi-stakeholder 
Climate Panel to develop and build a collaborative 
force to achieve resilience. Community members, 
organizations, businesses and The City of Calgary 
are coming together with shared goals to take local 
climate action. 
Climate mitigation is a commitment to reducing 
the production of greenhouse gases. Actions are 
underway, including sustainable transportation 
options such as increased access to electric vehicle 
charging stations, developing a commercial energy 
benchmarking program and using renewable 
energy in City operations.
Calgary is also taking on climate adaptation based 
on the risks we’ve identified, such as increased heat 
days, flooding, and more intense storms. Adaptation 
actions include updating design standards and 
guidelines for City infrastructure and recognizing 
natural infrastructure as a critical component to 
a resilient city. Incorporating the assets and key 
services provided by natural infrastructure into 
the overall City asset management process will be 
the next step in valuing the innumerable benefits 
provided by natural infrastructure. 
Calgarians enjoy our natural spaces on a daily 
basis, and these assets can also serve an important 
function in urban climate change adaptation. Taking 
care of what we have and building our natural 
infrastructure is helping Calgary become a more 
resilient community.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 3A: 

Calgarians are aware of our key natural infrastructure and its role in providing 
community benefits
Description: This outcome supports our learning to understand the natural assets that 
Calgarians rely upon to deliver services and other benefits. We will identify our key natural 
assets and the services they provide and add them as a new asset class within our corporate 
asset management framework. As well, we will create a common vocabulary for natural 
infrastructure and related terms and share this information with various audiences. Audiences 
include The City of Calgary and the City Council, the general public and external partners in 
academia, industry and non-governmental organizations. We will work together and build on 
current awareness and education programs to align and build a common understanding of the 
role of natural infrastructure in contributing to city resilience and our community well-being.

Why Is This Important?

A shared understanding of the value of natural infrastructure as well as 
the municipal services and other co-benefits that they provide can help 
us to recognize our role in protecting and enhancing our natural assets 
for future generations. 
What Will We Do?
We will support the development of awareness and education materials to help 
different audiences understand the relationship between natural infrastructure and city 
resilience, their role, and opportunities to enhance our natural infrastructure including 
on private lands by landowners themselves. We will shepherd and enable key messages 
and alignment between current and planned education and awareness projects and 
programs such as work underway within Environmental & Safety Management, Water 
Resources, Parks as well as with related work led by the partners external to The City  
of Calgary.

How Will We Do This?
We will identify current state and assess opportunities and gaps for holistic awareness 
and education regarding what natural infrastructure is and the reason why it is important, 
the services provided, the broader value it brings, actions being taken by The City and 
others, and its role in our collective future.

Resilient CalgaryThe 2014 Calgary Tree Disaster

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.16)

Calgary’s weather is notoriously unpredictable. On 
Sept. 9-10, 2014, the largest September snowfall in 
130 years before the fall equinox occurred.
The big problem was Calgary’s trees still had all their 
leaves. The weight of heavy, wet snow snapped 
trees citywide. Many roads and pathways were 
impassible because of fallen trees and broken 
branches. Hanging tree limbs meant public 
safety hazards, especially near sidewalks, schools, 
businesses and public spaces.
Within three days, over 33,000 calls from citizens 
to 3-1-1 and 9-1-1 stretched City resources. These 
were the most calls for help The City has ever had 
(even surpassing the June 2013 flood). The Calgary 
Fire Department responded to more than 3,100 
storm-related events. Calgary Parks had 10,000 tree 
emergency service requests (five times more than 
it usually gets in an entire year). More than 50,000 
ENMAX customers lost power due to branches 
falling on wires, poles, etc. The power outages 
took out traffic signal lights at major intersections 
throughout the city.
In response to “Snowtember” and its path of 
destruction, Calgary’s Emergency Operations 
Centre (EOC) was activated early into the storm due 
to the extraordinary 9-1-1 and 3-1-1 call volumes. 
Calgary’s EOC agencies partnered with crews from 
Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource 
Development, Canada Task Force 2, EPCOR and The 
City of Edmonton.

The EOC deactivated after clearing streets, 
removing the most-pressing public safety hazards 
and restoring normal service levels. After that, 
the response phase shifted to the Parks Tactical 
Operations Centre (TOC) and continued with City 
and provincial agencies assessing and pruning 
14,000 tree hazards. As well, City business units 
worked systematically to remove 19,000 tonnes of 
tree debris from 227 communities.
Recovery and restoration phases in 2015-17 
delivered the ReTree YYC strategy, aimed at building 
a more resilient urban forest. ReTree’s successful 
results included: 
• 

Inspecting and pruning 357,000 public trees 
citywide.

•  Planting almost 25,000 trees to help replace 

those lost in the storm.

•  Engaging and empowering 79 communities to 

• 

plant and care for trees in their neighbourhoods.
Improving citizens’ access to tree care 
information through online courses, social media 
and various outreach initiatives.

A key learning from the ReTree YYC resiliency 
program was the importance of a robust tree 
pruning program. By pruning more public trees in 
2019-22, Urban Forestry is forecasting a decrease in 
3-1-1 tree emergency.

Resilient CalgaryAction 3A.2:  Natural Infrastructure Inventory

Why Is This Important?

The City does not have a consistent inventory approach and natural 
assets (such as rivers and riparian areas) are not included as part of 
our corporate land inventory or asset management frameworks. This 
lack of visibility from a corporate perspective puts their protection, 
enhancement, maintenance at risk. 
What Will We Do?
We will create a corporate inventory of key natural assets. We will formalize and 
describe a new natural asset class in the asset management policy, strategy, objectives, 
and corporate asset management plan. This will set the stage for natural assets to 
be identified and visible in corporate databases and to be included in infrastructure 
reporting.

How Will We Do This?
We will work with our current asset management specialists and asset owners to create a 
centralized natural infrastructure inventory of key natural assets.

Resilient CalgaryBee Friendly Boulevard – Helping pollinators,  
educators and reducing road maintenance

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.17)

Things are buzzing along Canyon Meadows 
Boulevard these days. Staff from across The  
City, along with partners from around Calgary, 
created a natural infrastructure project that will  
not only reduce maintenance in the area, but also 
create a home for pollinators such as bees and 
butterflies and provide educational opportunities 
for local schools. 
This pollinator-friendly corridor runs from Macleod 
Trail to Bow Bottom Trail and features native flowers, 
grasses and shrubs and nesting habitats including 
a log that visitors can open to see bees working, a 
bee hotel, and informational signs. A main bee bed 
— designed in the shape of a flower — has been 
built near Acadia Drive S.E. and Canyon Meadows 
Drive S.E. and several schools came out to help plant 
flowers around the bed.

Staff from The City worked together with individuals 
from the University of Calgary, Mount Royal 
University and the David Suzuki Foundation on the 
project. Researchers from the University of Calgary 
will continue to monitor the bee population to see if 
the number of species increases in the area.
The site incorporates re-purposed and recycled 
materials and was created with the involvement of 
over 300 students to plant milk weed for monarch 
butterflies. The materials used include logs for a bee 
nest from trees that were removed from a local golf 
course, as well as recycled concrete and sandstone 
boulders from road construction. 
The Bee Friendly Boulevard project is a great 
example of a natural infrastructure project that 
delivers value to Calgarians in a unique way. 
In early 2019, an endangered bee species was 
found on the site — a Gypsy Cuckoo Bee or Bombus 
bohemicus. Talk about buzz!

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 3B: 

Calgarians are supported through sound analysis of natural infrastructure value 
that informs decision-making
Description: Natural or ecological systems provide social, economic and environmental 
benefits. They support our physical and mental well-being and can contribute to a robust 
economy, in part by making the city more attractive to a skilled workforce and investment.  
This outcome supports valuing our natural infrastructure through sound analysis of the 
services and multiple benefits that natural infrastructure provides in order to inform decision-
making and corporate reporting. Having a shared understanding of the value of natural 
infrastructure and the municipal services and other co-benefits they provide can assist with 
the prioritization of decisions related to planning and development, resource allocation and 
natural infrastructure investments.

Resilient CalgaryAction 3B.1:  Natural Infrastructure Valuation Toolkit

Why Is This Important?

Current City processes do not fully account for the services and benefits 
provided by natural infrastructure in development and investment 
decision-making. This action will create decision criteria that takes into 
account the service value, as well as the environmental, social, economic 
and health benefits of natural infrastructure and embed them into City 
of Calgary infrastructure investment processes. This also aligns with the 
Climate Lens (climate resilience assessment) as required by Infrastructure 
Canada for certain funding requests.
What Will We Do?
We will identify and test valuation tools that measure the services as well as the broader 
environmental, social and economic resilience benefits provided by natural infrastructure 
for applicability to Calgary’s unique environment. As part of this we will consider current 
and future risk, co-benefits of natural infrastructure, natural asset connectivity and the 
long-term ecological function of the infrastructure in the full lifecycle of projects. This 
could include creating or informing a business case for natural infrastructure return-on-
investment.

How Will We Do This?
We will build from our understanding of the triple bottom line, social return on 
investment and the resilience dividend (in development), and the valuation tools 
currently being used in Water Resources and Parks to manage their assets, as well as 
the capital business case used in Infrastructure Calgary. We will collaborate with our 
community partners — in academia, non-governmental organizations and industry to 
identify, test and monitor valuation tools. Finally, we will consolidate our learning into a 
valuation toolkit, with recommendations and guidance for its use.

Resilient CalgaryDale Hodges Park: A Natural Infrastructure  
Case Study by AECOM

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.18)

For decades The City of Calgary has explored how to integrate engineered and natural or green 
infrastructure, and leverage the social, economic and environmental benefits of municipal services. One 
compelling example is Dale Hodges Park.
The City of Calgary’s acquisition of the former Klippert gravel pit presented an outstanding opportunity 
to restore the ecological integrity of the area, while at the same time enhancing the recreational and 
educational value of the east side of Bowmont Park. The park, named for former Calgary Alderman Dale 
Hodges, includes stormwater wetlands, wildlife habitat, trails for cycling and walking, and lookout points 
across the scenic river valley.
The site was originally acquired solely for parkland purposes and was intended to be restored to natural 
habitat. However, it became apparent that a number of other issues could be meaningfully addressed. Some 
of the considerations were: 

Issues
•  Untreated stormwater threatens the ecological 

health of the Bow River and specifically fish 
habitats.

•  High risk of industrial contamination of the 
Bow River during flooding or major storms 
– the former Klippert gravel pit contained 
concentrations of industrial waste and 
hydrocarbons.

•  Limited recreational and park areas lead to 
erosion of embankments and other paths.

Opportunities
•  Location and size of the site posed a unique 
opportunity to restore a disturbed gravel pit 
landscape into a natural environment with 
biodiversity, recreational and educational 
potential.

•  Opportunity to bring an innovative stormwater 

treatment solution into public focus.

•  Opportunity to incorporate public art into the 
design of stormwater treatment wetlands and 
its associated hard infrastructure in a way that 
added to the existing natural landscape context.

•  The project could be co-developed by Water 

Resources and Parks.

•  Community stakeholder support for the 

protection of natural habitat, recreational trails, 
and the stormwater design.

•  Realization of social, economic, environmental 

and resilience benefits.

The Dale Hodges Park is a key example of how 
Natural Infrastructure assets can be identified, 
protected, enhanced, monitored and managed 
as part of The City of Calgary’s asset management 
portfolio. This helps to demonstrate how the 
multiple benefits (economic, environmental, social 
and resilience) benefits can be understood and 
used to inform capital investment and planning 
decisions. As part of the Resilient Calgary strategy, a 
recommendation is to use a business case template 
to integrate and normalize this approach to natural 
infrastructure decision-making. 

The Quadruple Bottom Line Assessment of  
Natural Assets
The Water Research Foundation identified examples 
of the social, economic and environmental benefits 
of natural or green assets as shown below. The 
City of Calgary can consider adding a criterion for 
resilience when assessing natural assets. Including 
the assessment of Resilience adds another layer 
to the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), resulting in a 
Quadruple Bottom Line (QBL) analysis, as illustrated.

Resilient CalgaryAction 3B.2:  Natural Infrastructure Integration into City Processes

Why Is This Important?

Natural infrastructure assets are among Calgary’s most valuable assets, 
delivering City services and supporting community well-being. This 
action will embed the natural asset inventory into our corporate land and 
asset management processes and enable natural assets to be integrated 
into financial planning and managed through a Corporate service 
outcome and risk-based lens. 
What Will We Do?
We will assess existing programs to track and monitor natural assets and build upon the 
natural infrastructure awareness, inventory and valuation toolkit actions to integrate 
natural infrastructure into Corporate processes. Natural assets will be embedded and 
referenced in business unit asset management plans and reported in the Infrastructure 
Status Report. We will create a place in our Land Inventory Data Application (LInDA) for 
natural infrastructure to be identified and enable an environment to integrate natural 
assets into financial administration support and reporting activities over the long-term. 

How Will We Do This?
We will work with our land and asset management specialists to add natural assets to 
business unit asset management plans and our corporate land inventory as well as our 
financial team for future integrated financial planning.

Resilient CalgaryAn Earth Economics Natural Infrastructure  
Blueprint for Calgary

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.19)

The City of Calgary is well prepared to become a 
leader in utilizing nature to build economic and 
community resilience. Natural infrastructure is real 
infrastructure that can be combined with, or used in 
place of, grey infrastructure to provide vital services, 
often at lower cost and improved performance as 
compared with pure grey infrastructure solutions. 
The City can take steps to apply academic 
research, best practices, and lessons learned from 
cities around the world to fully integrate natural 
infrastructure concepts and opportunities broadly 
into budgeting, project development and long-term 
stewardship of The City’s resources.
This Natural Infrastructure Blueprint for The 
City of Calgary outlines four tangible steps that 
represent a cycle of awareness building, analysis 
and policy/procedure development. With long-
term commitment, The City can produce innovative 
solutions to its existing and pending challenges, and 
be a role model and resource to other large cities 
around the world in fostering long-term resilience. 
The steps are as follows:

 STEP 1 
Create Inventory
Create a detailed and dynamic inventory of Calgary’s 
natural assets. Without a full understanding of The 
City’s natural assets and the many physical and 
financial benefits provided to the local community, 
planners will be making decisions with partial data, 
putting outcomes at risk and elevating costs.

 STEP 2 
Raise Awareness and Set Targets
Build awareness and set bold targets for natural 
infrastructure’s role in Calgary’s future. Thoughtful 
targets can spur innovation, build public support, 
and create a vision. The City has an opportunity 
to refine existing targets and create new ones 
to focus the work and energy of all stakeholders 
on supporting The City’s reliance on natural 
infrastructure over the next 100 years.

 STEP 3 
Invest and Implement
Gather funding partners (City, private sector, 
other orders of government etc.) and implement a 
portfolio of projects. Natural infrastructure projects 
often require more creativity and collaboration 
to fund and implement than traditional grey 
infrastructure projects. This is an opportunity 
to bring City departments together with their 
stakeholders to define and explore new ways of 
working together. 

 STEP 4 
Monitor outcomes
Monitor the performance and outcomes of natural 
infrastructure to inform the next phase of planning 
and investment. This type of work is often new and 
challenging. As with any new field, there will be 
successes and shortfalls. Implementing a strong 
process to glean and apply lessons learned is vital 
to the efficiency, cost and overall success of the 
initiative over time. While the steps themselves are 
simple in concept, success requires serious focus and 
a commitment of funds and staff over time. They are 
summarized in the figure below.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 3C: 

Calgarians are supported through strategic investment in natural infrastructure
Description: Current City processes do not fully account for the benefits of natural 
infrastructure in development and investment decision-making. The City also does not have a 
consistent policy or operations and maintenance approach putting their long-term planning 
and maintenance at risk. This outcome will support building through action by integrating our 
learning and analysis into City and regional policy and implementation projects. An identified 
opportunity is to establish an integrated approach to natural infrastructure management 
and decision-making as part of The City’s ongoing capital investment, planning and asset 
management processes. As well, this outcome will support integrated decisions and operations 
and maintenance for natural infrastructure investments on school sites such as school site 
naturalization projects.

Resilient CalgaryAction 3C.1:  Natural Infrastructure Policy Integration

Why Is This Important?

Natural infrastructure is currently absent or not consistently recognized 
in City and regional policy. This will help us align policy in our Municipal 
Development Plan, Corporate Environmental Policy, Regional Growth 
Strategy and related strategies and plans, and take into account changes 
in legislation related to environmental well-being, climate change and 
shared regional services. 
What Will We Do?
Identify alignment and gap areas in the Planning & Development planning continuum 
and Corporate Policy with regard to natural infrastructure. As a component of policy plan 
updates or new policy at The City of Calgary, embed reference to natural infrastructure 
where it is relevant and currently absent. As a component of new regional policy 
development, recommend the integration of policies that support natural infrastructure 
and resilience to the Calgary Municipal Regional Board (CMRB) Growth Plan and Servicing 
Plans.

How Will We Do This?
This initiative will have three focus areas: Planning & Development, Corporate Policy, 
and Regional Policy. Working with policy leads, align with current time frames for policy 
review and the creation of new policy. Identify gap areas regarding natural infrastructure 
in existing policy and opportunities to include natural infrastructure in new policy 
development.

Resilient CalgaryCalgaryEATS! 

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.20)

Ensuring a healthy, secure food supply requires a 
resilient food system that can adapt to both natural 
and human-made shocks and stressors posed by 
climate change, rapid urbanization, economic 
crises and other factors. A resilient food system can 
bounce back from disruptions in each link in the 
food supply chain, from farm to fork. People with 
low incomes, residents of food deserts, people 
with disabilities, seniors and people experiencing 
homelessness may be most at risk of losing access to 
safe and nutritious food during and after a disaster. 
The CalgaryEATS! Food Action Plan was endorsed 
by City Council in 2012. Its goals focus on creating 
a sustainable and resilient food system by 
increasing urban and regional food production 
and consumption, ensuring access to healthy and 
nutritious food for all Calgarians, and ensuring a 
secure supply of food for all Calgarians. 

Through the implementation of CalgaryEATS!, 
The City of Calgary is facilitating improved access 
to healthy food to consumers while creating 
favorable conditions to ensure the investments 
needed to increase food production, processing 
and distribution capacities can be realized. 
Ensuring Calgarians have access to nutritious, safe 
and affordable food, creating decent jobs and 
income opportunities for small-scale producers 
and businesses, and encouraging more local food 
production lessen the dependence on distant 
supply sources. Recent amendments to the Land 
Use Bylaw lay the foundation for achieving these 
objectives. The amendments provide new economic 
opportunities for both small- and large-scale 
indoor food growing businesses and much needed 
opportunities for local food distribution.

Resilient CalgaryAction 3C.2:  Natural Infrastructure Implementation Support

Why Is This Important?

This initiative will help to align policy and implementation and test 
innovative approaches to natural infrastructure within the Calgary region. 
It will provide an integrated approach to natural infrastructure project 
planning and implementation across multiple stakeholders and provide 
a platform to share learning and improve practices. A pilot focus area will 
be Calgary Board of Education (CBE) school sites. The CBE is the second 
largest landowner in Calgary after The City of Calgary and this action will 
help to support decisions related to natural infrastructure investments on 
school sites such as school site naturalization projects.
What Will We Do?
We will take part in projects and partnerships where natural infrastructure can be 
protected and projects built, monitored and evaluated to provide multiple benefits and 
resilient value. This will be tied to learning and awareness, valuation, policy alignment 
and supported decision-making to enable project approval and implementation. This 
will support innovation, the development of partnerships, broaden access to funding and 
support shared risk. A key output of this action will be design guidelines to inform school 
site naturalization and other projects. 

How Will We Do This?
We will learn from projects within our region and broader network and work with external 
stakeholders to support the application of natural infrastructure concepts in capital 
development activities. This will be achieved primarily through four focus areas: a new 
Climate/Developer Advisory Committee, a Natural (or Green) Stormwater Infrastructure 
program, a Habitat Restoration Program and the school site naturalization program.

Resilient CalgaryCalgary’s Riparian Action Program

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.21)

Riparian areas occupy the spaces where land  
and water interact. They border rivers, creeks  
and wetlands and extend across the floodplain, 
down into the groundwater and upwards to 
include plants and trees. Networks of healthy, 
well-connected riparian areas are vital natural 
infrastructure for cities, contributing immensely 
to our city’s resilience. Some of the key ecosystem 
services provided by healthy, intact riparian areas 
include; flood risk management, clean, safe water 
and increased biodiversity.
In 2013, City Council approved a Riparian Strategy, 
outlining a high level framework with a vision, 
principles, and strategies for protecting our riparian 
areas. From that strategy came The Riparian Action 
Program (RAP), a 10-year implementation plan for 
protecting, restoring and raising awareness about 
Calgary’s river areas. The RAP takes an integrated 
approach that includes land use planning, 
restoration + monitoring and education + outreach. 
The program is part of The City’s integrated water 
management approach and contributes to our goal 
of healthy rivers and watersheds.
A key action under the restoration and monitoring 
program area is to integrate bioengineering 
techniques into riverbank restoration. 
Bioengineering is the use of vegetation and natural 
materials for slope stabilization, erosion reduction 
and vegetation establishment. 

Bioengineering is more ecologically beneficial than 
hard riprap designs  — the practice of armoring 
and stabilizing banks with rock. While riprap is 
an effective immediate answer to erosion, it can 
negatively impact riparian health. By pushing 
for bioengineering solutions, bank stabilization 
objectives are met while also creating critical 
habitat for fish and wildlife, improving water  
quality and creating areas of natural beauty in our 
urban landscapes. 
A flagship example is the Bioengineering 
Demonstration and Education Project (BDEP), 
located on the Bow River in Calgary between Pearce 
Estate Park and the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary. 
The BDEP is a joint effort between The City of 
Calgary and Alberta Environment and Parks and 
aims to improve fish habitat, stabilize slopes 
and demonstrate the effectiveness of various 
bioengineering techniques. A new interpretive 
pathway and the development of several 
education programs will increase awareness and 
understanding around bioengineering techniques 
and facilitate knowledge transfer, research and 
partnerships between  The City of Calgary, the 
Province, professional practitioners, industry, 
academia and the public. 

Before (left) and after (right) at the BDEP – a new bioengineering timber crib wall and boulders placed in the river create 
improved fish habitat, enhance bank stabilization and improve biodiversity.

Resilient Calgary Overview

Resilience of a city improves when the community has access to 
infrastructure. If the infrastructure is designed to accommodate  
the diverse and ever-changing makeup of the community, it will  
serve the intended purpose. If adaptable, it will accommodate 
unintended uses. Harder working, multi-use and co-created 
infrastructure or retro-fits may be solutions to consider in response to 
a growing and diverse population, emerging natural impacts due to a 
changing climate, and a value-based interest in public funded projects. 
We also must prepare for a future that is connected socially, digitally, 
automatically and technologically.
Calgary has a long history of infrastructure investment. 
Our community is well served by water, wastewater 
and sewage facilities, good quality roads and 
transportation networks, public transit systems, 
recreation facilities, education and legal facilities and 
energy facilities. We have begun important investment 
in capital requirements that will support our resilience 
in the face of shocks and stresses, such as flood 
adaptation and mitigation, facility and infrastructure 
sensors, and dark fibre.
The City of Calgary has historically made significant 
improvements to capital management processes at 
a departmental level. In recent years, an enterprise-
wide approach to infrastructure investment has 
been initiated to reach multiple resilience goals. 
These include stimulating the economy by increasing 
the quality and velocity of capital expenditures, 
strengthening investment decision-making to 
maximize the return for Calgarians, enhancing capital 
delivery efficiency and effectiveness, improving 
transparency and line of sight for key stakeholders, 
and attracting investment to Calgary. Continuing this 
approach to infrastructure investment to support 
public services is critical.
Following Council’s Five Guidelines to Administration, 
Capital Infrastructure Investment Principles provide 
greater alignment to The City’s shift towards service 
plans and budgets. Intentional management of capital 
will: support the delivery of City services at approved 
service levels; promote the well-being of communities, 
environment, and economy; build an adaptable, 

resilient and smart city; enhance the long-term  
value of City assets; integrate, coordinate and  
optimize The City’s investment; and optimize  
financing and funding sources.
The outcomes and actions provided in this pillar 
are intended to keep an intentional focus on 
the relationship between services and capital 
planning, so that Calgarians are supported through 
strategic investment in future-focused and resilient 
infrastructure.
This will be achieved through two outcomes and  
four actions:

 Outcome 4A 
Calgary infrastructure 
investment is strategic, 
coordinated and future-

Resilient Calgary Value Proposition

Strategic investment and management of all infrastructure assets (hard, natural, community) will be one of 
the municipality’s most challenging undertakings. If well managed, this will result in significant benefits to the 
community (return on investment) and improved community, city and regional resilience.

 Our Journey

Understanding infrastructure investment in supporting a resilient community
As a member of the 100 Resilient Cities network, a 
variety of tools, academic information and experience 
shared by other global cities is available to help better 
understand the components required to support a 
resilient community. The City Resilience Framework 
(CRF), available through 100 Resilient Cities, provides 
a lens to understand the complexity of cities and 
the drivers that contribute to their resilience. When 
developing its 2019-2022 capital budget, The City 
of Calgary capital business case format included 
reference to the framework drivers. This information 
was contained within a business case summary that 
identified key drivers such as resilience, economic 
investment and service support. This was a new 

approach taken to help us better understand what 
investments are occurring to help our community 
withstand stresses and shocks. Consistent with The 
City’s capital prioritization focusing on essential 
capital, the majority of new capital investments for 
2019-2022 focus on critical infrastructure and asset  
risk mitigation.
Over the next four years, we will continue to 
develop a better understanding of the resilience 
return on investment in future-ready infrastructure 
that supports service delivery. This work will be 
conducted through the oversight of the Resilience and 
Infrastructure Calgary business unit.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 4A: 

Calgary infrastructure investment is strategic, coordinated and future-focused
Description: The City of Calgary seeks to improve the quality of life, build public confidence 
and trust, and demonstrate service value to Calgarians. Capital planning and investment 
plays a pivotal role in creating inclusive, accessible and connected communities and dynamic 
economies, contributing to a resilient city. Council affirmed the role of capital investment in 
building and improving city resilience by approving the Capital Infrastructure Investment 
Strategy in 2015. A corporate capital strategy enables The City to restructure and increase  
its capacity to intentionally provide economic stimulus, add resilience to the community, 
maintain and preserve The City’s infrastructure and community assets through lifecycle 
funding, build a great community through legacy investments and leverage external public 
and private investments.

Resilient CalgaryInfrastructure Recovery and Resilience: 2013 Flood

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.22)

In 2013 June, Calgary was impacted by a flood 
disaster resulting in significant municipal 
infrastructure damage — at that time, estimated 
at more than $400 million total damages. When 
the 2013 flood occurred, The City did not have a 
coordinating process to monitor, track and report 
on infrastructure recovery and resilience. Previous 
smaller disaster events analyzed by the Calgary 
Emergency Management Agency had taught us  
that a coordination role would be necessary to 
reduce service, insurance and financial risks for  
the organization, and the establishment of a 
Recovery Operations Centre (ROC) was identified by 
The City of Calgary as an important civic role post-
disaster event. 
The ROC was established to oversee five recovery 
pillars, two of which were Infrastructure and 
Funding. Immediately after the flood occurred, a 
Municipal Infrastructure Recovery Program (MIRP) 
was established as part of the ROC to track, monitor 
and report to City Council and the public about City 
of Calgary infrastructure and asset recovery and 
funding progress. 
The MIRP had a responsibility to help with progress 
reporting to the public who were dependent on 
services supported by infrastructure, and to ensure 
financial prudence and share this with Council. The 
primary goal of business units was to restore public 
services supported by infrastructure; a secondary 
and equally important goal was to reduce financial 
risk to the organization. 
The MIRP team was put in place with dedicated 
resources offered by each impacted business 
unit/service, reporting to an MIRP coordinator, 
who reported to the ROC. This matrix model was 
one of the first of its kind at The City of Calgary, 
streamlining communication to Council on 
infrastructure recovery and financial reporting, 
and with an intention to create efficiencies in 
internal processes. A portfolio coordination process 
was established, refined over the first few years 

as expectations by insurance providers and the 
provincial recovery team were clarified, and project 
prioritization related to risk and funding availability 
was conducted. 
The development of a reporting framework to 
track project progress, funding source and budget 
was established. Monthly reports on the progress 
and status of the recovery work continue to be 
conducted, and The City of Calgary standard of 
practice has been integral to support evidence-
based updates that support a high rate of success 
in receiving funds from insurance and other 
government recovery and resilience programs. 
Regular information updates are provided to the 
public through an online map that showed every 
MIRP project, progress recovery and cost. Six 
years post-flood, this team of City staff continue 
to oversee the project completion and financial 
recovery of approximately 240 flood impacted 
infrastructure and asset projects.
The matrix model that supported the success of 
the MIRP infrastructure recovery and investment in 
resilience has been a foundation of the approach 
taken to Infrastructure Calgary, the current City 
of Calgary portfolio approach to infrastructure 
investment.

Resilient CalgaryAction 4A.1: 

 Apply a Resilience Lens to Strengthen Public  
Infrastructure Investment Decisions

Why Is This Important?

Calgary has a long history of infrastructure investment; whether it is 
new or maintaining what is in place in support of service to citizens. Our 
community is well served by water, wastewater and sewage facilities, 
good quality roads and transportation networks, public transit systems, 
recreation facilities, parks, pathways, education and legal facilities and 
energy facilities. We have begun important capital investment that 
will support resilience in the face of shocks and stresses, such as flood 
adaptation and mitigation, facility and infrastructure sensors, and the 
investment in dark fibre.
What Will We Do?
The City of Calgary has embraced a service-based approach to meet the needs of our 
residents and support our City vision of a great place to make a living, and a great place 
to make a life. Infrastructure investment supports the current and future services that our 
community needs. It is strategic and supported by a coordinated view of the whole city. 
During the One Calgary service plan and budget process, capital planning was conducted 
at a portfolio level, enabling a holistic planning view of all City of Calgary capital for the first 
time. A resilience lens was included in this planning view.
The City of Calgary will mature enterprise-wide processes and practices to support 
investments that keep public infrastructure resilient to future stresses and shocks. This 
will be coordinated through Infrastructure Calgary program goals to support capital 
infrastructure investment recommendations.

How Will We Do This?
Through the delivery of the One Calgary 2019-2022 service plans and budgets, The City 
of Calgary will continue activities to align capital planning under one portfolio and to the 
Capital Infrastructure Investment Principles. Governance and oversight of portfolio capital 
planning and budget recommendations will be overseen by Infrastructure Calgary, a cross-
departmental coordination steering committee of services responsible for capital delivery. 
The inclusion of a resilience lens as part of the reporting and measuring of capital delivery 
will continue and be refined through the work plan of Infrastructure Calgary. This work will 
include maturation processes, taking guidance from reviews conducted by consultants 
including the Initial Infrastructure Business Case Assessment Review conducted by our 
resilience strategy partner, AECOM. We will also undertake a research and development 
project to adapt existing benefit-cost and return on investment toolkits to the Calgary 
context and include additional categories of social, cultural and environmental impacts.

Resilient CalgaryAction 4A.2: 

 Maintain and Improve the Infrastructure  
That Supports Service Needs

Why Is This Important?

The City of Calgary owns, operates and maintains a wide range of 
infrastructure assets. These assets support social, economic and 
environmental services that The City provides. To continue to provide 
these services, and align infrastructure assets to best support service 
delivery, it is important to know the state of our current assets. This 
information helps us effectively and efficiently manage our infrastructure. 
With proper asset management, The City can play its role in fostering 
the local economy through ongoing investments in infrastructure. In 
addition, this information also helps us effectively plan quality services for 
the citizens of Calgary.
What Will We Do?
City infrastructure and assets are appropriately maintained over their entire lifecycle and 
are aligned with known service needs and priorities. Assets that no longer meet service 
needs are identified. Innovative solutions which may be non-asset based are explored to 
achieve service needs. The infrastructure funding gap to support asset maintenance will 
be reduced.

How Will We Do This?
The City of Calgary embraces widely accepted asset management policies and practices 
essential for providing safe and reliable services to citizens. Continuing to mature in this 
area will be accomplished by focusing on three key areas. The first is to ensure clarity 
of prioritization criteria and processes related to infrastructure investment planning 
and project portfolio management. This ensures investments are directed towards 
the areas of highest value. The second focus area is formal and uniform identification 
and cataloging of critical assets. Third, The City will focus on clear and consistent data 
collection related to all assets, and critical assets in particular.

Resilient Calgary OUTCOME 4B: 

Calgary services are supported by shock and stress resilient watershed systems
Alberta has experienced significant changes to its climate in recent decades. Average annual 
temperatures in Alberta are expected to increase from nine to 27 heat days (29°C or above) per 
year by the 2050s and up to 49 heat days by the 2080s, depending on global and local actions 
to reduce carbon pollution. Just as a fever can be dangerous in our body, a change of a few 
degrees can have significant and dangerous impacts on the climate. Climate change hazards 
have worrying implications for cities, including impacts on city water resources, damage to and 
failure of infrastructure, threats to human health and increased mortality.
Climate modelling tells us that Calgary will experience more severe and frequent extreme weather events such 
as flooding, drought and the effects of wildfires. In 2013, Calgary experienced its worst flood in recent memory, 
impacting 15 per cent of our city’s geographic region, including our economic core in the downtown. Residents, 
small and large businesses and infrastructure were all impacted, with flood recovery and resilience building 
continuing in 2019. Following the flood, our community interest in preparing for future flood events was 
heightened, leading to resilient and adaptive infrastructure investments, a focus on small business continuity 
planning, and supportive neighbourhood preparedness activities and network building began.
Great work has been done to best understand our flood risk in Calgary, and The City of Calgary has developed a 
flood resilience plan. Contributing to this flood risk work has been a robust forecast of our climate resilience, and 
a review of our climate related actions. Looking forward, our focus has expanded to be comprehensive of our 
overall relationship with water.
The City of Calgary works to ensure we have a healthy, resilient watershed capable of providing clean, reliable 
water for our current needs and future generations. The City is dedicated to implementing the Government of 
Alberta’s Water for Life Strategy through an Integrated Watershed Planning Strategic Framework that ensures 
reliable and resilient water servicing for Calgary and regional customers. The City provides drinking water and 
wastewater treatment to about 1 in 3 Albertans. Working with the Province and regional partners, The City 
aims to protect the water supply, use water wisely, keep rivers healthy and build resiliency to flooding. The City 
delivers on this commitment through three lines of service: water treatment and supply, wastewater collection 
and treatment, and stormwater management. 
Increased pressure on watersheds from growth in the region as well as the impacts of a changing climate 
make watershed management one of Calgary’s most critical resilience challenges. The City’s commitment to 
watershed protection considers the needs of a growing customer base and balancing the economic, social and 
environmental impacts of our decisions, programs and actions. Sustainable management of our shared water 
resources is the driving force behind an integrated watershed management approach. 

Pillar 4 Future Ready Infrastructure

113

Resilient CalgaryAction 4B.1: 

 Implement an Integrated Watershed  
Management Approach 

Why Is This Important?

The City’s Integrated Watershed (the land that drains into our 
rivers) Management approach is essential to protect public health 
and the environment, while strengthening our resiliency to a 
changing climate. Calgary must develop our communities with a 
focus on achieving future water security and a sustainable water 
supply. Watershed management must be integrated into our land 
use policies, plans and decisions to ensure healthy watersheds 
and rivers.
What Will We Do?
Infrastructure investment supports Integrated Watershed Management in the 
following areas:
•  Building resiliency to climate change – in Water Utility operations and 

infrastructure.

•  Flood and drought mitigation – at the municipal and regional levels.
•  Resilient Sustainable regional water supply.
•  Reducing stormwater impacts and improving stormwater quality.
•  Riparian (river bank) area protection.
•  Water efficiency and managing water demand.
•  Ensuring appropriate/sufficient water and wastewater treatment capacity.
How Will We Do This?
Water Resources continues to identify and invest in watershed management 
as on-going relationships with internal services, utilities, other orders of 
government and other stakeholders continue to identify and/or invest in 
infrastructure. This work will be considered as an integral part of the deliverable 
within Action 4A.1. Integrated Watershed Management work underway by The 
City includes:
•  Flood Resilience Plan 
•  Source Water Protection Plan 
•  Riparian Action Program
•  Water Efficiency Plan

Infrastructure Recovery and Resilience: 2013 Flood

RESILIENCE IN ACTION (RIA.23)

Since the 1930’s, the Glenmore Dam has been 
integral to Calgary’s water infrastructure system. In 
the 1930’s, Calgary was experiencing an economic 
recession coupled with a growing population 
dependent on a reliable water source. The Glenmore 
Dam was an infrastructure stimulus program 
designed to respond to the water service need and 
to create jobs for the local economy.
The Glenmore dam and reservoir has since 
then provided important flood and drought 
management in Calgary. Following the 2013 flood, 
The City considered the role of the dam itself and 
the capacity of the reservoir to contain additional 
water during high peak flows. Additionally, the 
value of the reservoir during water shortages was 
considered. Investing in our water management 
infrastructure is considered an essential, and critical, 
municipal responsibility.

As a result, The City of Calgary identified 
improvements could be made to upgrade 
the Glenmore dam to provide greater water 
management service and improved ease of 
operation for Calgary.
The Glenmore Dam will be under construction 
from spring 2017 until 2020, realizing important 
integrated water management services and the co-
benefit of being a popular link within our regional 
pathway system. Upgrades include a new bridge 
deck with better access for pathway users, concrete 
work on the face of the dam and a new steel gate 
and hoist system. This is a cost-shared project 
supported by The City of Calgary and Province of 
Alberta funding.

Resilient CalgaryAction 4B.2:  Develop a Watershed Investment Strategy

Why Is This Important?

This action will help us to address challenges related to our 
source watershed including: land use change from population 
growth and development that stresses water systems; and 
impacts from climate change such as high intensity storms and 
wildfires. There is an opportunity to move source watershed 
protection into various city and regional conversations and to 
provide incentives to private landowners and stakeholders for 
projects that achieve positive watershed benefits. 
What Will We Do?
Through this action we will garner internal and external support for a City of 
Calgary Watershed Investment Program and develop a Watershed Investment 
Strategy that includes financial mechanisms for partnerships, micro-grants and 
a strategy for protecting natural infrastructure or building green stormwater 
infrastructure in The City of Calgary.

How Will We Do This?
We will work with a consultant, subject matter experts and stakeholders 
to identify who, where and how others are having success with watershed 
investment strategies and leverage related work and research to inform this 
action.

Resilient CalgaryAcknowledgements

The Resilient Calgary strategy is our next step in 
a historical commitment to resilience in our great 
city. We have a strong legacy of visionary thinking 
translated into action; we have built our communities 
with a focus on housing, connectivity and well-being, 
we have developed a transportation network that 
supports every mode of travel; we have a strong 
business community that has a voice; we have 
welcomed guests and supported people with arts, 
recreation, sports and leisure; we have an incredible 
community of leadership and grass roots activity that 
comes together when we are tested through stresses 
and shocks. Our resilient challenges remain those 
we have identified in our historic plans and policies: 
keeping our community green, our economy strong, 
our infrastructure and assets working for us, and most 
importantly, our people vested in each other’s success. 
The Resilient Calgary strategy represents a 
point in time: our strategy was developed as we 
recovered from a significant flood, while we have 
been responding to an economic downturn not 
experienced in decades, and while we see our 
community struggling to overcome job loss, maintain 
mental wellness, and including new neighbours. The 
actions and outcomes represented in this strategy are 
not a starting point — they are an intentional force. 
Together we have placed a lens on the most urgent 
resilience issues, lifted our awareness of each other’s 
efforts to build resilience, and leveraged our collective 
action to achieve our vision of Calgary: a great city to 
make a living, and a great city to make a life.

Resilient CalgaryCapital Prioritization Criteria: a set of criteria 
established in 2018 by Infrastructure Calgary to help 
prioritize capital investment recommendations to 
support the One Calgary 2019-2022 service plans and 
budgets. Three categories of investment were defined: 
essential, current and enhanced.
City Foresight is the science of thinking about the 
future of a city
Climate Resilience Strategy: The City of Calgary’s 
Climate Resilience Strategy outlines The City’s strategies 
and actions to:
1.  Reduce our contributions to climate change by 
improving energy management and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions (climate change 
mitigation).

2.  Respond to a changing climate by implementing 
risk management measures to reduce the impact 
of extreme weather events and climatic changes 
on infrastructure and services (climate change 
adaptation).

Corporate Asset Management Plan (CAMP): The 
City of Calgary corporate plan which comprises 
individual business unit asset management plans and 
serves as an action plan for the improvement of The 
Corporation’s Asset Management System (including 
practices, technology, people and business processes).
Corporate Project Management Framework 
(CPMF): created to lead improving our processes and 
ultimately the quality of work for selecting, building 
and reporting on capital construction projects.
Current Capital: capital investments needed to 
maintain a level of service at existing levels.
Digital Disparity: the gap between demographics, 
education and regions that are able to access modern 
information and communications technology.

Appendices

Appendix 1: Glossary
Agenda-Setting Workshop: the Agenda-Setting 
Workshop was the first step in purposeful resilience 
building. It brought together a diverse group of 
stakeholders and city leaders to discuss the concept 
of urban resilience and identify the city’s resilience 
priorities — the goal was the collectively set the 
agenda for a resilient Calgary.
5G: 5th Generation of cellular mobile communications. 
5G realizes a marked performance enhancement 
over previous generations for high data rate, reduced 
latency, energy saving, cost reduction, higher system 
capacity, and massive device connectivity.
Biodiversity: the variability among living organisms 
— animals, plants, their habitats and their genes — 
from all sources including terrestrial, marine and other 
aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes 
of which they are part. This includes diversity within 
species, between species, and of ecosystems. 
(International Union for Conservation of Nature per 
“Our BiodiverCity: Calgary’s 10-year biodiversity 
strategic plan.”)
Business Continuity: the process of creating systems 
of prevention, mitigation and recovery to deal with 
potential stresses and shocks to an organization or 
business.
Calgary Economic Development (CED): managed by 
an independent Board of Directors, Calgary Economic 
Development is a not-for-profit corporation funded by 
The City of Calgary, community partners, other orders 
of government and the private sector to steward 
Calgary’s Economic Development Strategy.
Capital Infrastructure Investment Principles 
(CIIP): to support the purposeful approach to 
capital investment, Council approved the Capital 
Infrastructure Investment Principles (CIIP) in March 
2018. This is an update to the previously approved 
Capital Infrastructure Investment Strategy (CIIS) from 
November 2015. Infrastructure Calgary is responsible 
for the implementation of these principles. These 
principles emphasize that intentional management of 
capital at The City will: Support the delivery of City of 
Calgary services, at approved service levels; Promote 
the well-being of communities, environment, and 
economy; Build an adaptable, resilient and smart city; 
Enhance the long-term value of City assets; Integrate, 
coordinate and optimize The City’s investment.

Resilient CalgaryDiversity: is about consciously understanding and 
appreciating different ways of being and knowing and 
ensuring that our communities reflect and respect all 
differences in all its forms.
Dominant Group: not necessarily a majority in terms 
of numbers, but the group with power, privilege and 
social status in a society. Attributes of this group are 
accepted as the ‘norm’ by which other groups are 
measured or compared, often to their detriment.
Drivers of Change: are factors which bring change 
in our society. They can cause significant or disruptive 
change within a system. Examples include artificial 
intelligence learning to be social and ethical.
Ecosystem: a dynamic system of plants, animals 
and other organisms, together with the non-living 
components of the environment, that functions as an 
interdependent unit. (per “Our BiodiverCity: Calgary’s 
10-year biodiversity strategic plan”)
Enhanced Capital: capital investments needed 
to provide an increase in the level of service of an 
existing service or introduce a new service
Environmentally Significant Area: an area that 
has been assessed prior to potential development 
and which, because of its features or characteristics, 
is significant to Calgary from an environmental 
perspective. (per “Our BiodiverCity: Calgary’s 10-year 
biodiversity strategic plan”)
Essential Capital: capital investments needed to 
meet legal, regulatory, health and safety requirements, 
critical infrastructure, critical asset risk mitigation or 
minimize service delivery costs
Equity: an approach whereby all people – including 
those who bear the burden of historic and 
contemporary forms of marginalization, whether 
intentional or unintentional – have equal access to 
opportunities to define and achieve goals. Equity is 
more than an outcome; it is an on-going process that 
seeks to correct systemic barriers and create a more 
just and fair society for all.

Equity-Seeking Communities (ESCs): include 
groups of people who generally have less access 
to opportunities, resources, and systems of power 
because of their actual or perceived identity or 
identities. Equity-seeking communities often 
experience social and financial disadvantages because 
of systems of oppression. Oppression takes many 
forms including but not limited to racism, sexism,  
and ableism. Examples of ESCs include but are not 
limited to: 
• 

Indigenous peoples, women, racialized/people 
of color, immigrants, members of non-western 
religions, people with mental illness or physical or 
intellectual disabilities, older adults, youth, people 
experiencing poverty, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
trans-identified, intersex, queer/questioning, two-
spirited (LGBTIQ2S+) people, etc.

This list is not exhaustive and is always evolving. 
People who belong to multiple ESCs often experience 
overlapping and interdependent systems of 
discrimination or disadvantage.
Ethical Space: is the space created where the parallel 
processes of decision-making between Indigenous 
and Western worldviews co-exist. Creating ethical 
space is especially important when issues at hand 
impact both Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
communities. Ethical space can be fostered by 
‘walking together in parallel paths’ where stakeholders 
with distinct worldviews work together, converge, and 
collaborate in meaningful ways (Ermine, 2007).
FSG: originally known as the Foundation Strategy 
Group, this organization re-imagines social change by 
helping groups worldwide find ways to create more 
equitable and sustainable futures.
Green Infrastructure: many cities, including The 
City of Calgary also use the term green infrastructure 
to specifically denote stormwater systems that 
use natural processes and green technologies to 
improve the quality, and decrease the volume of, 
stormwater runoff entering our waterways. In some 
instances (such as with Infrastructure Canada) green 
infrastructure includes any environmentally based or 
clean energy infrastructure.
Governance Paradigm: are the values, beliefs, 
assumptions, interpretations, and biases that shape 
structures, policies, and processes that determine  
how decision-making and accountability occurs  
within institutions.

Resilient CalgaryHuman Rights: are those “that belong to persons 
simply by virtue of their being human.” (Goodhart, 
2011, p. 745).
imagineCALGARY: long-term outlook document for 
The City of Calgary containing the 100-year vision 
and 30-year targets and goals, as well as strategies 
for accomplishing these goals. It was developed with 
input from thousands of Calgarians to help create a 
sustainable future and exceptional quality of life for 
generations to come.
Inclusion: is the process of creating a culture and 
environment that recognizes, appreciates, and 
effectively utilizes the talents, skills, and perspectives 
of every individual. An inclusive environment uses 
these skills to achieve the organization’s objectives 
and mission; connects individuals to the organization; 
and encourages collaboration, flexibility, and fairness.
Indigenous Peoples: refers collectively to First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis people. The word recognizes 
the fact that Indigenous peoples are the original 
inhabitants of Canada. The term is similar to Aboriginal 
peoples. There are other words that Indigenous 
peoples may use to describe themselves and 
therefore, it is a good practice to ask how people wish 
to be named. It was Indigenous peoples themselves 
who choose this word at the United Nations level to 
best describe the original peoples of a territory.
Information and Communications Technology 
Council: a national centre for digital economy 
expertise.
Infrastructure Calgary (IC): an enterprise wide,  
cross-corporate team that provides governance  
and oversight of The City of Calgary’s Capital 
Infrastructure Investment Principles. IC provides 
intentional management of The City’s capital 
investment across all departments to strengthen 
decision-making and to maximize value for Calgarians. 
IC also works with the private sector and public 
institutions to align and optimize capital investments 
in order to foster social, environmental and economic 
value in the Calgary community.
Infrastructure Status Report (ISR): The City of 
Calgary corporate level document which includes 
business unit data. It reports on the overall state of 
City assets.

Integrated Watershed Management (IWM): is 
managing the interconnectedness between human 
activities and natural resources on a watershed 
basis, to create a resilient water future. IWM takes 
into account social, economic and environmental 
factors that influence protection of water resources 
when balancing the pressures of regional growth 
and climate change. This interconnectedness must 
be considered when working together to address the 
impacts of city-building on watershed management. 
‘In a Good Way’: is a concept used by many 
Indigenous peoples to recognize work that is 
conducted in an authentic and meaningful ways, 
with intention and sincerity, through reciprocal and 
respectful relationships. It is a demonstration of 
working with clear purpose and with high levels of 
integrity, moral strength and communal spirit (Source: 
U of C Indigenous Strategy).
Institutions: are formal, hierarchical organizations. 
They come in many organizational forms: for-profit, 
not-for-profit, and governmental, among others.
•  Examples of for-profit institutions include, but are 
not limited to: corporations, companies, banks and 
other financial institutions.

•  Examples of not-for-profit institutions include: 

registered charities, grassroots organizations, 
community associations, sports and recreation 
leagues, faith organizations.

•  Examples of governmental institutions include: all 
orders of government, justice system, schools and 
school boards, health care services, and political 
parties.

•  Other types of organizations include: post-

secondary institutions, think-tanks or research 
institutions, etc. 

Leadership Culture: are the values, beliefs, 
assumptions, interpretations, and biases that shape 
the direction and vision of communities  
and institutions.
Linking Social Capital: describes relationships among 
people or institutions at different levels of societal 
power, wealth or status.
Living Lab: the program where City infrastructure, 
data and other assets are made available to 
companies, researchers and individuals to test and try 
ideas and products in a real-life environment.

Appendix 1: Glossary

Resilient CalgaryLocalism: is a transfer of public service delivery 
(e.g. transit, healthcare, education, etc.) from 
local, provincial or federal governments to local 
communities.
Low Impact Development: is an approach to land 
development that uses various land planning and 
design practices and technologies to simultaneously 
conserve and protect natural resource systems 
and reduce infrastructure costs. (per Source Water 
Protection Plan)
Mental Models: habits of thought — deeply held 
beliefs and assumptions and taken-for-granted ways 
of operating that influence how we think, what we do, 
and how we talk.
Microaggressions: the everyday verbal, nonverbal, 
and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether 
intentional or unintentional, which communicate 
hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target 
persons based solely upon their marginalized  
group membership.
Municipal Natural Infrastructure: is the collection 
of resources, ranging from naturally occurring to 
engineered to mimic nature, that are relied upon 
by Calgarians, managed, or could be managed by 
The City of Calgary or regional partners, and that 
contribute to the provision of one or more municipal 
services and other resilience benefits. Some lines of 
service within The City of Calgary may have different 
or complementary definitions for operational and 
programming purposes. This definition created for 
the purposes of this report reflects the definition 
of “municipal natural assets (as) the stock of natural 
resources or ecosystems that is relied upon, managed, 
or could be managed by a municipality, regional 
district, or other form of local government for the 
sustainable provision of one or more municipal services” 
(Municipal Natural Assets Initiative 2017) and the 
Natural Infrastructure definition used by the Canadian 
Council of Ministers of the Environment (June 2018 
report, page 1) where Natural Infrastructure “refers 
to existing, restored, or enhanced combinations of 
vegetation and associated biology, land, and water, 
and their naturally occurring ecological processes that 
generate infrastructure outcomes such as preventing 
and mitigating floods, erosion and landslides, mitigating 
effects of extreme heat, and purifying groundwater. This 
is distinct from green infrastructure, which refers to any 
environmentally based infrastructure.” 

Natural Assets: a biotic (e.g. vegetation, fauna 
and other living organisms) or abiotic (e.g. soil, 
watercourses, atmosphere) item, thing or entity 
from which ecosystem services are derived, that has 
potential or actual value to an organization.
Operating Impact of New Capital (Incremental): 
the additional annual cost to operate and maintain 
new capital assets requested in 2019-2022. Operating 
Impact of Previously Approved Capital – the annual 
cost to operate and maintain capital assets previously 
approved in the 2015-2018 budgets but not in service 
until 2019 or later.
Opportunity Calgary Investment Fund (OCIF): 
The City of Calgary and its partners are supporting 
economic recovery and growth to help reduce the 
impact of the most recent economic downturn on 
citizens and businesses and to help ensure Calgary’s 
ongoing success into the future. As part of these 
efforts, Council created the $100-million Opportunity 
Calgary Investment Fund (OCIF), previously known as 
the Economic Development Investment Fund, and has 
established a wholly-owned subsidiary to manage its 
investments.
Preliminary Resilience Assessment: a Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment (PRA) describes the city profile, 
the main stresses and shocks in Calgary perceptions 
of stakeholders and the public and the inventory of 
actions already in place. The information was drawn 
from surveys, individual meetings, and workshops 
with diverse stakeholders. These results led to the 
identification of four recommended discovery areas 
that will serve as the basis for Calgary’s resilience 
strategy.
The PRA is a living document that summarizes the 
method and principal results of the activities carried 
out by the resilience team in Phase I of the strategy 
development process.
Participatory Democracy and Decision-Making: 
supports opportunity for all people to be meaningfully 
involved in economic, political, and social aspects of 
civic life. To be successful, participatory democracy 
and decision-making requires intentional relationships 
between institutions and individuals/communities that 
are built on trust and respect. Individuals and diverse 
communities can genuinely influence policies and 
programs that impact them.
Pluralistic Society: happens when different people  
or communities coexist. Different groups with  
varying interests, values, and beliefs are all  
considered legitimate.

Appendix 1: Glossary

126

Resilient CalgaryScenarios: are descriptions of plausible alternative 
futures. They paint a picture in the future of how 
Calgary evolved as it interacted with identified 
drivers of change. The objective of using scenarios 
for strategic foresight planning is NOT to predict 
the future. Scenarios are used to identify potential 
challenges and opportunities that could emerge. They 
also help develop robust strategies that may help cope 
with these challenges and opportunities.
Structural Racism: refers to the functioning of 
economic and social institutions through which 
racialized groups become systematically marginalized, 
discriminated and disadvantaged as those who form 
part of the dominant community assert their authority 
and power. Structural racism occurs regardless 
of individual prejudices, beliefs or intentions and 
encompasses both individual and institutional forms 
of racism. The norms, policies and practices set by the 
dominant group can prevent the equal participation 
of, deny opportunities to and/or create barriers for 
racialized groups.
Technology Giants: include Google, Apple, Amazon, 
Facebook, Netflix, Uber, etc.
Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN): 
is a five-part series to support the team’s learning of 
how to apply an equity lens to our work and advance 
equity in our organizations.
Watershed: watersheds include groundwater, springs, 
wetlands, ponds, streams and lakes as well as all 
land that drains into these linked aquatic systems. 
Watersheds reflect both the natural characteristics of 
their geography and the impacts of human activities 
within them. (per “Our BiodiverCity: Calgary’s 10-year 
biodiversity strategic plan”) http://www.calgary.ca/
CSPS/Parks/Documents/Planning-and-Operations/
BiodiverCity-strategic-plan.pdf

Polarized Society: happens when people or 
communities are extremely divided over particular 
political issues, policies, and/or people.
Policies: government, institutional and organizational 
rules, regulations, and priorities that guide the entity’s 
own and others’ actions.
Power Dynamics: the distribution of decision-making 
power, authority, and both formal and informal 
influence among individuals and organizations.
Public Service Delivery: refers to services which 
are typically provided by government, either directly 
or by financing provision of services. Services may 
include education, law enforcement, healthcare, social 
services, public transportation, urban planning, etc.
Practices: espoused activities of institutions, 
coalitions, networks, and other entities targeted to 
improving social and environmental progress. Also, 
within the entity, the procedures, guidelines, or 
informal shared habits that comprise their work.
Racialization: is the social process by which 
certain groups of people are singled out for 
unequal treatment on the basis of race and other 
characteristics, whether real or imagined. 
Reconciliation: means a shared and active process 
between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples 
to transform relationships and understandings by 
acknowledging what has happened in the past, 
addressing the impact of colonial policies and then 
following through with action.
Relationships & Connections: quality of connections 
and communication occurring among actors in the 
system, especially among those with differing histories 
and viewpoints.
Resilience: capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within a city 
to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of 
chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.
Resilience Dividend: a framework that can be used to 
estimate the net benefits of a resilience project.
Resource Flows: how money, people, knowledge, 
information, and other assets such as infrastructure are 
allocated and distributed.

Resilient CalgaryAppendix 5: Leveraging Existing Calgary Plans: Strategic Alignment to Council  
and Community Approved Documents
Our vision for Calgary is well established through imagineCALGARY. Fortunately, a wealth of existing and 
planned efforts also contribute to Calgary’s resilience. This strategy aims to build upon these to help shape 
future city plans. The Resilient Calgary strategy has been developed in conjunction with the following programs.
Age-Friendly (Seniors) Strategy presents a vision and principles for creating a more age-friendly Calgary, as 
well as population-level results, strategies, partners and proposed actions within each of six local priority areas 
ranging from access to information and services, housing, health, participation, prevention and response to Elder 
Abuse and transportation and mobility.
Business-Friendly Strategy (in development) The Business-Friendly Strategy will focus on improving and 
highlighting the municipal initiatives and actions to support businesses at each stage of the business cycle.

Calgary Corporate Accessibility Policy
This Council Policy provides a collective and coordinated approach to the inclusion of persons with disabilities 
and the accessibility of City programs and services. It will promote an environment in which all persons can 
participate in and contribute to the social, economic and political life in Calgary.

Calgary in the New Economy
The Economic Strategy for Calgary is a road map that directs collaborative economic development activities and 
establishes shared priorities with, and for, community stakeholders. It is a living document that sets direction 
and establishes priorities while evolving to adapt to changing times. Calgary has a well-deserved reputation for 
inclusion, entrepreneurship and community spirit and those values have influenced the development of  
the Strategy.

Calgary Transportation Plan
The Calgary Transportation Plan (CTP) provides policy direction on multiple aspects of the city’s transportation 
system. Successful application of the CTP policies will move Calgary towards a more sustainable future — for our 
economy, our environment and our citizens.

Centre City Plan Refresh
The Centre City Plan is a strategy document that provides the long-term vision, strategy and implementation 
actions for the Centre City.

Climate Resilience Strategy
Council approved the Climate Resilience Strategy on June 25, 2018. The Strategy provides the main direction for 
Climate Resiliency in Calgary. Included within the Strategy are the Action Plans for mitigation and adaptation to 
guide The City’s role and actions over the next ten years.
1.  The Climate Mitigation Action Plan identifies the actions of The City to ensure services, enabling activities, 

regulations and operations are provided to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy management 
and enable the low carbon economy. It includes five themes (buildings and energy systems, land use and 
transportation, consumption and waste, natural infrastructure and leadership) that cover the largest areas of 
impact for emissions and energy in Calgary.

2.  The Climate Adaptation Action Plan identifies the risks and vulnerabilities from severe weather events and 

identifies actions to manage the climate risks for Calgary in five themes (people, infrastructure, natural 
infrastructure, water management and governance). The plan helps us to respond to a changing climate by 
implementing risk management measures to reduce the impact of extreme weather events and climatic 
changes on infrastructure and services.

Resilient CalgaryCouncil Directives & Citizen Priorities
Council Directives include five priority areas — stemming from the imagineCalgary vision which will ensure 
Calgary remains a great place to make a living and a great place to make a life.
•  A Prosperous City – Calgary continues to grow as a magnet for talent, a place where there is opportunity for 

all and strives to be the best place in Canada to start and grow a business.

 •  A City of Safe and Inspiring Neighborhoods – Every Calgarian lives in a safe, mixed and inclusive 

neighborhood and has the right and opportunity to participate in civic life. All neighborhoods are desirable 
and have equitable public investments.

 •  A City That Moves – Calgary’s transportation network offers a variety of convenient, affordable, accessible 

and efficient transportation choices. It supports the safe and quick movement of people and goods 
throughout the city and provides services enabling Calgarians and businesses to benefit from connectivity 
within the city, throughout the region and around the globe.

 •  A Healthy and Green City – Calgary is a leader in caring about the health of the environment and promotes 

resilient neighborhoods where residents connect with one another and can live active, healthy lifestyles.

 •  A Well-Run City – Calgary has a modern and efficient municipal government that is focused on continuous 

improvement to make life better every day for Calgarians by learning from citizens, partners and others.

Gender Equity and Diversity Strategy
A dedicated, City of Calgary-wide strategy is under development to advance equity for diverse groups of 
women, men and gender-diverse people.

Industrial Land Strategy
Real Estate & Development Services (RE&DS) has developed a long-term Industrial Land Strategy for the 
development of City-owned lands. The strategy provides a framework for how The City will develop and  
service City-owned land with the goal of adding to Calgary’s economy and making our city a great place to  
work and live.

Integrated Watershed Planning Strategic Framework
The City of Calgary works to ensure we have a  healthy, resilient watershed capable of providing clean, reliable 
water for our current needs and future generations. The City is dedicated to implementing the Government of 
Alberta’s Water for Life Strategy through an integrated water management framework that ensures reliable and 
resilient water servicing for Calgary and regional customers. The City provides drinking water and wastewater 
treatment to about one in three Albertans. Working with the Province and regional partners, The City aims to 
protect the water supply, use water wisely, keep rivers healthy and build resiliency to flooding.

 Living Lab Strategy (in development)
A Living Lab strategy supports increased economic diversification and jobs for Calgarians. It can help 
entrepreneurs bring big ideas to fruition, support investment in our local economy and make Calgary more 
business friendly.

Municipal Development Plan
Calgary’s Municipal Development Plan and its accompanying maps were adopted by City Council in 2009. It 
contains policies that will shape how Calgary grows and develops over the next 30 to 60 years, and is built on 
seven interrelated goals. Calgary is expected to grow by another 1.3 million people over that time which makes 
it important that we plan for our future.

One Calgary
One Calgary was the name given to  The City of Calgary’s 2019-2022 Plans & Budgets. The 2019-2022 Plans and 
Budgets describe how we’re addressing ongoing challenges, providing essential services and delivering on 
Council’s vision for Calgary.

Appendix 5: Leveraging Existing Calgary Plans

Resilient CalgarySocial Well-Being Principles
In May 2018, Calgary City Council approved a set of Guiding Principles for Social Well-Being which states that The 
City will:
•      Strive to provide equitable services, including removing barriers to access and inclusion.
•      Advance the shared and active process of Truth and Reconciliation in collaboration with the community.
•      Seek opportunities to support and grow culture.
•      Aim to stop problems before they begin using a prevention approach.
These principles are intended to act as a foundation to inform how The City makes decisions and delivers 
services in a manner that meets the needs of all Calgarians. In addition, The City of Calgary established a  
Social Well-Being Advisory Committee in 2018 to provide advice on how The City can advance these principles  
in City services.

The City of Calgary’s Indigenous Policy
This policy guides meaningful long-term efforts  to bring Indigenous identities, histories, cultures, languages, 
traditions, principles, world views, relationships and ways of knowing into municipal planning, advising and 
decision-making efforts.

The City of Calgary Charter
City Charters are special legislative agreements that redefine the relationship between the Government of 
Alberta and the two biggest cities, Calgary and Edmonton.
The Municipal Government Act (MGA) governs all the municipalities in Alberta, from the smallest summer village 
(Betula Beach, population 10) to the largest cities (Edmonton, population 900,000 and Calgary, 1.2 million). While 
the MGA will continue to guide the majority of what Calgary and Edmonton do from day to day, the City Charters 
are specific to the needs of each of the two cities, their large-scale populations, and the large-scale challenges 
they face.
City Charters focus on some key policy areas amended to address the cities’ specific needs, aligning funding with 
responsibilities, and providing the flexibility needed to ensure Alberta’s two largest cities remain accountable to 
citizens and respond effectively to future challenges and opportunities.

Triple Bottom Line (TBL) Policy
The TBL policy reflects a greater awareness of the impacts of our decisions on the environment, society and the 
external economy — and how those impacts are related.

United Way of Calgary and Area: The Way Forward
As a social impact organization, United Way of Calgary and Area has set three foundational goals that  
will advance their mission to mobilize communities for lasting social change. (1) Deepening Community  
Impact (2) Inspire relationships and generate resources (3) Demonstrate excellence as a trusted high- 
performing organization.

The City of Calgary: Capital Infrastructure Investment Principles
With the development of One Calgary Service Plans and Budgets and following the 2019-2022 Council Directives 
that includes Council’s Five Guidelines to Administration, the revised Capital infrastructure Investment Principles 
provide greater alignment to The City’s shift toward service plans and budgets, and is intended to strategically 
better accommodate shocks and stresses through changing internal and external pressures. Intentional 
management of capital at The City will:
1.   Support the delivery of City of Calgary services, at approved service levels. Capital investments facilitate 
the delivery of services to residents. Services and service levels are defined by Council through the approval 
of multi-year service plans and budgets. The primary criteria for identifying, prioritizing and funding capital 
investments will be the need for capital to deliver services at approved service levels and the associated 
operating impact of this capital.

to promote the well-being of a community through improved connectivity, accessibility, inclusion,and 
environmental health as well as long-term resilience. The range of typical social, economic and 
environmental objectives accomplished through infrastructure investments includes benefits such as 
maintaining public safety and security, improving economic productivity, facilitating community cohesion, 
addressing risks and vulnerabilities for service providers, reducing the impact on climate change and 
enhancing public spaces and interactions within communities.

 3.  Build an adaptable, resilient and smart city. With adaptable and resilient infrastructure, The City can better 
manage risks and vulnerabilities to shocks and stresses. Resilient infrastructure is designed to ensure service 
delivery (meeting the needs of today while anticipating and not compromising the needs of tomorrow), 
adaptation (capacity to withstand disruption, both natural and man-made), community preparedness and 
financial strength. Infrastructure should also be designed to be resilient to the effects of climate change, and 
respect and help maintain ecological and biological diversity.
Smart cities utilize data innovation and technology to better inform decisions on service delivery, purpose 
and size of capital investments, economic development and resident empowerment and inclusion. Capital 
infrastructure planning and investments provide potential opportunities to explore, incubate, and potentially 
utilize innovative technologies, design, services and practices.

 

 4.  Enhance the long-term value of City assets. Capital planning and investment at The City requires a 

thorough appreciation of the long-term implications of service demand and asset needs, legal and regulatory 
provisions, technological trends, finance and asset ownership along with the integration of whole-of-life 
costing (i.e. asset acquisition, operation, maintenance and upgrades, and responsible disposal viewed 
through a single lens of asset stewardship). Capital planning and investment is necessary to deliver citizen-
facing services as well as supportive services (within The City’s control), to maximize the value to residents 
while minimizing service disruption, public safety and security risks, energy and environmental impacts and 
whole-of-life cost. Adopting industry-standard systematic asset management practices reduces legal and 
reputational risks to The City and improves accountability and transparency to the tax payer.
To maximize the value of The City’s previous and proposed capital investments, funding is required for the 
development of asset management plans addressing costs across the entire lifecycle (planning, building/ 
acquisition, operation, maintenance, evaluation and eventual disposal) and the prioritization of municipal 
capital investment to support intensification prior to the completion of communities in planned and/
or future greenfield areas. Maintaining the overall asset health is necessary to ensure The City’s ability to 
reliably and sustainably deliver Council-approved levels of service. Resources need be allocated to achieve 
an appropriate balance between the maintenance and renewal of existing infrastructure and the demand for 
new growth infrastructure.

 

 5.  Integrate, coordinate and optimize The City’s investment. Capital investments should be managed in 

a way which provides maximum value to the community. An integrated and coordinated approach to 
capital planning, prioritization and funding — administered at the corporate level — refines investments, 
identifies efficiencies and achieves economies of scale. Where possible, The City’s capital investments should 
contribute to multiple services and ensure continuity during times of normal use, emergency response and 
recovery. Regional benefits should also be considered.
Infrastructure investments may be coordinated or focused upon an identified investment need, support a 
service gap in the community, and/or contribute to alignment with external (i.e. private, provincial, federal) 
investment for a specific time. A directional investment focus may influence the corporate-level identification, 
prioritization and funding for capital investments.

 

  Council recognizes the need to embrace appropriate levels of risk, innovation and experimentation as 

opportunities to improve. Capital planning and investments create opportunities to explore and potentially 
make use of innovative technologies, design, services and practices.

to financing and funding will maximize The City’s opportunity to provide capital investments that support 
service delivery. Allocating the most restricted funding sources first, and switching accordingly (where 
permissible) to free up more flexible funding will enable The City to more effectively respond to current and 
emerging funding opportunities.
Focusing on long-term financial strategies, attracting private and other government investments and/or 
other alternative funding mechanisms (such as shared service delivery models and cost/revenue sharing 
mechanisms) creates the opportunity to realize greater economic and social value. Developing partnerships 
with external organizations to reach common goals for Calgarians will further promote entrepreneurship and 
investment within the city.
