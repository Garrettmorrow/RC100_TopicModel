RESILIENCE STRATEGY100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYDR. MIGUEL A. MANCERA ESPINOSA
Mayor of Mexico City 

TANYA MÜLLER GARCÍA
Secretary of the Environment

A Resiliency Strategy submitted by Mexico City was prepared under the 100 
Resilient Cities initiative, of which our city has been a member since 2013. This 
Resilience Strategy is a response to a global commitment by CDMX to foster 
public policies that contribute to strengthening Mexico City’s capacity to address 
various risks without without compromising our development.

As one of the greatest megacities in the world, Mexico City is an excellent center 
for the innovative proposals needed to improve its inhabitants’ quality of life. 
Building resilience must be tackled on multiple fronts. For example, the Water 
Fund for Mexico City aims to strengthen the water supply system and increase 
environmental protection of water conservation areas. Other projects are also 
contributing to the creation of resilience. For example, the Comprehensive 
Mobility Program is giving pedestrians and bicycle riders priority over private cars. 
A bus replacement project is removing old, obsolete, unsafe buses from our roads 
and fostering investment in up-to-date and safe transportation technologies, 
including electric cabs, which will help reduce pollutant emissions. And the Vision 
Zero initiative is reducing the number of road accidents.

Building resilience is in everyone’s interest. It is a short- and long-term endeavor 
that requires the participation and coordination of various stakeholders at the 
local and regional levels and from both the public and private sectors—from 
the outset and all through the implementation of the proposed actions. Public 
involvement is critical to building a community capable of facing the risks that 
all are exposed to, a community that can play an active role in responding to 
emergencies. Building resilience at all levels can help reduce social inequality 
and vulnerability, and produce a safer, fairer, and more equitable society.

Mexico City faces great challenges, some of which are connected with climate 
change, such as a decrease in the quantity and quality of environmental services 
available and an increase in extreme weather events. An example is the scarcity 
of water, which has become one of the most serious issues faced by a population 
already affected by the impacts of drought and the loss of green areas, which are 
causing a lower aquifer recharge zone in Conservation Areas.

Environmental policy has planning instruments such as ecological realignment 
of areas, which regulate development activities in order to preserve natural 
resources, improve people’s quality of life, and guarantee the water supply in the 
city. Nonetheless, the complexity of the challenges Mexico City faces requires the 
city to find new approaches to these challenges and to develop innovative solutions 
that result in multiple benefits and that support the CDMX sustainability agenda.

We have therefore developed a comprehensive public policy designed to counter 
the effects of climate change, as stated in the Mexico City Climate Action Program 
2014-2010 (PACCM). This policy brings various stakeholders together and fosters 
the coordination of actions to reduce social, environmental, and economic risks. 
Resilience building is a specific strategic focus of the PACCM that aims to develop 
and improve the adaptive capacity of Mexico City.

Resilience is a concept that spans all environmental issues. It involves multiple 
sectors of society and requires the integration of specific actions that are needed 
for urban renewal and a revitalized infrastructure. Resilience building can strengthen 
civil society and ensure that citizens at all levels of society have the ability to act 
in an emergency or disaster situation. 

Mexico City’s Resilience Strategy represents an opportunity to join together to 
support the economic and social development of the city, in harmony with the 
environment and with a vision for the future and our long-term commitments.

RESILIENCE STRATEGY100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYMICHAEL BERKOWITZ
President of 100 Resilient Cities, 
Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation.

ARNOLDO MATUS KRAMER
CDMX Chief Resilience Officer

100 Resilient Cities is honored to partner with Mexico City to support this important 
work and the release of this Resilience Strategy, which responds to the city’s 
most pressing shocks and stresses, such as flooding, limited mobility, and social 
inequity, and the need for better integrated regional planning.

The support and leadership of Mayor Mancera was crucial to the development of 
this strategy, and we are thrilled that the team is now taking steps to institutionalize 
the Resilience Office and implement the outlined initiatives. I would like to thank 
Tanya Müller Garcia, the Secretary of the Environment, without whose leadership 
and support this would not have been possible. In addition, I would like to highlight 
the work of the city’s Chief Resilience Officer, Arnoldo Matus Kramer, and his team, 
which includes Daniela Torres, Adriana Chavez, and Flavia Tudela, who laid the 
groundwork for this forward-thinking Resilience Strategy and hosted the 2015 
Chief Resilience Officer Global Summit, which offered the opportunity for high-
level stakeholders to engage in resilience thinking. 

The CDMX Resilience Strategy identifies five pillars and interrelated goals that 
are to guide the city-driven initiatives that will make the city stronger and more 
resilient. Featured in the strategy are initiatives that range from promoting better 
regional coordination to rethinking water management and flood protection. 

Finally, we should remind ourselves that the release of this strategy only represents 
the beginning of a long road for Mexico City. The strategy outlines a set of 
opportunities that must now be delivered on. 

We are thrilled to be continuing our work in Mexico City and to be supporting the 
work of the three other Mexican cities in our network. We look forward to seeing 
the implementation of this strategy’s initiatives with the support of an important 
and diverse set of actors from city agencies, local organizations, and the 100RC 
Platform of Partners, who have all rallied together to help create this strategy. 
 
Viva Mexico City!

Given its geographic location and social and economic context, Mexico City has 
faced many challenges and environmental impacts throughout its history. Today 
the citizens of Mexico City face such dynamically changing risks that we must 
create an environment of continuous learning and innovation to face present and 
future threats.

Our city is a living laboratory for new initiatives and technologies to build resilience 
from local to regional levels. At the local level, community development is vital to 
getting the public involved in building resilience and to increasing the public’s ability 
to face and respond to risks. At an urban level, successful, high-impact experiences 
must be shared and replicated in various areas, including at a regional level.

The Resilience Strategy is a living document, integrating best practices relating 
to key issues such as achieving aquifer sustainability or transforming the mobility 
system into city and regional planning. Issues such as these require the collaborative 
efforts of a coalition of stakeholders as well as the sustained, long-term support 
of human, technical, and financial resources. Therefore, the future creation of a 
Resilience Office for CDMX is an opportunity to strengthen this integration process 
and to track the projects and actions resulting from the Resilience Strategy.

RESILIENCE STRATEGY100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The vision of Mexico City (CDMX) is to create an equitable society based on an all-
embracing process in which various stakeholders, sectors, and vulnerable groups to 
survive the major challenges of the 21st century.

The city faces resilience challenges on environmental, social, and economic issues, 
given its geographic situation, history of great social-environmental transformation, 
and social context. Having once been a lake, the city has become a megacity, one of 
the most populous on Earth. Rapid urban expansion and soaring population growth 
in the last few decades have added to the problems resulting from insufficient long-
term planning and weak metropolitan coordination, making it difficult to monitor and 
track important regional issues such as water management based on a long-term 
sustainability perspective.

CDMX is faced with multiple risks, both natural and man-made. Although some of 
the most frequent impacts have been of hydrometeorological origin, geological 
phenomena, such as the 1985 earthquake, have caused the greatest economic and 
human losses. On a basis, there are other stresses that weaken the city, such as the 
inequality that exists at both a social and economic level as well as in the use of public 
space. For example, across the city, there is inequality of access to urban amenities 
and public services. Aquifer overexploitation is not just one of the most pressing 
and chronic issues affecting the future water supply for this region’s population, 
it is also a determining factor for seismic exposure, which can result in differential 
subsidence. Climate change may exacerbate risks and potentially increase the intensity 
of hydrometeorological events, causing historically unprecedented heat waves, extreme 
rainfall events, and long droughts.

In 2013, Mexico City was selected to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative by The 
Rockefeller Foundation. This initiative is an opportunity for cities to bring together 
their urban resilience building efforts and capabilities. The CDMX Resilience Strategy is 
being developed as part of this initiative, and to address the challenges facing the city 
through five pillars, or guiding principles. These pillars will drive the implementation 
of actions to improve the adaptive capacity, disaster response, and infrastructure 
development of CDMX.

PILLAR
01

FOSTER REGIONAL COORDINATION

Given the urban growth experienced by CDMX, resilience building must transcend 
political and administrative boundaries. Maintaining a regional view and coordination 
at all levels are key to building resilience, especially on priorities such as water and 
integrated mobility management. In the vision of this pillar, Megalopolis and the 
Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico (ZMVM) work together under a regional 
institutional framework on key issues to drive a common agenda and ensure shared 
responsibility in building resilience. Infrastructure projects with a regional impact, 
such as the New International Airport of Mexico City (NAICM) currently under 
development, are an opportunity to work more closely on resilience efforts and 
move toward a collaborative regional agenda. 

PILLAR
02 

PROMOTE WATER RESILIENCE AS A NEW PARADIGM TO 
MANAGE WATER IN THE MEXICO BASIN

A major resilience issue is linked to the future supply and management of water 
resources. The water management system has material inefficiencies; for example, 
there is a great loss of potable water due to leaks in the potable water distribution 
system. There is also great overexploitation of the aquifer. This overexploitation 
threatens the future supply of aquifer water for the metropolitan area, and it may 
be exacerbated by climate change, as there is a potential for a long drought. In 
the case of extreme rainfall events, ponding and floods may affect City operations, 
such as the mobility network. The vision for this pillar is that water in the Mexico 
Basin is handled under the Comprehensive Management of City Water Resources 
(GIRHU), which is responsible for the integrated management of urban water 
resources and the response to risks and impacts related to climate change and 
social and environmental pressures. The GIRHU must ensure equal access to the 
water supply and guarantee the water supply for the entire population.

12

PILLAR
03. 

PLAN FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL RESILIENCE

Urban and regional planning play a fundamental role in building resilience. The vision 
for this pillar is that CDMX citizens have equal access to urban amenities, housing, 
green areas, and public spaces, and that improvements in the environment and 
mitigation of risks occur through a sustainable management of natural resources. 
Planning is a fundamental tool for maintaining a long-term vision and for addressing 
current challenges on issues such as inequality, and for increasing resilience in the 
face of new challenges created by dynamic processes, such as climate change.

PILLAR
04. 

IMPROVE MOBILITY THROUGH AN INTEGRATED, 
SAFE, AND SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM

Mobility is one of the most pressing issues that must be addressed in order to 
improve quality of life in Mexico City. Today, the mobility system involves long 
commute times, loss of competitiveness, and impacts on health and social cohesion. 
Investment in public transportation is required in order to improve the quality 
and safety of the mobility system, as well as to create an integrated system that 
serves the entire population of the city. The vision of Pillar 04 is an integrated 
mobility system for CDMX and the ZMVM that gives priority to public transportation 
over private vehicles and provides a safe urban environment for pedestrians and 
bicyclists. In this vision, innovative transportation projects, technologies, and the 
smart use of data validate the benefits of improving mobility via an integrated, 
safe, and sustainable mobility system while discouraging the use of cars.

PILLAR 
05. 

DEVELOP INNOVATION AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY

This pillar has the goal of increasing the capacity of CDMX to respond to dynamic, 
changing risks of a natural or social origin without compromising economic 
competitiveness and sustainable development. To build resilience, innovative 
processes and tools must be developed that enable government and various social 
and economic sectors to be aware of and understand their vulnerabilities and 
reduce the risks they face, particularly with respect to climate change.

Finally, for a successful implementation of the Resilience Strategy, a Resilience Office 
for CDMX must be established, as cities such as Barcelona, New York City, and New 
Orleans, among others, have done. The Resilience Office must be all-embracing and 
flexible enough to coordinate the efforts of government stakeholders at various 
levels (city, region, and country), as well as stakeholders in civil society, the private 
sector, and the scientific community. The Resilience Office must also take charge of 
co-designing a tracking system that facilitates continuous learning and innovation 
to build resilience in CDMX.

RESILIENCE STRATEGY100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYI

INTRODUCTION

Resilience refers to the capacity of the individuals, communities, enterprises, and 
systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow, notwithstanding the chronic 
stresses and acute impacts[1]  experienced.

In 2013, Mexico City (CDMX) was selected 
to  be  part  of  the  100  Resilient  Cities 
(100RC)  initiative,  pioneered  by  The 
Rockefeller Foundation, which seeks to 
help prepare cities to build urban resilience 
around the social, economic, and physical 
challenges of the 21st century (Figure 1).[2] 

The  100RC  initiative  supports  cities 
by  financing  and  providing  technical 
assistance, access to the services of global 
organizations, opportunities to exchange 
experiences and best practices among 
member cities, and access to tools for 
building resilience.

Wave 3

The Government of Mexico City views 
participation in the 100RC initiative as 
an  opportunity  to  share  experiences 
and learn from other cities in the global 

community  and  to  build  resilience  to 
the chronic stresses and acute impacts 
associated  with  climate  change  and 
natural and man-made disasters.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER I.  INTRODUCTIONRESILIENCE CHALLENGES IN CDMX

Over time Mexico City has experienced 
a  great  social  and  environmental 
transformation, becoming the center of 
economic, political, and social-cultural 
activities in Mexico. A strong trend of 
population  growth  and  expansion  of 
its territory have given rise to pressing 
issues,  such  as  intense  demand  for 
natural resources, inequality and social 
marginalization,  informal  settlements, 
waste generation, degradation of natural 
resources, and pollution. 

These  issues,  however,  have  also 
generated  a  strong  link  between  the 
Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico 
(ZMVM)[3] and the Megalópolis,[4] due to 

intense collaboration and integration at 
urban, socioeconomic, and environmental 
levels in the region. 

To  build  resiliency,  the  past  must  be 
considered so that risks related with the 
city’s history are better understood. For 
example, while the fact that most of the 
City is located on top of what used to be a 
lake must be considered, future scenarios 
must  take  into  account  the  fact  that 
social and environmental transformation 
continues  to  take  place.    Knowledge 
of both the past and the present is the 
foundation for a better understanding of 
the potential risks and unforeseen events 
that the City and its inhabitants may face.

2.1. THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION FROM LAKE TO MEGACITY

Mexico City is built on what used to be a 
lake, inside a drainless basin.[5] From pre-
Colombian times, hydraulic projects took 
place to manage and control the lake’s 
water level during rainy seasons, mitigate 
floods, and avoid mixing the salty water 
of Texcoco Lake with fresh water from 
the surrounding lakes.

These projects enabled a steady supply 
of water to the city’s inhabitants. Altering 
lake systems defined a new relationship 
with the basin and created an acute water 
stress due to pressure for water resources 
from one of the world’s most populated 
megacities (Figure 3).

3. ZMVM includes 16 Boroughs of CDMX (42 percent of the population), 59 municipalities of the State of Mexico (53 percent 

of the population) and 21 municipalities of Hidalgo State (5 percent of the population) (PUEC, 2012).

4. CDMX is located in a megalopolitan area in the central part of the country, which includes: CDMX, the State of Mexico, 

Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Morelos, and Puebla. The 16 boroughs of CDMX, 29 municipalities of Hidalgo State, 80 municipalities of the 

State of Mexico, 33 municipalities of Morelos State, 22 municipalities of Puebla State, and the 60 municipalities of Tlaxcala 

State are represented in Megalopolis (in total, 16 boroughs and 224 municipalities [DOF, 2013]). As of 2010, Megalopolis had 

29 million inhabitants, representing 29 percent of the total population of the country, concentrated in 4.4 percent of Mexican 

territory (INEGI, 2010).

5. Drainless basin: area of rainwater drainage where water flows without an exit to the ocean (World Bank, 2013a).

2010

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, giant 
drains, pits, and tunnels were built as flood 
protection, draining the lakes and carrying 
excess rainfall water out of the Valley of 
Mexico Basin. This type of flood protection 
ended with the construction of the “Great 
Sewage Canal.”[7] During the 1960s, 80 
kilometers of rivers were covered and 
replaced with roads, a development that 
reflected the thinking of the times but 
resulted in a host of water-related issues. 

Population growth increased demand for 
this vital resource, which is why new, huge 
hydraulic works were built at a regional 
level. Lerma System, which opened in 1952 
and expanded in 1976 with the Cutzamala 
System, was built to import water from 
neighboring basins,[8] while new projects, 
such as the deep sewage system that was 
completed by 1975,[9] were built to drain 
gray water out of the Valley of Mexico 
Basin.

Despite these projects, the water system 
has limited capacity and its sustainability 
is a huge challenge. Water losses of about 
41.4 percent due to leaks from the potable 
water system are estimated, and reuse 
and water treatment systems are limited.[10]

To face these challenges, some important 
projects currently under construction are 
aiming to address the future functioning 
of the hydraulic system of the Valley of 
the Mexico Basin.[11]

2.2. CITY EXPANSION

In  the  20th  century,  economic  and 
demographic  growth,  augmented  by 
migration from rural areas to the City, 
have resulted in enormous changes to 
the urban environment and in physical 
conurbation with ZMVM. Urban sprawl 
has spread, mainly to the northern and 
eastern parts of the city.

Beginning  in  the  1990s,  the  greatest 
growth occurred in the northern part of 
the city, in the municipalities of the State 
of  Mexico,  in  the  central  boroughs  of 
CDMX, and in the Conservation Areas[12] 
(Figure 4). This growth has caused serious 
degradation of the strategic environmental 
services that are meant to benefit people 
living and working in the city, such as 
aquifer recharge, biodiversity, and carbon 
uptake. In addition, population growth 
has resulted in informal settlements on 
hillsides with steep or unstable slopes, in 
flood prone areas, and in areas that are 
critical for aquifer recharge[13]  (Figure 5). 

Starting  in  1980,  large  investments  in 
areas such as Santa Fe, which is west 
of the city, led to urban development. 

Insufficient urban planning for these areas 
has created significant mobility issues. 
The lack of planning has not only made 
CDMX one of the cities with the greatest 
traffic congestion in the world,[14] but has 
impacted the quality of life of thousands 
of inhabitants. Traffic issues are related 
to  job  distribution,  and  employment 
is concentrated in the central areas of 
ZMVM; only four of the city boroughs 
provide one-third of the employment at 
the metropolitan level[15] (Figure 6).

An estimated 4.5 million people commute 
daily to CDMX from the metropolitan area, 
primarily from the municipalities of the 
State of Mexico. This daily influx increases 
the  demand  on  public  transportation 
systems  and  traffic  on  the  city’s  road 
network.[16]  Reducing  commute  times 
between the places where people live and 
work by enhancing and expanding public 
transportation services is an enormous 
challenge.

In  addition,  transportation  is  the 
greatest source of pollution in ZMVM, 
generating an estimated 46 percent of 
the polluting emissions (ozone precursors 
and  particles)  in  ZMVM.[17]  Private 
transportation  generates  most  of  the 
ozone  particulates,[18] and  after  diesel, 
heavy transportation is the second-highest 
source of fine particulate emissions.[19] 
ZMVM’s 5 million vehicles, with an annual 
growth rate of 3.8 percent, are one of 
the main causes of the emissions that 
impact air quality[20] in the city and the 
metropolitan area. 

Megacities have ever-expanding needs 
for public services and amenities. These 
needs make city and regional planning 
more  complex  and  demand  greater 
coordination  at  the  metropolitan  and 
regional levels as well as require important 
financial,  human,  and  technological 
resources to address a broad spectrum 
of present and future challenges.

2.3. SHOCKS AND STRESSES IN CDMX

Building resilience at city and regional 
levels  depends  heavily  on  assessing 
vulnerabilities  and  historical  impacts, 
understanding and interpreting future risk 
scenarios (for example, climate change 

scenarios), as well as understanding the 
socioeconomic  and  social-ecological 
processes that increase the vulnerabilities 
caused by the city’s chronic stresses.

SHOCKS

CDMX  is  vulnerable  to  many  risks  of 
natural  and  human  origin  due  to  its 
geographic location and socioeconomic 
situation. In recent times, the city has been 
affected by various natural disasters, such 
as earthquakes, floods, and epidemics.

Figure 7 shows the impacts of three types 
of shocks in terms of population affected 
and direct economic costs during the 
period from 1980 to 2013.

As previously stated, some of the identified 
shocks are related directly or indirectly 
with hydrometeorologic phenomena. On 
the other hand, social conflict is perceived 
as a high to medium-high risk given the 
frequency with which it occurs in the city; 
for example, in 2014, 97 demonstrations 
took place in the city, resulting in losses 
totaling 1,945.5 million pesos [25]. Similarly, 
a  severe  social  conflict  may  put  the 
provision of vital city services and the 
maintenance of strategic infrastructure, 
such as the public transportation system 
and the main network of roads, at great 
risk.

Earthquakes were also considered a high 
to medium-high risk in all three exercises. 
Potential catastrophic events, such as 
the 1985 earthquake that caused serious 
damage to the city, were rated according 
to severity. 

Figure 9 shows a seismic risk map with 
Expected  Annual  Loss  (PAE)[26]  per 
neighborhood of losses corresponding 
to a typical portfolio of properties insured 
in CDMX. However, earthquakes are only 
one of those geologic risks to which the 
city is exposed.

Figure 8. Summary of the perception of shocks in CDMX [24]

The highest direct economic costs stem 
from damage during the 1985 earthquake. 
However,  hydrometeorologic  shocks 
have had more frequent impacts on the 
population; during the period from 1980 
to 2013, more people were affected by 
hydrometeorologic  shocks  than  were 
affected by the 1985 earthquake. Other 
shocks include heavy rains that can cause 
floods and destabilize hillsides; hail; heat 
waves; and strong winds that can damage 
infrastructure  and  cause  buildings  to 
collapse. Under climate change conditions, 
extreme hydrometeorologic events are 
expected to occur more frequently and 
with greater intensity in the city and the 
region,[21] as detailed below.

Figure 8 summarizes the results from three 
exercises conducted during the strategy 
development portion of the Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment. The first exercise 
revealed how stakeholders from various 
sectors perceived the main asset impacts, 
shocks,  and  stresses  identified  during 
the workshop.[22] The second and third 
exercises presented the main shocks to 
the city, which were based on the views 
of stakeholders in the construction and 
insurance sectors.[23]

22.  Perceptions related to shocks and stresses are the result of a workshop held on May 26, 2015, during Phase 1 of the 

Resilience Strategy development. Workshop attendees were government officers and representatives from the private sector, 

non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the scientific community.

Figure 10. 1985 EARTHQUAKE 

The 1985 earthquake, which caused heavy human and economic losses, was the 
most serious disaster in CDMX’s recent history. The reconstruction costs were a 
great challenge for the city and the country[27]. Estimates of damages from this 
earthquake vary significantly by source because most were created without a 
uniform methodology and were based on scattered, incomplete information:

HUMAN LOSSES

Official data on fatalities vary between 6,000 (CENAPRED, 2001) and 8,000 
(CEPAL, 1985)[28].

COSTS DUE TO DAMAGES AND LOSSES

Estimated costs range from $USD 4.1 million  (CENAPRED, 2001) to 
$USD 8.3 billion (World Bank, 2012).

Affected over 2.7% of the national GDP  in 1985. (CENAPRED, 2001).

INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGES (CENAPRED, 2001)

36,000 homes destroyed

65,000 homes with serious damage.

3,300 large buildings damaged.

1 out of 5 teaching facilities collapsed or damaged beyond repair.

50 hospitals and health care centers damaged.

Considerable damages to the water supply, power and telecommunications networks.

SOCIAL IMPACT

30,000   people injured (World Bank, 2012b).

250,000 people with lost their homes (World Bank, 2012b).

900,000 people with damage to their homes (World Bank, 2012b).

150,000 unemployed people (CENAPRED, 2001).

There could be another disaster if another large-magnitude earthquake occurs. 
Continuous resilience building is key to protecting human lives, housing, strategic 
infrastructure, basic services such as potable water and sewage networks, the food 
supply, and the city’s transportation network.

27. CENAPRED, 2001; World Bank, 2012b; OCDE, 2013.

28. Some non-official estimates provided were much higher for human losses: Semanario Proceso (Proceso Weekly Magazine, 

2015) published non-official figures of 25,000 to 30,000 fatalities; the Excelsior newspaper published figures based on data 

from the Mexico City Civil Registry Office stating that there were 12,843 victims (Paramo, September 15, 2015).

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER II.  RESILIENCE CHALLENGESthe basin’s soil types and overexploitation 
of the aquifer cause serious subsidence 
in the city, which affects infrastructure 
and housing, and also creates a dynamic 
vulnerability  to  a  large-magnitude 
earthquake.[30]

In addition to earthquakes, the exposure 
of CDMX to various geologic risks such 
as hillside movement, subsidence, and 
volcanic events is great.[29] The city is 
located on what is known as the “Ring 
of Fire,” where 80 percent of the world’s 
seismic activity takes place, as well as on 
the country’s volcanic range, where nine 
active volcanoes are located. Features of 

STRESSES

CDMX faces important stresses. Some 
of the most relevant were identified in a 
public outreach process with stakeholders 
from  various  sectors,  and  they  were 
classified by their perceived level of risk 
(Figure 11).

Inequality,  poverty,  and  wealth 
concentration are acknowledged as the 
main  stresses,  with  a  medium  to  high 
risk for the city. There is a high level of 
inequality in the city, which has a Gini 
coefficient of 0.507.[31]

Figure 11. Stress perception chart (2015)

Poverty
28.4% of the population lives 
in poverty (Coneval, 2014).

Wealth concentration
44.90% of CDMX's GDP is produced in 
the Miguel Hidalgo and Cuauhtemoc 
boroughs (SEDUVI, 2015a).

This is clearly reflected at a basic level, 
given that there is inequality in people’s 
access to services, urban amenities, and 
quality housing between the eastern and 
western areas of the city as well as the 
outer areas of ZMVM.

of  intergovernmental  agreements  for 
regional  coordination  on  key  issues, 
such as mobility, protection of natural 
resources, and water management, result 
in negative impacts to the quality of life of 
those who live and work in ZMVM.

Vulnerability to specific impacts varies, 
given  that  the  capacity  of  people  to 
respond  to  severe  shocks  and  acute 
stresses varies from district to district. 
Nevertheless, CDMX is the second area in 
the country with the lowest poverty rate, 
with 28.5 percent of the population living 
in poverty and 2.2 percent, in extreme 
poverty.[32]  

Weak metropolitan coordination and the 
expansion of urban sprawl are stresses 
that  strongly  relate  to  metropolitan 
governance.  The  Organization  for 
Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD)[33]  recognizes that the lack of 
a metropolitan view and the weakness 

There  are  socioeconomic  and  social-
ecological  processes  driving  city  and 
regional vulnerability. Among those are: 
1) historic population growth and urban 
sprawl,  2)  weak  urban  planning  and 
regional coordination, 3) degradation of 
strategic environmental services for the 
city’s inhabitants, and 4) poverty and 
inequality  clearly  expressed  in  access 
to  housing  and  urban  amenities,  and 
the status of vulnerable populations. All 
these stresses will be exacerbated by 
climate change. These processes must 
be understood if the city is to step up 
and adapt to the challenges they present.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER II.  RESILIENCE CHALLENGESLOSS OF THE PRODUCTIVE BASE 2.4. CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate change poses risks to both human 
and natural systems in the 21st century. 
The 2014 report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides 
conclusive evidence regarding potential 
shocks  and  their  consequences  for 
megacities such as CDMX. An increase 
in the intensity and frequency of extreme 
weather events is expected, and these 
events  may  include  severe  floods, 
droughts,  heat  waves,  and  landslides 
(Figures 12 and 13).[34]

For CDMX, climate change scenarios show 
an  increase  of  average  temperatures 
within  a  range  of  0.5  to  1.25  degrees 
Celsius (°C) for colder months (December 
to February) in the short term (2030) and 
up to 2°C in the medium term (2050). 
For warmer months (April to June), an 

Figure 12.  Rainfall predictions for CDMX[37]

increase  of  1.25  to  1.50°C  in  the  short 
term is foreseen, and up to 2.25°C in the 
medium term.[35] 

Mexico  City  Climate  Action  Program 
(PACCM) 2014-2020[36]  states that about 
5.6 million people in the city are vulnerable 
to climate change and describes their 
economic and educational status, gender 
distribution,  degree  of  dependence, 
geographic location, and other factors.

One of the expected shocks associated 
with  climate  change  is  an  increase  in 
extreme  rainfall  that  may  result  in  an 
increased number of floods. Shocks to 
sewage systems are projected during 
intense rainfall seasons, and the frequency 
and extent of such shocks may increase 
significantly due to lack of infrastructure 
maintenance  or  as  a  result  of  future 
earthquakes, which may result in damaged 
infrastructure in the city.[38]
 
Some of the most recurrent shocks in 
CDMX are the ponding of water and the 
floods that occur during the rainy season 
(May to August). Figure 14 shows areas 
in danger of flooding in CDMX. Although 
they only result in minor direct economic 
impacts, they severely affect mobility in 
the city and the entire metropolitan area 

and in doing so result in significant indirect 
economic losses.

Flooding  due  to  the  collapse  of  the 
sewage  system  affects  both  the  area 
near the current Mexico City International 
Airport (AICM) and the area where the 
New  International  Airport  of  Mexico 
City  (NAICM)  is  being  constructed.[39] 
Therefore, to increase the resilience of 
both  CDMX  and  ZMVM,  actions  that 
improve  the  use  and  management  of 
water  resources  and  address  climate 
change  scenarios  involving  extreme 
rainfall are needed.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER II.  RESILIENCE CHALLENGESDROUGHT

Another  potential  shock  for  the  city 
that  may  result  from  climate  change 
is  a  prolonged  drought  in  the  region 
that affects the Cutzamala system and 
therefore the water supply to ZMVM. From 
2009 to 2011, a drought in northern and 
central Mexico impacted the availability 
of potable water for some areas of the 
city (specifically, Iztapalapa and Tlahuac) 
(Figure 15). After a number of tropical 
storms, the effects of the drought receded 
and adequate water levels in the reservoirs 
supplying the city and the metropolitan 
area were reestablished.[40]

of Mexico. Estimates are that in about 30 
to 40 years the Mexico Basin will gradually 
become impaired and will cease to be the 
main water source for CDMX. If extended 
droughts like those in Sao Paulo, Brazil, 
or in California, United States, were to 
occur in northern and central Mexico, 
sustainable aquifer management will be 
critical for water supply and resilience for 
the megacity and the region. 

PROLONGED DROUGHT CASE STUDY: LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A.

Since 2012, California has experienced a historic drought (Figure 16). In January 2014, 
dams and rivers registered their lowest levels in history, and the state was declared 
to be in a state of emergency. The eastern Sierra Nevada, a region that supplies 
water to the city of Los Angeles, registered snow coverage that was 2 percent of 
normal, the lowest level in history.[41] Although 2015–2016 was expected to be a year 
with much rainfall due to the presence of El Niño, drought conditions still prevailed 
in almost all the state.[42]

WATER CONSERVATION

In April 2015, California’s governor, Jerry Brown, issued an executive order to reduce 
use of potable water in urban areas by 25 percent, with specific reductions of 4 to 36 
percent required for cities (relative to 2013 usage).[44] The specific reduction required 
for the City of Los Angeles was 16 percent. However, water pressures in the city in 
previous years had forced local government to act. In October 2014, Eric Garcetti, 
mayor of Los Angeles, made a commitment to reduce water consumption per capita 
by 20 percent by 2017 and to realize a partial reduction of 10 percent by mid-2015. 
He also endeavored to reduce water imports by 50 percent by 2025 and replace 
this reduction by rainfall capture by 2035. [45] About 65 percent of the water in Los 
Angeles is used in homes. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) 
explains that it achieved its water consumption reduction goal by July 2015 as the 
result of the stringent restrictions it imposed on the use of water for gardening.[46]

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER II.  RESILIENCE CHALLENGESINVESTMENT IN LOCAL WATER SOURCES

Los Angeles seeks to develop local water sources that are drought-resilient. Between 
2011 and 2015, 80 percent of the water used in Los Angeles was imported from the 
Sierra Nevada and the Colorado River. Due to impacts of climate change on these 
sources, Los Angeles is seeking new projects to recycle water and capture rainfall. 
Alternatives are also being investigated to recharge the San Fernando Valley aquifer 
with treated recycled water.[47]

ECONOMIC IMPACT

Droughts have a significant impact on the agricultural sector, and these impacts create 
economic losses.[48] However, in the city the economic importance of the agricultural 
sector is relatively small,[49]  and the industrial and commercial sectors, which tend 
to predominate in cities, are not directly affected by drought.[50] In Los Angeles, 
homeowners have experienced the greatest economic impacts of the drought because 
of rate increases.[51] However, LADWP has also been affected: Restrictions on water 
consumption reduce revenues for LADWP even though the transaction costs of the 
water system have been fixed.

3.1 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR CITY RESILIENCE

In  the  last  few  years,  the  Mexico  City 
Government has implemented strategies, 
programs,  and  projects  to  address 
resilience issues in various sectors (Figure 
17). These actions have provided a basis 
for the implementing comprehensive risk 
management,  development  planning, 
and  institutional  responses  to  climate 
change as priorities to CDMX and have 
contributed to building resilience.

The Mexico City Climate Action Program 
2014–2020 prioritizes building resilience 
at both the city and the societal level and 
focuses on reducing the vulnerability of 
people in poverty, as they are often the 
most vulnerable to these events, given the 
degree to which their quality of life and 
basic goods (home, health, education) are 
affected by such events. The Resilience 
Strategy  seeks  to  strengthen  city 
programs and projects designed to build 
resilience.

The CRF is a tool that the Rockefeller 
Foundation developed in collaboration 
with Arup[52]  to identify the features of a 
resilient city (Figure 18). The goal of the 
CRF is to identify the ways that cities 
around the world can assess and analyze 
resilience in a more uniform way. The CRF 
also helps compare and contrast resilience 
among the various cities involved in the 
100RC initiative.

Vejle’s approach to resilience

to inform the methodology for design 
and collection of data and perceptions 
from stakeholders. With this strategy, 
the main results for the shocks, stresses, 
strengths, and weaknesses of a city could 
be illustrated as they relate to resilience.

Also guiding the design of the Resilience 
Strategy are the seven qualities described 
in the table on the following page.

The CRF tool is made up of 4 dimensions, 
12 drivers, and 50 sub-drivers that help 
to articulate the process that cities use 
to assess their capacities connected to  
resilience building (Figure 18). 
The CRF was used to develop a strategy 

” URBAN RESILIENCE IS THE CAPACITY 
OF INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, 
INSTITUTIONS, BUSINESSES, AND 
SYSTEMS WITHIN A CITY TO SURVIVE, 
ADAPT, AND GROW NO MATTER WHAT 
KINDS OF CHRONIC STRESSES AND 
ACUTE SHOCKS THEY EXPERIENCE.”

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER III.  DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE STRATEGYRESILIENCE QUALITIES

INCLUSIVE

INTEGRATED

The Resilience Strategy process should attract a wide, diverse group 
of stakeholders, including those that are most vulnerable to shocks 
and stresses, to ensure transparency and collective responsibility. 
Methods to encourage commitment should reflect opportunities for 
collective cooperation to help ensure that the strategy results in an 
approach that considers and sets priorities for the resilience needs of 
various sectors and groups of stakeholders. The Resilience Strategy 
should also be clearly organized and documented to guarantee that 
all stakeholders understand and have access to it.

The  Resilience  Strategy  process  and  results  should  be  built  on 
continuous supplemental efforts. Instead of creating additional work 
and conflict for stakeholders, the strategy should be developed to help 
cities to align with and make the best of existing and new initiatives 
and priorities. The strategy should also ensure management of the 
relationship between and interdependence of initiatives and the risks 
to be addressed.

ROBUST

The Resilience Strategy should be developed from a clear, rigorous 
process that brings together commonly accepted quantitative and 
qualitative approaches. 100RC should provide best practices to guide 
the development of the strategy.

RESOURCEFUL

The  Resilience  Strategy  should  take  into  account  city  resource 
restrictions and should seek innovative options to overcome them.

REFLECTIVE

The Resilience Strategy should be designed to capture lessons learned, 
new or updated information, reevaluations, and constant change. 
Mechanisms should allow for ongoing evolution; cities should be able 
to make decisions based on historical experiences and information 
and in real time.

REDUNDANT

The Resilience Strategy should have multiple initiatives to ensure 
that cities have redundant capacities to address the various needs 
of resilience.

FLEXIBLE

The Resilience Strategy should have the flexibility to adapt to events 
and unforeseen changes in context and new perils, situations, data and 
stakeholders. The strategy should provide an adaptive management 
cycle that takes into account successes and failures, best practices, 
experiences, and approaches, both internally and in other cities. 
Such inputs should be periodically reevaluated to reinforce strategic 
priorities and adjust implementation approaches.

46

3.2 STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

The preparation of a Resilience Strategy 
in the 100RC Network follows a consistent 
methodology through three phases of 
work that started in March 2015 (Figure 19). 
The strategy development process was a 
participatory process that approached 
and consulted with stakeholders in the 
public sector, the private sector, non-
governmental  organizations,  and  the 
scientific community to ensure inclusion 
of various perspectives, priorities, and 
information  sources.  All  stakeholders 
provided  valuable  information  that 
contributed  to  an  exchange  of  local 
knowledge and the creation of resilience 
priorities that must be addressed.

During  Phase  I,  participants  reviewed 
government documents and literature and 

conducted semi-structured interviews, 
surveys, workshops, and meetings with 
subject-matter experts to identify and 
understand the main stresses, shocks, 
and assets of the cit[53]. The information 
was presented in a Preliminary Resilience 
Evaluation, which identified six focal areas. 
These  six  areas  were  studied  in  more 
depth in Phase II.

During Phase II, work groups consisting 
of subject-matter experts from various 
sectors were established to develop the 
issues and areas of opportunity specific 
to the six focal areas.[54]

53. During Phase I, 11 interviews, 17 surveys, and 2 workshops were conducted (a Perceptions workshop with 20 attendees and 

an Assets, Stresses, and Shocks workshop with 27 attendees); 146 individuals and 290 actions were identified as contributing 

to resilience development in CDMX.

54. During Phase II, three workshops were conducted and working sessions with the responsible parties for each work group 

47

were held.

CHAPTER III.  DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE STRATEGY100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYBy combining the results of Phases I and II, weaknesses, areas of opportunities, the 
relationship between shocks and stresses, and the actions that should be fostered 
to address the main resilience challenges faced by CDMX were identified. From this 
process, it was determined that five pillars needed to be considered:

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER III.  DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE STRATEGYWORLD SUMMIT ON RESILIENCE

COP 21

In November 2015, CDMX hosted the Second Global Summit of Resilience Directors. 
Participants included resilience directors from about 50 cities from around the world, 
100RC global initiative staff, and 100RC Platform Partners members. The objective of the 
summit was to share experience about the initiatives taken, the barriers encountered, 
and the solutions that overcame the barriers in the cities in the 100RC Network. The 
summit also highlighted how resilience directors from around the world have come 
to lead construction efforts.

During the event, CDMX served as a living laboratory where participants experienced 
diverse resilience challenges and observed how the city has fostered innovative 
initiatives to address its challenges and needs. The Mayor, heads and officers of various 
CDMX government secretariats, Resilience Directors from various cities around the 
world, and representatives of international organizations took part in this event.

During the summit, participants discussed the resilience challenges posed by the current 
Mexico City International Airport and brought their diverse experience and points of 
view to the subject. Topics addressed included ways to incorporate resilience elements 
into the project in the context of the needs of the population and the city’s chronic 
stresses and acute shocks. Participants also identified key topics that should be taken 
into account in the project, including social inclusion, comprehensive mobility, water 
management, seismic risk management, and opportunities to reduce social inequality.

In December 2015, during the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France, the CDMX 
government presented a paper entitled The View of Mexico City on Climate Change 
to 2025 e[55]. The paper discussed the progress that the city has made on climate 
policy and its vision for 2025 on mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. The paper 
also highlights a preliminary vision of a Resilience Strategy to reduce vulnerability in 
the face of social, economic, and environmental threats. The inclusion of resilience 
in this paper illustrated CDMX’s commitment to strengthen city resilience and to be 
a global leader on this issue.

EXPERIENCE EXCHANGE AMONG RESILIENCE DIRECTORS 
IN ROTTERDAM

From October 5 to 9, 2015, an exchange of resilience ideas and experience took place 
under 100RC auspices in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The exchange focused on 
identifying best practices by cities to manage water resources and build resilience. 
Resilience Directors and officers from Bangkok (Thailand); Berkeley, CA (USA); 
Mexico City (Mexico); New Orleans, LA (USA); Norfolk, VA (USA); Rome (Italy); 
Rotterdam; Surat (India); and Vejle (Denmark) attended the exchange. These cities face 
common challenges regarding water management. During the exchange, innovations 
implemented in Rotterdam for multidisciplinary infrastructure were explored. Among 
the innovations were water squares and underground parking lots that can retain 
and store water during intense rainfall events to mitigate the risk of floods while 
providing public space.[56]

were from private organizations, NGOs, universities and colleges, and the 100RC Partners Platform. After the exchange, a 

document with recommendations was prepared. This document is available at: http://www.100resilientcities.org/blog/entry/

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER III.  DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE STRATEGYThe CDMX commitment to implement actions to build a Resilience Strategy has been 
demonstrated by the signing of a 100RC commitment declaration that states that the 
city will allocate 10 percent of its annual budget to support resilience measures in the 
city. As a result of this commitment, 100RC ensured financing of up to $USD 5 million 
for Platform Partners services until 2020 to support the city’s efforts to build resilience.

The commitment declaration was signed by Dr. Miguel Angel Mancera, the Mayor 
of Mexico City, during the 100RC-sponsored Second Global Summit of Resilience 
Directors. With this agreement, the mayor requested that the activities that are 
developed as part of this initiative be monitored.

ARISE INITIATIVE

CDMX has been chosen to be part of the ARISE Initiative for Private-Sector Alliance 
for Resilient Societies before Disasters. This initiative, which is promoted by United 
Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), is designed to foster collaboration 
with private-sector entities to build city resilience. ARISE initiative activities have been 
integrated into the CDMX Resilience Strategy.

3.3 INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF RESILIENCE

The development and implementation of the Resilience Strategy has been driven 
by the Resilience Steering Committee, which was created under the mandate of the 
Federal District Inter-Institutional Climate Change Commission (CICCDF)[57], pursuant 
to Article 11, Fraction XIII of the Federal District Act for Climate Change Mitigation and 
Adaptation and Sustainable Development. The Resilience Steering Committee is made 
up of a group of stakeholders who represent various sectors (Figure 20) and have 
contributed to the development of the Resilience Strategy with review and validation 
of documents, activities, and strategy design in preparation for submittal to CICCDF.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER IV.  A VISION TO BUILD RESILIENCE IN CDMXIV. A VISION TO BUILD RESILIENCE IN CDMX

The  CDMX  Resilience  Strategy  is  an 
opportunity to bring together a vision to 
build resilience and to guide government, 
the private sector, civil society, and the 
scientific community to respond to the 
main shocks and stresses that the city 
faces in a cross-functional, integrated, and 
multilevel approach (at the community, 
local, city, and regional levels).

The pillars and actions of the Resilience 
Strategy seek to contribute to the creation 
of a more equitable CDMX and to focus 
on the population that is most affected 
by the city’s many present or potential 
perils. Inequality manifests in various ways 
in the city (for example, in unequal access 
to services, urban amenities, housing, and 
employment). Likewise, vulnerability and 
adaptive  capacity  to  various  risks  are 
not the same for different parts of the 
population. For this reason, the Resilience 
Strategy acknowledges such differences 
and seeks to benefit vulnerable groups 
through the proposed goals and actions.

Resilience is built through an all-embracing 
process  that  considers  the  views  of 
stakeholders from the various levels of 
government and members of the scientific 

community, civil society, corporations, 
representatives  of  the  private  sector, 
and multilateral and bilateral cooperative 
organizations. It is important to foster 
cooperation among these stakeholders 
through  coalitions  of  organizations 
with shared goals and actions to build 
resilience.

The Resilience Strategy drives an adaptive 
transformation  by  fostering  a  change 
of paradigm so that the development 
process transcends traditional frameworks 
to face complex problems and to design, 
modify, and implement public policies by 
cross-functional planning. To achieve this 
end, continuous learning and frequent 
review of plans and actions are required. 
The commitment to this type of learning 
and  review  is  an  acknowledgment  of 
the  seriousness  of  the  city’s  social-
environmental  challenges  and  the 
opportunities the city has to make real 
progress  on  sustainable  social  and 
economic activities that can transform 
its future.

CHAPTER V.  RESILIENCE STRATEGY100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYV. RESILIENCE STRATEGY

ACTIONS

The  goal  of  the  Resilience  Strategy 
for  CDMX  is  to  identify  opportunities 
and  define  priorities  for  building  city 
resilience. The strategy’s vision must be 
broad and ambitious to respond to the 
city’s  existing  challenges.  To  address 
the main challenges outlined in Chapter 
II, Resilience Challenges in CDMX,  the 
Resilience  Strategy  incorporated  five 

pillars, each of which has distinct goals, 
actions, and activities. 

To define the goals and actions for each 
pillar, certain overarching concepts were 
established.

BUILDING RESILIENCE IN 
SPECIFIC AREAS AT THE 
COMMUNITY LEVEL

VULNERABLE 
GROUPS

The distribution of stresses and shocks 
in  some  communities  is  concentrated 
spatially. In the short and medium term, 
actions,  innovations,  and  resource 
alignment  are  needed  to  increase 
resilience at the community level if such 
actions are to be replicated in other areas 
of the city and region. There is a great 
diversity of programs and actions that 
may, with some modifications, increase 
resilience at the community level.

Shocks and stresses must be considered 
concurrently,  as  there  is  a  close 
relationship between them. This close 
relationship  is  evident  in  the  varying 
effects  that  result  from  the  different 
adaptive capacities of different groups 
in the population. For example, poverty, 
marginalization, and gender differences 
limit  the  adaptive  capacity  of  the 
population  to  face  disasters,  and  this 
limited adaptive capacity increases their 
vulnerability.  Therefore,  actions  must 
identify  vulnerable  groups  and  build 
resilience at the community level.

EDUCATION AND 
COMMUNICATION

REGIONAL 
PERSPECTIVE

The preparation of educational messages 
and  the  design  of  communication 
campaigns around resilience are designed 
as elements to increase understanding by 
key stakeholders and society and to foster 
citizen involvement in resilience building.

To build a culture of resilience at both the 
metropolitan and the megalopolitan level, 
input from a regional perspective must be 
sought and included.

Three types of actions are included in this Resilience Strategy:

1. Actions and activities that are conducted by organizations or institutions of 
government, the private sector, civil society, or the scientific community that 
are identified by their value to building resilience in the city.

2. Actions and activities that are noted for their relevance  because they bring 
cross-resilience principles or have a significant positive impact on city and regional 
development.

3. Actions and activities that have a resilience value. These actions are divided 
into two types:

 
 

 
 
 

Actions and activities in the planning process that require support to
implement. 

Actions and activities that have not yet been implemented, but that are
suggested for the future because they represent an opportunity to 
build resilience.

The period in which an action is to take place is described as follows:

1. Short term (2016-2018): Actions already under way or about to start, but that 
will be concluded during the current administration.
2. Medium term (2016-2025): Actions that will need to be continued into the 
future to be effective despite political-administrative changes.
3.  Long  term  (2016-2040):  Actions  that  will  require  longer  planning  and 
implementation processes that are responding to a vision of resilience related to 
transformation toward the sustainability of the city and the region.

Three types of stakeholders are involved in actions and activities:

Responsible parties:  Government entities in charge of developing an action that 
have the task of reporting progress within the monitoring, reporting, and verifying 
(MRV) mechanism.
Participants: Other government entities involved in developing an action or a 
specific activity.
Partners: Members of private-sector, civil society, academic, or international 
organizations that contribute to the development of actions or activities.

The  Resilience  Strategy  is  an  ever-
changing document that requires ongoing 
assessment  and  that  incorporates  a 
learning process that allows for responses 
to a dynamic context. Due to the scope 
of a Resilience Strategy, this document 
could not include all the issues that might 
be relevant to building resilience. 

Therefore,  regular  reviews  must  be 
conducted  to  ensure  that  goals  and 
actions are evaluated and updated. An 
MRV  system  will  be  implemented  to 
support regular evaluations, continuous 
learning,  and  reflection  on  building 
resilience, specifically for communities 
and vulnerable groups.

ESTRATEGIA DE RESILIENCIAPILLAR 01. FOSTER REGIONAL COORDINATION100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPROBLEM DESCRIPTION

The megalopolitan area at center of the 
country includes Mexico City, the States 
of Mexico, Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Morelos, and 
Puebla (Figure 21). Historically, this area 
has been the dominant area in the country 
in economic, social, and political terms. 
This metropolitan area consists of the 16 
boroughs that constitute Mexico City and 
224 municipalities in other states.[58]

CDMX maintains a dynamic relationship 
between the city and its megalopolitan 
region in terms of the movement of the 
population  and  movement  within  the 
transportation system. For example, 40 
percent of metropolitan area inhabitants 
have  to  cross  at  least  one  municipal 
border to get to their workplace.[59] The 
corridor Mexico–Puebla registers about 
760,000 people traveling daily, and 24 
percent of the goods bought and sold 
in the city come from other parts of the 
region.[60] 

This close relationship between CDMX and 
its surrounding metropolitan area means 
that many challenges must be addressed 
jointly to keep the city functioning.

Strategic issues such as water resources 
management, mobility, territorial planning, 
conservation  of  natural  resources, 
and  biodiversity  share  a  regional 
view.  For  example,  the  water  used  in 
CDMX metropolitan areas, Toluca, and 
Cuernavaca depends greatly on the Water 
Forest, an aquifer recharge area that is 
shared by three states.[61]

Given that the rivers, aquifers, air, and 
commuters  in  ZMVM  extend  beyond 
political  borders,  the  management  of 
resources  has  to  be  organized  at  the 
metropolitan and megalopolitan levels,[62] 
as such management would be limited in 
scope without a regional approach.

In  addition,  the  large  number  of 
administrative stakeholders makes the 
design  and  implementation  of  public 
policies and regional planning difficult. 
As a result, the governance structure in 
the region is fragmented.[63] The CDMX 
Resilience Strategy must be implemented 
at multiple levels, from local to regional.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPILLAR 01. FOSTER REGIONAL COORDINATIONGOAL 1.1.
Create resilience through 
institutional coordination and 
regional strategic communication.

ACTION 1.1.1. 
Foster resilience integration in regional programs.

Integrating  resilience  into  regional 
programs  allows  for  priority  issues  to 
be addressed in a way that strengthens 
projects  and  policies  related  to 
management  and  reduction  of  risks 
and  social  vulnerability  in  a  cross-
cutting  manner  that  brings  together 
multiple sectors. Examples of this type 
of  integration  are  the  reactivation  of 
the  COMETRAVI  and  integration  of  a 
potential guiding principle of resilience 
in the upcoming POZMVM.

Responsible Parties: OR
Partners: AECOM, Iniciativa ARISE
Period: 2016 – 2025

Resilience Value:
By considering resilience principles from a 
regional view, this action would strengthen 
state  capacities  for  risk  prevention, 
attention  to  vulnerable  groups,  and 
reduction of inequality in access to basic 
services. Realization of these values would 
increase integration and social inclusion.

ACTION 1.1.2. 
Drive and support the creation of a national resilience 
agenda with Mexican cities belonging to 100RC Network.

Currently,  four  Mexican  cities  belong 
to  the  100RC  network:  CDMX  (2013), 
Ciudad  Juarez  (2014),  Colima  (2016), 
and  the  Guadalajara  Metropolitan 
Area (2016). These four cities have an 
opportunity to share their experiences 
and best practices and to foster a national 
resilience agenda that could serve as a 
guide for the implementation of actions 
in other cities that are not members of the 
100RC network. This sharing of resilience 
experiences  and  best  practices  could 
boost  domestic  capacity  to  prevent, 
identify, mitigate, adapt to, and manage 
climate shocks and stresses and in the 
process build national resilience.

Responsible Parties: OR, 
Partners:  100RC, Embajada de Holanda 
Period: 2016 - 2025

Resilience Value:
The creation of a national resilience agenda 
would allow for consideration of resilience 
principles in sectoral plans. This approach 
would favor comprehensive planning in the 
long term. The implementation of projects 
and  actions  based  on  comprehensive 
planning would improve the quality of 
life in Mexican cities and provide cities 
with capacity to anticipate and respond 
to various shocks and stresses.

INSPIRATION:  THE NATURAL DISASTER RESILIENCE COMPETITION (NDRC) 
- UNITED STATES.

In June 2015, 40 states and cities in the United States that had suffered from 
a natural disaster between 2011 and 2013 were invited to compete for $USD 
1 billion to finance disaster recovery and foster long-term community resilience. 
Among the winners were the states of California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and 
Virginia and the cities of New Orleans, Springfield, MA, and New York.

The process conducted for this competition was unique in that:

•  A competition method was used to allocate federal funds.
•  Multidisciplinary groups of subject-matter experts were organized to work 

directly with teams to develop their proposals.

•  Proposed projects had to involve various organizations and prove that 

diverse financing sources were used to prepare the project.

•  Philanthropic partners were included to provide resources to build capacity. 

These partners worked individually with the teams.

•  Leadership  was  available  at  the  federal  level,  as  demonstrated  by  a 
commitment to change the manner that budgets for disasters are prepared.

Because four Mexican cities are currently part of the 100RC Network, this 
initiative offers an example of how collaboration can be fostered on a national 
scale to build resilience.

INSPIRATION FROM MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA: METROPOLITAN FOREST. 

The Melbourne Resilience Strategy fosters the creation of a metropolitan forest 
using conservation and reforestation projects that involve all municipalities in 
the region under a common framework. The strategy seeks to capitalize on the 
benefits realized by keeping green areas at a metropolitan scale.

ACTION 1.2.1 
Strengthen projects that foster conservation of ecosystems.

This action would protect natural areas 
and Conservation Areas by developing 
restoration, recovery, and maintenance 
projects  to  preserve  the  stability  of 
ecosystems  and  provide  ecosystem 
services in natural areas.

Responsible Parties:  Federal District 
Inter-Institutional Climate Change 
Commission, Conservation 
International
Partners:  LANCIS-UNAM
Period: 2016 - 2040

Resilience Value:
Conservation of ecosystems reduces their 
vulnerability and physical exposure to 
extreme weather events and contributes 
to their basic needs by protecting and 
restoring critical environmental assets. 

ACTIVITY  1.2.1.1.  Implement  Water 
Forest Initiative.

This initiative seeks to develop and 
implement a regional conservation 
strategy for a Water Forest that would 
provide water and ecosystem services 
to Mexico City, the State of Mexico, 
and Morelos. Specifically, this initiative 
seeks to identify common objectives 
that  encourage  participation, 
integration,  and  coordination  and 
strengthen  water  resilience  for 
metropolitan  and  megalopolitan 
regions.

Participants: SEDEMA, SEMARNAT
Partners:  Fundación  Gonzalo  Río 
Arronte, LANCIS-UNAM 
Period: 2016 - 2040

ACTION 1.2.2. 
Reduce pollution in the region (air, water, solid waste, and 
chemical waste, among others).

Measures  to  counter  air  pollution  will 
be continued through initiatives such as 
Program to Improve the Valley of Mexico 
Metropolitan Zone Air Quality (PROAIRE) 
2011–2020.  Other  regional  programs 
that will be championed will help reduce 
pollutants in water and soil and conduct 
appropriate waste management activities.

Responsible  Parties:  Autoridades 
ambientales estatales 
Partners: LANCIS- UNAM 
Period: 2016 – 2040

Resilience Value:
By reducing pollution at the regional level, 
the quality of life, the health of inhabitants 
in  the  megalopolis,  and  ecosystems 
are  improved;  opportunities  for  clean 
development are also created.

Foster resilient infrastructure projects that contribute to the 
development of the region.

As  part  of  this  action,  measures  that 
increase  resilience  with  regard  to 
regional infrastructure projects will be 
implemented. An example of this type of 
resilient infrastructure project is the New 
International Airport of Mexico City and 
the adaptive use of the current Mexico 
City International Airport (see Figure 22).

Resilience Value:
The development of this action would 
encourage the implementation of large 
infrastructure  projects  that  generate 
multiple design benefits, drive sustainable 
transformation in the region, and foster 
social and economic development.

Responsible Parties:  OR
Partners:  100RC 
Period:  2016 - 2018

FEATURED ACTIVITY  1.2.3.1. Contribute to resilience by creating 
a resilience agenda for the New International Airport 
of Mexico City and the fate of the current Mexico City 
International Airport.

Airports play an important role in the development of cities. Due to their size, location, 
and social characteristic, NAICM and the future of the current AICM represent a great 
opportunity to catalyze urban and economic transformation in CDMX, ZMVM, and 
the megalopolis.

A project with resilient features would foster greater social cohesion and create 
opportunities to leverage the potential of the eastern end of city through mobility 
improvement,[64] urban parks, housing developments, new amenities, public spaces, 
and the development of educational facilities.

Such a project would offer opportunities to achieve several resilience benefits by:

•  Building resilience and an adaptation process in the face of extreme events resulting 

from climate change, especially with regard to security and water resilience.

•  Encouraging environmental renewal by building a large park to achieve multiple 
benefits and environmental services, all of which would lead to a more sustainable 
and equitable city.
Innovating to develop urban amenities with environmental and mobility benefits.

• 

The 761.1 hectares on which the current Mexico City International Airport is situated 
represent an opportunity for Mexico City to reconfigure its urban infrastructure, 
develop a strategic view, and foster more resilient development.

In addition, the NAICM project may serve to encourage improved coordination of 
specific initiatives at ZMVM by designing a master plan with a megalopolitan view. 
This moment in time is unique; it is an opportunity to innovate using a participatory, 
comprehensive, and transparent process that leads to and fosters a resilient, sustainable 
future for the city.

In April 2016, a Resilience Garage (a participatory planning and design workshop) was 
conducted, with support from 100RC, on the NAICM project. By bringing together 
an interdisciplinary group of subject-matter experts this workshop sought ways to 
integrate resilience principles into city planning and large infrastructure projects. 
Specific proposals were developed for the NAICM project to increase its resilience 
and the resilience of the entire region.

Participants: Grupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de México, SEDATU, SEDECO, SEDUVI. 
Period 2016-2025.

PROMOTE WATER
RESILIENCE AS A 
NEW PARADIGM TO 
MANAGE WATER IN 
THE MEXICO BASIN

VISION: To respond to the risks and shocks associated with 
climate change and social and environmental pressures, and to 
ensure equity in water access and water security,[65] for all who 
live and work in CDMX, the city manages water resources in 
the Mexico Basin based on the principles of the Comprehensive 
Management of City Water Resources (GIRHU)[66] process. 

65. Water security refers to the ability of a society to safeguard access to water, in the quantity needed and the quality required, 

to enable social welfare, lifestyle and socioeconomic development; to ensure protection against water pollution and water 

disasters; and to preserve ecosystems in an atmosphere of social peace and political stability (UN-Water, 2013).

66. GIRHU is a flexible, participatory and iterative process that integrates all elements of the urban water cycle (water supply, 

sanitation, stormwater management, and waste management) with the city’s urban development and watershed management—

and its natural resources and ecosystem services—to maximize the economic, social, and environmental benefits in an equitable 

and inclusive manner. It involves the participation of different stakeholders in developing the short- and long-term actions, 

synergies, and investments required in traditional infrastructure, green infrastructure, institutional development, financing, and 

capacity building, among others (World Bank, 2012).

76

GOAL 2.1 
Reduce water scarcity and access 
inequality.

GOAL 2.2 
Promote sustainable use of the 
aquifer and contribute to water 
security planning.

GOAL 2.3 
Foster a civic culture on the 
sustainability of water resources.

GOAL 2.4
Integrate a water-sensitive 
approach to urban design through

ESTRATEGIA DE RESILIENCIA100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPILLAR 02. PROMOTE WATER RESILIENCEPROBLEM STATEMENT

Despite significant efforts by government 
departments and agencies at both the 
local and federal levels, water security 
of CDMX and ZMVM is at risk due to the 
severe degradation of water resources, 
including the groundwater, in the Mexico 
Basin. Currently, the drinking water supply 
for all the city’s inhabitants and for the 
development of socioeconomic activities 
is at risk because, over time, complex and 
interdependent factors have created a 
crisis.

Among the factors that have contributed 
to increasing water demand in the ZMVM 
are the following: loss of 41.4 percent of 
water in leaks from the drinking water 
distribution system;[67] population growth 
in the city and the expansion of urban 
sprawl; [68] population growth in the city 
and the expansion of urban sprawl,   and 
the lack of awareness of the impacts of 
excessive consumption by some sectors 
of the population. [69] 

While the average water capacity per 
capita in the country is 140,623 ft3/person/
year, it is only 5,367 ft3/person/year in 
CDMX. The disparity in per capita capacity 
is an indicator of the great stress that the 
city’s water system is experiencing.[70]

Disparities by area exist because water 
scarcity is reflected in service rotation 
and poor water quality, particularly in low-
income areas in the eastern portion of the 
city (Tláhuac and Iztapalapa) and elevated 
areas on the hillsides and surrounding 
mountains. [71]

The city has met the ever-growing need 
for water through overexploitation of the 
city’s shallow aquifer. The overexploitation 
has  upset  the  water  balance,  as  the 
extraction from the aquifer has exceeded 
the  aquifer’s  ability  to  recharge  by 
infiltration,  and  this  has  caused  a 
significant differential subsidence in CDMX 
and ZMVM. 

Such  subsidence  can  vary  from  4  to          
36  cm/year[72]  in  different  areas.  It  is 
estimated that the center of CDMX has 
experienced up to 10 meters of subsidence 
over the past 6 decades,[73] subsidence 
which has damaged infrastructure and 
buildings  and  resulted  in  high  repair    
costs.[74]

Differential subsidence and inadequate 
solid waste management have caused 
drainage infrastructure to lose the ability 
to  evacuate  rainwater.[75]  To  address 
these  problems,  complex  and  costly 
infrastructure projects such as the East 

67. SACMEX, 2014. 

68. Urban sprawl has increased the area of CDMX 5.4 times between 1950 and 2000, and population has increased by 5.6 times 

between 1950 and 2005 (World Bank, 2013). 

69.The average consumption per capita in CDMX is 320 liters per day, but per capita consumption varies according to the 

distribution each city borough receives: Tlalpan receives 500 liters, Magdalena Contreras receives 200 liters, and other areas 

receive less than 20 liters per day (SEDEMA, 2013a).

70. SACMEX, 2016.

71. Water is delivered daily to 82% of the population; to 10%, every third day; to 5%, twice a week; to 1%, once a week; and to 

78

2%, occasionally (SACMEX, 2014).

72. SACMEX, 2013.

73. SACMEX, 2012a.

74. SACMEX, 2012b.

75. CONAGUA, 2012b.

Similarly,  the  use  of  large  volumes  of 
water, and the inability to recycle and 
reuse  that  water,  generates  a  large 
volume  wastewater,  most  of  which 
does not receive adequate treatment. 
Consequently, wastewater strongly affects 
environmental quality at the discharge 
zones.[76] The Atotonilco treatment plant 
is being built to address this problem.

In general, the challenge of water security 
in CDMX, both in terms of supply as well as 
drainage and treatment, has required large 
infrastructure projects and major political, 
institutional,  financial,  and  technical 
efforts. To address the challenge, CDMX 

has developed a set of guidelines and 
strategies for different integrated projects, 
such as the Program of Integrated Water 
Resources (2012) and the Water Plan for 
the Future of CDMX (2014).

Given the complexity of the situation, 
efforts must continue to develop a GIRHU 
strategy that achieves water security for 
CDMX through a stable and systematic 
process. To achieve this, the Resilience 
Strategy aims to identify a set of goals 
that promote actions that will build the 
resilience necessary to achieve each goal, 
despite  significant  risks  and  unknown 
obstacles.

GOAL 2.1.
Reduce water scarcity and access 
inequality.

ACTION 2.1.1. 
Integrate the majority of the population without regular and 
continuous water service to the water supply system.

Through the expansion of the primary 
drinking water network, the supply to peri-
urban communities and difficult-to-reach 
areas will be increased.

Responsible Parties: SACMEX
Partners: BM, BID 
Period: 2016 – 2025

Resilience Value:
Through  this  action,  the  unequal 
distribution of water resources is reduced.

ACTION 2.1.2. 
Promote public, economic, regulatory, and political instruments 
to reduce water scarcity and inequality.

Adjust  fees  to  the  amount  of  water 
consumed  in  households,  so  that  the 
costs  of  operation,  maintenance,  and 
rehabilitation  of  infrastructure  are 
covered, the quality of service improves, 
and user awareness of excessive water 
use increases. Fees will reflect the cost 
of service, which will be accessible to all.

Resilience Value:
This  action  helps  raise  awareness 
of  the  true  value  of  water  and  helps 
regulate its daily consumption. It also 
ensures  maintenance  of  critical  water 
infrastructure and reduces pressure on 
the scarce resource.

Promote the establishment of temporary rainwater catchment 
systems and water “kiosks” in areas and houses with a scarcity 
of water.

The installation of rainwater catchment 
systems temporarily supplies water to 
households that do not yet have access 
to the water network.

Responsible Parties: SEDESO
Partners: Isla Urbana, CEMEX, CAF
Period:  2016 - 2018

Resilience Value:
This action guarantees access to basic 
water  service  in  underserved  areas 
through a flexible system and helps to 
ensure continuous service in areas with 
limited access.

ACTIVITY  2.1.3.1.  Install  rainwater 
catchment systems in houses with 
water scarcity.

In offering the Rainwater Catchment 
Systems  program  to  community 
kitchens and households with limited 
access to water, the government of 
CDMX is helping build water resilience 
by reducing pressure on the aquifer 
and addressing the water needs of 
vulnerable households with a lack of 
access to water. In the first phase, 300

PILLAR 02. PROMOTE WATER RESILIENCE100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYFEATURED ACTIVITY  2.2.1.1. Implementation of the Water Fund

The development of the Water Fund for CDMX began in early 2015 and is expected 
to be completed during 2017. The conservation plan, definition of the basis for the 
monitoring protocol, creation of legal and financial entities, and kick-off of pilot 
projects in aquifer recharge areas will be outlined in 2016. These activities are vitally 
important for building resilience and water security in the Mexico Basin.

TNC, on behalf of the Latin American Water Funds Partnership and in partnership 
with other organizations, is preparing a Water Fund for CDMX. Water funds are 
innovative conservation mechanisms to protect ecosystem features, with the aim of 
strengthening the water security of urban areas. Water funds attract funding in an 
organized and transparent manner from large water users and other donors, such 
as drinking water and sanitation operators, irrigation districts, hydroelectric plants, 
and foundations. Funds are used to support conservation actions in strategic land 
extensions for regulating the water cycle and enhancing regional ecosystem integrity.

Funds achieve economic sustainability through investment in financial markets, while 
returns on investment are invested and leveraged with other funding sources to 
protect extensions and land easements for conservation, develop technical support, 
and promote sustainable forms of life and community development in the regions 
of influence.

The Water Fund for CDMX aims to help reduce the imbalance of the aquifer and 
promote a positive long-term water balance. Conservation of aquifer recharge areas 
will contribute to making the city’s water supply system more robust and redundant. 
At the same time, these actions will have a number of benefits, including lower 
subsidence, mitigation and adaptation to climate change (for example, in a scenario 
of regional drought), and protection of biologically significant sites.

ACTION 2.2.2. 
Innovate in the maintenance and renovation of the water 
network and drainage system as well as in water reuse and 
treatment.

Aging  water  infrastructure  of  CDMX 
calls for a structural maintenance and 
modernization program for the drinking 
water  distribution  network  to  ensure 
efficient and quality service to the entire 
population.

Responsible Parties: SACMEX
Partners: WB
Period: 2016 - 2025

Resilience Value: 
Modernizing the management of the water 
distribution network will make it more 
robust and redundant, and will help CDMX 
advance water security for its inhabitants.

ACTIVITY    2.2.2.1.  Upgrade  the 
drinking water distribution network 
associated with the loan granted by 
the World Bank to CDMX. 

Currently, details of a credit transaction 
by the World Bank to SACMEX are 
being  finalized,  which  include  the 
modernization of the management 
of drinking water in CDMX, including 
water treatment in all boroughs, water 
leak prevention and oversight, and 
division of the network into sectors 
for better measurement and control 
of infrastructure issues.

Some  of  the  actions  covered  are: 
furnish 1,174 SACMEX facilities with 
telemetry systems and remote control; 
optimize the service from 320 wells, 
16 springs, 16 bulk water deliveries, 26 
pumping plants, 26 tanks, 90 transfer 
stations,  52  pressure  stations,  13 
conducting lines, 78 rain gauges, and 
17 dams; and build 22 water treatment 
plants and rehabilitate 7 treatment 
plants.

These  actions  will  help  improve 
the efficiency of the drinking water 
distribution network. As part of this 
activity,  unaccounted  water  loss 
is  expected  to  be  reduced  from                  
42 percent to about 20 percent.

ACTION 2.2.5. 
Prevent damages to the water infrastructure in the event of 
a major earthquake.

The World Bank implements the Decision 
Tree  tool  to  support  decision  making 
under risk and uncertainty constraints. 
Using  the  tool,  different  agencies  can 
improve  the  water  resource  planning 
process, prioritize capital investments, 
and improve project design. For example, 
this type of tool can more accurately track 
the progress of adaptive transformation 
in preparing for a drought by identifying 
optimal  investments  and  necessary 
institutional changes.

Responsible Parties: SACMEX
Partners: WB
Period: 2016 - 2018

Resilience Value:
It contributes to the institutionalization 
of a thoughtful decision-making process 
to develop quantitative and qualitative 
scenarios; it is flexible because it generates 
different types of alternatives; innovative, 
as it offers options that may not have been 
contemplated  before;  and  integrated, 
as it coordinates and prioritizes actions 
between different actors. 

ACTION 2.2.4. 
Improve the quality and quantity of water in the area of aquifer 
recharge.

Through  conservation  efforts  and 
improvements in water management, such 
as forest maintenance, reforestation, and 
retention in recharge areas, the quality 
and quantity of the water supplied to 
CDMX and ZMVM will be improved.

Responsible Parties: Conservation 
International
Partners: TNC
Period: 2016 - 2025

Resilience Value:
This  action  fosters  the  recovery  of 
watersheds that supply water to the city, 
which enhances ecosystem benefits and 
increases the water security of the Mexico 
Basin.

The vulnerability of water infrastructure in 
the event of a large-magnitude earthquake 
has been identified. Because the scale of 
damage that could occur is unknown, the 
most vulnerable areas must be identified, 
the  drinking  water  network  must  be 
continuously monitored and maintained, 
and the resources to properly respond if 
an earthquake occurs must be available.

Responsible Parties: SACMEX
Period: 2016 - 2025

Resilience Value:
Identifying  vulnerabilities  in  CDMX’s 
hydraulic infrastructure in the event of 
an earthquake is a key element of a risk 
management plan, which also includes 
a  preventive  maintenance  investment 
program. Both elements are critical to 
making  the  system  more  robust  and 
redundant.

ACTIVITY  2.2.5.1.  Identify  areas  of 
the city where water infrastructure 
is vulnerable to the effects of a major 
earthquake.

As  was  demonstrated  by  the  1985 
earthquake,  a  major  earthquake 
can  have  severe  effects  on  water 
infrastructure,  particularly  on 
infrastructure components that have 
not  been  maintained.  Therefore, 
the  National  Water  Commission 
(CONAGUA),  along  with  SACMEX 
and the Mexican Institute of Water 
Technology  (IMTA)  will  develop  a 
comprehensive  assessment  of  the 
risk of earthquakes to the strategic 
infrastructure  of  CDMX’s  drinking 
water network.

Participants: IMTA, CONAGUA
Period: 2016 - 2025

ACTION 2.2.6. 
Identify the opportunities and shocks of mega-infrastructure 
projects on water security.

The impacts of megaprojects in the region 
will  be  assessed,  including  the  urban 
development in regional areas, which is 
not only increasing the demand for water 
but also increasing wastewater generation 
in the area. The impacts of megaprojects 
must be considered in the development 
of the GIRHU strategy for the region.

Resilience Value:
Understanding the increasing impacts of 
water demand and wastewater generation 
in areas affected by megaprojects and 
capitalizing  on  opportunities  to  build 
water resilience will help produce a more 
robust, redundant, and socially inclusive 
water resource management system.

ACTION 2.4.1. 
Promote the restoration of bodies of water and watersheds.

The considerable subsidization of water 
consumption in some areas of the city 
and the lack of user awareness about 
the vulnerability of water resources are 
factors that contribute to excessive water

Period: 2016 - 2040 

Resilience Value:
This  action  promotes  community 
participation and helps citizens become 
more aware of the value of water resources, 
which can result in reduced waste and 
more appropriate and responsible water 
consumption in the future.

Regenerating and restoring natural water 
bodies  and  watersheds  can  prevent 
flooding and encourage adaptation to 
droughts caused by climate change.

Responsible Parties: SEDEMA

Period: 2016 - 2025

Resilience Value:
Environmental cleanup of watersheds 
and  rivers  and  the  production  and 
management of green infrastructure have 
a number of environmental, economic, 
and  social  benefits  that  contribute  to 
meeting the basic needs of the population, 
to  enriching  natural  assets,  and  to 
strengthening adaptive capacities in the 
event of a decrease in the water supply.

ACTIVITY  2.4.1.1.  Implement  the 
comprehensive rescue program of 
the Magdalena and Eslava Rivers.

This program will clean up part of the 
Magdalena and Eslava river basins, 
increase their flows and runoffs, and 
conserve  and  manage  the  nearby 
forest,  thereby  contributing  to  the 
area’s green infrastructure. Through 
a participatory approach, this program 
will also help increase environmental

NEW ORLEANS INSPIRATION.

Through green infrastructure projects, the city of New Orleans is demonstrating 
how  unused space can be used to store rainwater and is transforming vacant 
lots into gardens that capture rainwater and remove contaminants. These 
projects offer other benefits, as they result in more attractive neighborhoods 
wherever they are developed.

ACTION 2.4.2. 
Develop  rainwater  catchment,  retention,  regulation  and 
infiltration, and flood prevention alternatives.

Projects using various green and blue 
infrastructure  methodologies  and 
technologies can capture rainwater and 
retain it for later use, and infiltrate it into 
aquifers. Such projects also seek to build 
inclusive public spaces and at the same 
time promote education and awareness 
about water conservation in cities.

Resilience Value:
This action helps reduce the negative 
impacts  of  floods,  especially  in  rainy 
seasons. Additionally, by creating more 
green spaces for recreation and public 
enjoyment, this action has social benefits 
that improve social cohesion.

ACTIVITY  2.4.2.1.  Create  strategic 
infrastructure for rainwater catchment 
and retention and flood mitigation, 
including: water conservation areas, 
green spaces, and multifunctional 
parking lots.

AEP  is  developing  the  green-blue 
infrastructure  project  “Parque 
de  la  Viga  (La  Viga  Park),”  which 
aims to design this public space as 
infrastructure to store and reuse water. 
The design allows rainwater catchment 
and  storage,  which  will  prevent 
flooding in other areas, encourage the 
absorption of rainwater into the soil, 
and help maintain the water balance 
in the area.

to urban expansion into peripheral areas 
of the ZMVM. This growth pattern has 
created major challenges for mobility, 
as much of the population must travel 
long distances to access employment 
opportunities and other services.

In CDMX, most urban growth occurs in 
Conservation Areas, which puts pressure 
on the environmental services that these 
lands provide. In this context, SEDUVI is 
collaborating with SEDEMA to integrate 
protection  policies  for  Conservation 
Areas into the new CDMX General Urban 
Development Program with the objective 
to align them with ecological planning 
principles.

Urban  renewal  projects—together 
with recovery, expansion, and creation 
of  public  space,  green  areas,  urban 
amenities, and housing—can contribute 
to reducing risks, increasing socio-spatial 
equality, and achieving proper resource 
management, especially for water. Urban 
and regional planning, design, and policies 
should consider the possible impacts of 
climate change and take into account 
the vulnerabilities associated with the 
conditions  of  underdevelopment  and 
social marginalization of certain groups 
and communities in the city.

The impacts associated with urban growth 
in recent decades have created major 
challenges for land use and urban planning 
in CDMX and ZMVM. Urban resilience is 
designed to promote an equitable, safe, 
and connected city through the design 
of programs, projects, and urban policies 
that use a comprehensive approach l[77],to 
promote a better quality of life despite 
the size and complexity of the territory.

The concentration of companies and work 
in the central city areas generates social 
inequality and hinders access to basic 
services for part of the population (Figure 
24).[78] Socioeconomic inequality is most 
evident in the areas north and east of the 
ZMVM, which have the highest number 
of  people  in  poverty.[79]  In  contrast, 
the central city has a higher number of 
services and jobs and a lower percentage 
of people in poverty.[80]

CDMX has a shortage of green areas (e.g., 
urban forests, parks), which are important 
for the city and its inhabitants. Although 
international standards propose 96.8 to 
172 square feet (sq ft) of green space per 
inhabitant, in CDMX there are 58.1 sq ft 
per inhabitant.[81] Likewise, in marginalized 
areas access to public space and urban 
amenities  is  insufficient.  The  World 
Health Organization (WHO) recommends 
107.6 to 161.4 sq ft of public space per 
inhabitant; but CDMX has only 55.9 sq ft 
per inhabitant.[82]

In CDMX, housing and employment are 
not balanced; this lack of balance has 
resulted in urban sprawl, which has led

employment, culture, security, public services, and social cohesion.

An opportunity for urban innovation 
is  to  implement  multifunctional 
projects that focus on water resources 
management. These projects would 
incorporate  water  catchment, 
storage,  and  reuse  systems.  Some 
ongoing  projects  are  Xochimilco 
Ecological Park, Laguna de Tláhuac 
Ecological Park, Quebradora Hydric 
Park  in  Iztapalapa,  and  Cuitlahuac

other benefits such as security and social 
cohesion.

Public space is a strategic public good 
that drives the transformation of a city 
and improves the quality of life of the

of public space in mitigating big city 
problems such as water scarcity and 
aquifer overexploitation. The project 
would  directly  benefit  the  30,000 
people who live within 0.31 mile (i.e., 
approximately 5 minutes walking) from 
the park, and the many others who visit 
the site. The project would affect an area 
of 177,496.88 sq ft. The project would 
increase green areas in the vicinity by up 
to 22 percent and increase public space 
in the zone by 26 percent.

PILLAR 03. PLAN FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL RESILIENCE100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYACTION  3.1.4. 
Improve access to affordable and public housing in areas with 
access to public transportation and sources of employment.

Urban sprawl has led to the construction 
of housing facilities that are increasingly 
distant  from  services,  employment 
opportunities, and public transportation. 
Optimization of social and public housing 
and  the  provision  of  new  financing 
schemes are measures to transform the 
city by reducing marginalization in urban 
environments. 

Current housing programs that have been 
flagged as priorities are the Multi-Family 
Housing Program (Programa de Vivienda 
en Conjunto), the Housing Improvement 
Program (Programa de Mejoramiento a la 
Vivienda), and the Emergent Affordable 
Housing Program (Programa de Vivienda 
Emergente de Interés Social). The goals of 
these programs will be to create a more 
accessible city, develop social and public 

housing that is connected to the existing 
transportation network (the STC Metro 
and Metrobús corridors and around the 
CETRAMs), and propose a common long-
term agenda to promote such housing.

Partners: BID, BM
Period: 2016-2040

Resilience Value:
Housing  that  is  connected  to  the 
transportation network and the locations 
of employment contributes to economic 
and social development and improves 
accessibility  to  urban  services  and 
infrastructure as well as general mobility 
within the city.

ACTION 3.1.3. 
Expand urban amenities to integrate resilience elements.

public space elements, green areas, and 
urban amenities.

Responsible Parties: SEDUVI 
Period: 2016-2025 

Resilience Value:
Through  the  design  and  construction 
of  resilient  and  multifunctional  urban 
amenities, CDMX can increase access to 
basic services; promote social cohesion; 
and  increase  the  quality  of  health, 
education, sport, and cultural services.

A  consolidated  strategy  is  needed  to 
increase  access  to  high-quality  urban 
amenities for health, education, sports, and 
culture, because those spaces promote 
social integration, common identity, and 
community well-being.

To  implement  a  strategy  for  better 
urban  infrastructure  distribution  and 
access, CDMX has carried out a number 
of projects, including the Neighborhood 
Improvement  Program  (Programa  de 
Mejoramiento  Barrial)  and  the  Public 
Markets Improvement Program (Programa 
de Mejoramiento de Mercados Públicos). 
CDMX has also established the Central-
East Strategic Management Area (Área 
de Gestión Estratégica Centro Oriente) 
as an action PPGDU project and a PGDU.

In  addition,  the  General  Urban 
Development  Program  (Programa 
General de Desarrollo Urbano) and District 
Programs (Programas Delegacionales) are 
an opportunity to establish guidelines for 
better distribution of and access to quality 
urban amenities in the city. Such guidelines 
allow for the creation of neighborhood

of the urban areas into Conservation Areas.

The Borde Activo (Active Edge) initiative 
is part of the PPGDU as an area where pilot 
projects for environmental restoration 
and  urban  area  containment  will  be 
implemented. The Borde Activo initiative, 
also called Critical Areas of Occupation of 
Conservation Areas, which was developed

that will limit urban growth and protect 
ecosystems  by  creating  a  productive 
link between socioeconomics and the 
environment.

Responsible Parties: SEDEMA
Partners: TNC
Period: 2016-2040

Resilience Value:
The Borde Activo initiative will help control 
urban growth through land conservation. 
The initiative will help stem progressive 
changes  in  land  use  and  landscape 
fragmentation and improve the natural 
assets available to the city. 

102

ACTIVITY3.2.1.1. Promote and develop the Borde Activo initiative.

Currently,  there  is  strong  pressure 
on  Conservation  Areas  due  to  the 
continued expansion of urban areas. 
This project promotes sustainable urban 
development by limiting urban growth 
and encouraging the preservation and 
renewal of ecosystems. One of the main 
components of the initiative refers to 
the  potential  for  aquifer  recharge 
and  the  recovery  of  areas  with  high 
environmental value. For the initiative, 
the  participation  of  multiple  actors 
that influence land management and 
project consolidation is essential. This 
participation will involve technical input

PILLAR 03. PLAN FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL RESILIENCE100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYGOAL 3.3.
Reduce risk through urban and 
regional planning.

ACTION 3.3.1.
Promote institutional synergy and incorporate the principles 
of resilience at various levels of planning.

Responsible Parties:  SEDUVI
Period: 2016-2018

Resilience Value:
Consideration of resilience principles in 
planning gives a comprehensive long-term 
vision and strengthens urban projects and 
policies related to risk reduction and long-
term vulnerability management.

Urban  policies  that  incorporate  the 
principles of resilience at different levels 
of planning should be created from the 
PPGDU and Partial and District Urban 
Development  Programs  (Programas 
Delegacionales y Parciales de Desarrollo 
Urbano) and, at federal level, links should 
be established with the POZMVM.

Efforts  at  the  institutional  level  to 
consolidate policies that focus on reducing 
various risks and stresses present in the 
city and the region must be approved 
and coordinated. One essential activity is 
the linking of information from the CDMX 
Atlas  of  Risks  and  Hazards  (Atlas  de 
Riesgos y Peligros) with different planning 
instruments to inform decision making at 
the city level.

ACTIVITY 3.3.1.1 Embed Resilience into the General Urban Development Program 
and in the POZMVM.

CDMX,  through  SEDUVI  and  in 
collaboration  with  SEDEMA,  will 
develop the new PGDU to incorporate 
a “cross-cutting pillar” of resilience. This 
pillar will promote safe environments 
that  generate  a  better  quality  of 
life  and  sustainable  management  of 
environmental resources. In addition, 
strategic issues will be identified, such 
as reducing social inequality by means 
of access to public space, green areas, 
urban amenities, and housing.

In  addition,  transportation-oriented 
urban development will be promoted 
that  prioritizes  the  mobility  of 
pedestrians and cyclists to integrate 

a  sustainable  vision  of  resource 
management,  such  as  responsible 
water management. A crucial issue is 
the inclusion of information from the 
Hazards Risk Atlas (Atlas de Riesgos y 
Peligros) to strengthen urban planning 
concerning the risks and stresses that 
the city faces.

ACTION 3.3.2.
Invest in areas and urban renewal projects that reduce risk and 
promote sustainable management of economic, environmental, 
and social resources.

This action will identify strategies that 
promote resilience through interventions 
at  the  urban  level.  SEDUVI  develops 
projects  for  urban  renewal  in  some 
areas of CDMX that are an opportunity 
to integrate resilience principles. These 
areas  are  classified  in  two  planning 
instruments called Cooperation-based 
Performance  Systems  (Sistemas  de 
Actuación por Cooperación [SAC])  [83]  
and Strategic Management Areas (i.e., 
AGE).[84] Both instruments will be used to 
achieve conformity of policies and specific 
projects  to  encourage  environmental 
renewal  and  promote  topics  such  as 
public space, urban amenities, sustainable 
mobility, green and blue infrastructure, 
and housing.

Urban renewal projects can reduce risk 
and encourage responsible management 
of environmental resources.

Period:  2016-2025

Resilience Value:
The  achievement  of  renewal  and 
revitalization  of  urban  areas  through 
a comprehensive view is a mechanism 
to reduce risk and generate replicable 
strategies  for  proper  management  of 
natural  resources.  These  revitalized 
areas  have  potential  for  innovation 
in  socioeconomic  and  environmental 
development  and  integration  of  the 
community in that process.

PILLAR 03. PLAN FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL RESILIENCE100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYFEATURED ACTIVITY 3.3.2.1. Recovery of the Xochimilco, Tlahuac, 
and Milpa Alta Heritage Area through the creation of the 
Water Resilience Strategy in the Xochimilco-Tlahuac-Milpa 
Alta and Resilience Integration in AGE Design Master Plan 
for the area. 

One of the main initiatives for the Resilience Strategy is the Tlahuac-Xochimilco-Milpa 
Alta Heritage Area recovery project.[85] This area of great cultural, historical, and 
environmental value is subject to strong urban pressures from informal settlements. 
As a result, environmental degradation affects both the protected natural area and 
the productive agricultural areas.

In 2012, the Xochimilco, Tlahuac, and Milpa Alta Heritage Area Authority was created 
to structure and coordinate the recovery project for the area. Despite efforts to agree 
on a strategy to rescue the area, it is still necessary to generate adequate planning 
tools to unify the various efforts to achieve comprehensive land use planning.

Currently, SEDUVI, SEDEMA, and AZP are collaborating to create a Master Plan for 
the Xochimilco, Tlahuac, and Milpa Alta AGE. This collaboration is an opportunity to 
build a comprehensive long-term vision between urban development and land use 
planning through an approach that focuses on water management.

The Heritage Area requires a vision that integrates resilience with water as the 
development backbone of the area, because both the quality and the quantity of water 
is vital to the landscape and productive activities. Because of the complexity of the 
project, it must be approached from multiple angles to incorporate the principles of 
resilience in the different project areas while allowing for the alignment of technical 
knowledge with financial and human resources from various local, national, and 
international institutions. The challenge is to build a new relationship with urban 
settlements in the area through innovative landscape and water resources management.

Agricultural productivity and other economic activities such as tourism should be 
revitalized, making community co-design and citizen participation fundamental. Thus, 
a process such as Rebuild by Design [86]  can be a valuable contribution. In addition, 
the consortium formed between UAM and Deltares group [87]  will develop a Water 
Resilience Plan for the Heritage Zone and will identify a portfolio of measures to 
protect and restore the Xochimilco water system, making it possible to address climate 
change and other socioeconomic and socioecological stresses. The Resilience Office 
will provide support in technical collaborations to integrate the resilience principles 
in the Master Plan for Xochimilco, Tlahuac and Milpa Alta.

ESTRATEGIA DE RESILIENCIAPILLAR 03. PLAN FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL RESILIENCE100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYACTION 3.3.3.
Implement adaptation, mitigation, and resilience actions for 
communities and housing facilities in high-risk and marginalized 
areas.

Housing  facilities  in  risk  areas  should 
be  identified  for  possible  relocation, 
and those for which actions should be 
promoted to address the main impacts 
and stresses should be prioritized. Existing 
programs should also be expanded and 
strengthened to assist communities in 
high-risk areas (for example, the Gullies 
Improvement  Program  [Programa  de 
Mejoramiento de Barrancas] and the Risk 
Areas Housing Improvement Program 
[Programa de Mejoramiento de Vivienda 
en Zonas de Riesgo]). Likewise, there are 
also pilot projects that incorporate the 
principles of resilience at the community 
level such as Safe Neighborhood (Barrio 
Seguro) and the Retrieving Life Spaces 
in  the  Santa  Fe  Gullies  (Recuperando 

espacios para la vida en las barrancas de 
Santa Fe).

Responsible Parties: SPC
Partners:  CEMEX, Fundación Carlos Slim, 
IDB, Habitat para la Humanidad, UNAM, 
COLMEX, La Cuadra A.C.
Period: 2016-2025

Resilience Value:
This action will reduce urban growth in 
high-risk areas and encourage measures 
that  improve  the  living  conditions  of 
people  in  marginalized  areas  through 
enhancement of their environment and 
promotion of social cohesion.

ACTIVITY 3.3.3.1. Develop projects that focus on developing resilient 
urban areas

Resilience-focused  building  has  the 
potential  to  empower  communities 
through  projects  that  promote  local 
well-being. This activity proposes to 
create the first resilient community in 
the city based on a pilot project that 
incorporates  design  proposals  and 
urban interventions. This activity would 
also  integrate  co-design  and  citizen 
participation mechanisms and tools.

The  Iztapalapa  District  has  been 
identified as a pilot area for risk reduction 
and  climate  change  adaptation  that 
reduces social inequality. This action 
can be achieved through the need for 
accessibility  to  public  space,  urban 
amenities, and transportation.

Specifically,  the  Cerro  del  Peñon  is 
considered to be a site with potential 
to incorporate sustainable and resilient 
urban design guidelines. Some of the 
risks identified in this area are floods, 
landslides, subsidence, earthquakes, and 
the stresses related to water scarcity, 
lack of public transportation and urban 
amenities, and social underdevelopment, 
among others. The project will be an 
opportunity to generate methodologies 
and measures that may be replicated in 
other communities in the city.

INSPIRATION FROM ROTTERDAM: CLIMATE RESILIENT DISTRICT.

The city of Rotterdam is implementing the project “Climate Resilient District, 
ZOHO” (ClimateProof ZOHO District), which integrates water management 
measures through public space improvements and interventions with physical 
structures affected by the environment. The project is part of the Rotterdam 
Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change and part of Rotterdam’s Resilience 
Strategy. The ZOHO area is a strategic site because it incorporates replicable 
urban conditions and the potential key impacts of climate change such as 
floods, torrential rains, droughts, and heat waves.

The Climate Resilient District incorporates spaces that include adaptation and 
resilience measures in their design, such as the Water Plaza for water storage, 
restoration of water balance, and reduction of the effects of heat waves. The 
project includes the participation of key stakeholders, funding sources, and 
shared responsibilities for the maintenance of the spaces.

ESTRATEGIA DE RESILIENCIA100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPILLAR 04. IMPROVE MOBILITYThere are no sidewalks on 21.3 percent of 
city roads, and 89 percent of the roads are 
not accessible for people with disabilities. 
Road safety is considered a priority for the 
integration of CDMX with the Vision Zero 
Strategy for CDMX,[93] which is already 
in place.

Urban settings and their relationship to 
the location of jobs, services, and housing 
are other key issues for mobility.

Efforts at a metropolitan level to generate 
a  more  compact  and  connected  city 
need to be coordinated between those 
responsible for urban development and 
the mobility system.

Finally, data availability and access to 
information are two of the barriers for 
developing  integrated  and  innovative 
solutions for the city’s mobility challenges. 
It is essential to integrate platforms and 
tools that can facilitate the use of data for 
decision making.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Mobility is considered one of the main 
issues  at  a  local  and  metropolitan 
level  because  of  the  impact  it  has  on 
competitiveness, productivity, and the 
environment. In recent decades, major 
public investments were allocated for large 
infrastructure projects that encouraged 
the use of private transportation. Although 
only 30 percent of commutes are made by 
private car, 85 percent of the road space 
is used by this means of transportation. 
As a result, CDMX is one of the cities in 
the world with the highest number of 
traffic jams, which have a major impact 
on quality of life and public health.

Traffic  jams  add  to  commute  time 
and,  therefore  the  city´s  productivity 
and competitiveness are affected; it is 
estimated that traffic generated losses 
of  up  to  33  billion  pesos  per  year.[88] 
In addition, traffic has a strong impact 
on air quality. Recently, high pollution 
levels have made clear the need for a 
profound transformation in the regional 
public transportation system, for which 
comprehensive  policies  and  large 
investments are required. 

Although 70 percent of daily trips are 
made by public transportation, service is 
exceeded by demand because, despite 

the great efforts made in recent years, 
public transportation service is not yet 
homogeneously  and  equitable  distri-
buted.[89] To discourage the use of private 
cars,  CDMX´s  public  transportation 
system needs to offer commutes with high 
standards of quality, efficiency, and safety.

Any traffic transformation requires the 
city  to  focus  on  sustainable  models 
that benefit mobility. Currently, CDMX 
has  made  progress  in  that  direction. 
One example is the CDMX New Mobility 
Model, which is based on 10 principles[90] 
that prioritize the most vulnerable users, 
such as pedestrians and cyclists. Bicycle 
usage  has  increased  as  bicycles  are 
increasingly recognized as an efficient 
means of transportation. Bicycles have 
an average travel speed of 10.19 miles per 
hour compared to the 9.3 miles per hour 
of cars,[91] and they do not emit pollution.

Road safety for pedestrians and cyclists 
has  become  worrisome,  as  traffic 
accidents have become the leading cause 
of death for people between the ages of 
5 and 30.[92]

90. The new vision outlined in the Comprehensive Mobility Program 2013 - 2018 is based on the following 10 principles: safety, 

accessibility, efficiency, equality, quality, resilience, multimodality, sustainability, low carbon, and participation and social co-

responsibility.

91. One of the main drivers for the use of the bicycle is the EcoBici program, which currently has 452 bike stations, 6,000 public 

114

bicycles, and 100,000 users in 43 neighborhoods in 43 city districts (EcoBici, 2016).

92. Between 2012 and 2015, 1,091 deaths were registered per year due to traffic accidents; 60 percent of the casualties were 

pedestrians (GDF, 2015).

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPILLAR 04. IMPROVE MOBILITYGOAL 4.1.
Promote an integrated mobility 
system that connects and revitalizes 
CDMX and ZMVM.

ACTION 4.1.1.
Improve infrastructure to create an integrated, accessible 
public transportation system for CDMX and ZMVM that includes 
service for people with disabilities and vulnerable groups.

This action will promote the Integrated 
Transport  System  (ITS),[94]  which  is 
a  key  tool  for  transforming  mobility. 
This  action  includes  upgrading  public 
transportation  units,  improving  the 
connections between different modes of 
transportation through building better 
infrastructure, unifying service standards, 
integrating rates and payment, as well 
as consolidating public transportation 
systems  under  a  single  authority  to 
strengthen institutional coordination. A 
long-term vision for regulation and control 
of the transportation system is needed 

Responsible Party: SEMOVI
Partners: ITDP, CTS Embarq
Period: 2016 – 2025

Resilience Value:
The  ITS  has  the  ability  to  transform 
mobility  in  CDMX  and  ZMVM,  and  to 
increase access to public transportation 
in  response  to  the  specific  needs  of 
different groups. Increasing access to 
public transportation will positively impact 
the city´s competitiveness.

ACTION 4.1.2 
Establish policies and pilot projects to promote transportation-
oriented urban development.

Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a 
strategy to create dense neighborhoods 
with a mix of concentrated uses around 
mass public transportation.[95] This strategy 
creates a compact, dynamic, and equitable 
city  with  accessible  environments  for 
cyclists and pedestrians—all connected 
to a public mass transportation network. 
CDMX is developing strategic projects, 
such  as  recovery  and  redesign  for 
Intermodal Transfer Centers (CETRAM), 
and is integrating TOD strategies into the 
new Urban Development General Program 
(PGDU) for specific areas of the city, with 
a focus on the development of housing, 
services, urban amenities, and jobs related 
to public transportation.

Responsible Party:  SEMOVI-SEDUVI
Partners: ITDP, CTS Embarq, RMS
Period: 2016 – 2025

Resilience Value:
The TOD strategy will allow CDMX to 
create a more compact city, with more 
jobs and a greater housing density, and 
to reduce commute times and the use 
of private cars. This strategy will have a 
positive impact on the quality of life of 
everyone in CDMX.

ACTIVITY 4.1.2.2. Integrate TOD 
principles in all urban development 
projects in cooperation-based action 
systems (SAC).

Urban renewal projects will be integrated 
into the PGDU under the auspices of SAC 
and AGE as the city´s strategic areas 
for potential economic development 
and integration of urban infrastructure, 
housing,  services,  and  employment 
connected  to  the  transportation 
network. One or more of the following 
strategic areas will be selected for pilot 
studies on the  integration of TOD and 
resilience principles: Heritage zone AGE 
Xochimilco - Tlahuac and Milpa Alta and 
Iztapalapa, SAC Alameda Reforma, La 
Mexicana, Tacubaya, Doctors Buenos 
Aires, Distrito San Pablo, Atlampa and

ACTION 4.1.3.
Expand and innovate the consolidated public transportation 
network.

The  development  of  the  public 
transportation network and improvements 
to  the  existing  infrastructure  must  be 
accelerated at the metropolitan level to 
expand  access  and  connectivity.  This 
can be achieved by applying innovative 
technologies  to  public  transportation 
systems,  such  as  aerial  public 
transportation, electric transportation, and 
other clean transportation technologies.

Responsible Parties:  SEMOVI
Partners:  ITDP, CTS Embarq, UNAM
Period: 2016 – 2025

Resilience Value:
This action contributes to a transformation 
of the CDMX mobility system to achieve 
a  new  metropolitan  vision  of  a  public 
transportation  network  that  is  more 
reliable,  enhances  access,  reduces 
traffic jams and air pollution, and results 
in  a  paradigm  shift  through  public 
transportation system innovations. 

FEATURED ACTIVITY 4.1.3.1. Widen the coverage of the 
consolidated public transportation network to areas in 
CDMX and the ZMVM with high demand and a lack of 
access.

Investments in the expansion of the structured public transportation system should 
be prioritized in a coordinated manner at a metropolitan level. Investments should be 
made in areas of CDMX with higher demand and marginalized populations to improve 
their quality of life and the air they breathe. In these areas of the city, multimodal 
commuting options should be increased to discourage the use of private cars.

Investments in public transportation in CDMX and the ZMVM continue to be insufficient. 
Structured transportation[96] with exclusive lanes covers only 39 percent of the urban 
area.[97] In the coming years it will be necessary to cover the infrastructure lag on 
a metropolitan scale with the expansion of the Metrobus system and the Collective 
Subway System Network (SCM)[98] and its connection with the Mexibus (State of 
Mexico) system. In addition, with the construction of the NAICM, extension of  the 
SCM line B (Buenavista - Airport) becomes possible.

Discourage the use of private cars.

GOAL 4.3.
Create a safe and accessible city for 
pedestrians and cyclists.

ACTION 4.2.1.
Promote pedestrian, cyclist, and public transportation mobility 
over private transportation mobility.

Currently,  in  CDMX  projects  such  as 
Ecoparq and Hoy no circula (one day 
without  a  car),  programs  are  in  place 
that aim to discourage car use and, in 
contrast,  promote  resilience  building 
through public transportation-oriented, 
comprehensive  urban  development. 
In  addition,  the  possibility  of  creating 
Ecozonas  (ecological  areas)  in  places 
like the Historical City Center is being 
explored. Implementing exclusive lanes 
for cars with more than three passengers 
and enforcing the law of Minimum vs. 
Maximum [99] in parking lots are also being 
considered.

Responsible Parties: SEMOVI
Partners: C40, Fundación Carlos Slim, 
ITDP, CTS Embarq
Period: 2016-2025

Resilience Value:
By modifying the hierarchy of mobility 
priorities, problems such as traffic jams 
and lack of access to public transportation 
are reduced, and improving the air and 
quality  of  life  of  CDMX  inhabitants 
becomes possible. 

ACTION 4.3.1.
Implement the Vision Zero initiative.

The  government  of  CDMX,  with  the 
support of the Vision Zero Coalition,[100] 
the  Swedish  Embassy,  and  the  Inter-
Amercan  Development  Bank  (BID),  is 
implementing Vision Zero CDMX with 
the aim of deterring the loss of human 
lives  caused  by  traffic  accidents.  This 
initiative includes five elements: 1) road 
safety strategy, 2) road users training, 
3)  infrastructure  that  saves  lives,  4) 
justice, and 5) creation of a single traffic 
control information system, the Vision 
Zero  data  system.  Implementing  the 
Vision  Zero  initiative  has  accelerated 
the implementation of other initiatives, 
such as Programa Integral de Seguridad 
Vial (Integrated Road Safety Program), 
Pasos Seguros (Safe Steps), Red por la 
Seguridad Vial (Network for Road Safety), 
and the pilot program Llega seguro (Safe 
arrival) in 13 schools.

Responsible Parties:  SEMOVI
Partners: BID, Coalición Visión Cero
Period: 2016 – 2025

Resilience Value:
This goal of this initiative is to create a 
safer city for pedestrians and cyclists, to 
reduce the number of injuries and deaths 
caused by car accidents, and to encourage 
and support community participation in 
the development of a road etiquette. 

ACTIVITY 4.3.1.1. Create the Center 
for Road Safety.

CDMX builds the CDMX Vision Zero 
data system because the recording 
of deaths and serious injuries from 
traffic accidents is inconsistent. The 
SEMOVI works to create a system that 
allows information collecting as well as 
measuring and evaluating the results of 
the Vision Zero initiative. To enhance 
communication and information on 
mobility  issues,  the  system  will  be 
accessible  to  the  public.  The  Road 
Safety Center will serve as a focal point 
for consolidating data, strengthening 
decision  making,  and  generating 
communication strategies and public 
involvement.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPILLAR 04. IMPROVE MOBILITYINSPIRATION: VISION ZERO NEW YORK CITY.

In 2014, the New York City Department of Transportation established the Vision 
Zero Strategy because, in the 10 years prior to 2014, nearly 1,500 pedestrians 
and 190 cyclists lost their lives due to traffic accidents, and 15,000 others were 
severely injured.

The Vision Zero Strategy focuses on three main points: 1) any death or injury on 
the streets is unacceptable; 2) deaths and injuries caused by traffic accidents are 
preventable; 3) safe behavior should be expected of all citizens, and everyone 
must participate in cultural change. Specifically, the strategy focuses on making 
the streets safer through public dialogue and education, law enforcement, 
street design, and legislation. Citizens collaborated on the creation of each of 
these elements.

Between 2014 and 2015, fatalities related to traffic accidents dropped to 252, 
the lowest number ever reported in New York City’s history. Moreover, since 
the first year of its implementation, the program has transformed the city’s 
streets, increasing their safety and accessibility.

With respect to legislation, the speed limit was reduced to 24.8 miles per hour, 
and about 20,000 traffic monitoring units were installed. Eighty safe corridors 
and intersections have been completed, and 60 of them are located in priority 
sites. Furthermore, the redesign of four main corridors with the highest rates 
of traffic accidents has begun.

Under the Vision Zero Strategy, New York City will implement 50 projects each 
year to promote safety on the city’s streets. An example is a project at Hunts 
Point Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, an intersection where high rates of car 
crashes have been reported. Safety interventions such as islands, crosswalks, 
and extensions for sidewalks and medians were installed. Other streets where 
successful interventions were implemented are Queen´s Boulevard, Capital 
Concourse, Atlantic Avenue and 4th Avenue.

ACTION 4.3.2.
Transform public space to promote active mobility.

Active mobility refers to non-motorized 
commuting by pedestrians and cyclists. 
Transformation of public space through 
the construction of models of Complete 
Streets should consider the inclusion of 
urban infrastructure for active mobility. 
Communication  strategies  must  be 
integrated if the public is to be aware of 
and understand the health and economic 
benefits of active mobility.

Responsible Parties:  SEDEMA
Partners: ITDP, CTS Embarq
Period: 2016 – 2025

Resilience Value:
Active mobility has many positive impacts, 
such  as:  health  benefits,  public  space 
improvements, a reduction in car use, 
and decreases in vehicular pollution and 
traffic congestion.

ACTIVITY 4.3.2.1. Widen cycling 
infrastructure network.

The Government of CDMX is widening 
the cycling infrastructure network to 
encourage bicycle use in combination 
with other modes of transportation. 
The main initiatives are the creation 
of new bike lanes,[101] parking spaces 
for bikes, Complete Streets, and the 
expansion of the EcoBici system. The 
goal  is  to  make  streets  accessible, 
with  ramps  and  even  pavements, 
so that cyclists can navigate safely. 
Currently, SEMOVI plans projects such 
as Calle Chilanga (Chilanga Street) 
and Corredores Cero Emisiones (Zero 
Emissions Corridors) (Trolebici) on 
Avenue 8 South, Central Avenue, and 
Avenue 2. These projects will serve as 
models for promoting streets as public 
spaces.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPILLAR 04. IMPROVE MOBILITYACTION 4.4.2.
Improve mobility planning for emergency and 
disaster situations.

Because the city is exposed to earthquake 
hazards and other potential disasters, 
there  are  mitigation  measurements 
and  response  protocols  for  each  of 
the  different  transportation  systems. 
However, a comprehensive strategy is 
needed to ensure the smooth functioning 
of the city during emergencies and to 
improve communications and connections 
with  safety  areas  and  emergency 
responders.  Currently,  the  Ministry  of 
Civil  Protection  (SPC)  is  working  on 
developing cooperative agreements for 
free transit on urban highways during an 
emergency, accident, or disaster, and for 
proposing signaling and disseminating 
entry and evacuation routes to the drivers 
of emergency and support vehicles.

Responsible Parties: SEMOVI, SPC
Partners: CTS Embarq, ITDP, RMS,Veolia 
Period: 2016 – 2025

Resilience Value:
By consolidating CDMX mobility network 
response  protocols  and  mitigation 
measures for emergency and disaster 
situations, system recovery costs may 
be reduced, negative effects on public 
transportation  users  can  possibly  be 
prevented, and the continuity of a critical 
city service is ensured.

GOAL 4.4.
Prepare the mobility system for the 
potential risks and effects of climate 
change.

ACTION 4.4.1.
Adapt the public transportation system to the effects of climate 
change.

It is essential to ensure that the mobility 
system  has  the  ability  to  withstand 
disruptive or unexpected events and adapt 
to changing conditions. Transportation 
systems are constantly exposed to events, 
such as floods, which could occur more 
frequently  in  the  future.  The  mobility 
planning in this area must be strengthened 
to reduce recovery costs in case of an 
event and to enhance the effectiveness 
of the public transportation system.

Responsible Parties:  SEMOVI, SEDEMA
Partners:  ITDP, CTS Embarq, RMS
Period: 2016 – 2018

Resilience Value:
Making adjustments to the city’s mass 
public  transportation  network  before 
effects associated with climate change 
occur (e.g., intense flooding, heat waves) 
helps  avoid  damaging  impacts  to  the 
network’s operation and reduces risks to 
users.

ACTIVITY 4.4.1.1. Assess the effect 
of heat waves and floods in STCM 
and Metrobus transportation 
systems, and create a portfolio of 
adjustment measures for public 
transportation.

In  order  to  create  an  adjustment 
strategy  to  address  the  effects  of 
climate change, proposals for STCM 
and  Metrobus  will  be  generated 
and analyzed. These proposals can 
provide a basis for the development 
of a portfolio of adjustment measures 
before the effects of climate change 
occur.  The  analysis  will  integrate, 
for example, information on historic 
data and flooding and waterlogging 
scenarios. This methodology could 
be replicated for other transportation 
systems. This activity will make the 
mass  transportation  system  more 
efficient and robust.

Promote the use of data to improve 
mobility decision making.

ACTION 4.5.1.
Promote public-private partnerships to encourage mobility 
data use.

Resilience Value:
Data  usage  through  data  exchange 
platforms, data management, and the 
creation of digital tools can improve the 
decision making involved in the creation of 
effective public policies that are crucial to 
successful development of a more reliable 
mobility system.

CDMX generates an enormous amount 
of  data  daily;  however,  not  all  of  that 
data is available to the public. There are 
private companies with critical data and 
information that could be used to expand 
understanding of mobility patterns, which 
could,  in  turn,  inform  transportation 
mobility planning and decision making. 
Access  to  information  has  multiple 
benefits for different sectors. There is a 
potential opportunity to establish public-
private partnerships that can strengthen 
access, collection, distribution, and use 
of information.

The Laboratory for the City (LabCDMX) 
and  other  organizations  implemented 
the  Mapatón  program,  which  is  an 
unprecedented collective effort based 
on users collaborating in the creation of 
open mobility databases.

ACTIVITY 4.5.1.3. Implement 
projects that support shared mobility 
in universities and companies.

At the end of 2014, a Mexico City team, 
led by a911, won the International Audi 
Urban Future Award 2014 contest. The 
proposal suggested an alternative for 
reviewing and understanding the role of 
private cars and the possibility of their 
being part of the transportation solution, 
not just a mobility problem. 

Through  partnerships  created  with 
more than 43 participants and the data 
obtained through these, the proposal 
managed to take a first step towards the 
creation of a mobility agreement among 
the different participants.

During 2015, collaboration agreements 
with six companies and institutions in 
the  Santa Fe area were formalized, and 
mobility patterns and behaviors were

studied to identify possible solutions 
and recommendations. Currently, the 
aim  is to strengthen and widen these 
partnerships  to  support  institutions 
and  corporations  in  optimizing  their 
resources, and promote sustainable work 
environments that improve employees´ 
quality  of  life.  An  agreement  on  a 
collaboration between neighborhood 
associations,  the  private  sector,  the 
public  sector,  and  Audi  to  promote 
mobility  transformation  is  being 
pursued..

Metrocable is an aerial public transportation system in Medellin. The system 
consists of several interconnected lines that supplement the subway lines. This 
project has a social element, as it focuses on improving the living conditions 
of low-income users living in the most deprived and unsafe areas of the city 
through urban design strategies that promote accessibility to transportation, 
public space, and urban amenities.

ESTRATEGIA DE RESILIENCIA100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPILLAR 05. DEVELOP INNOVATION AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITYIn the development of this strategy, in 
some cases existing regulations may need 
to be reviewed to facilitate the promotion 
of adaptive measures by government and 
society. 

For  public  resources  to  be  able  to 
contribute to building resilience, potential 
barriers  need  to  be  identified  and 
alternatives found. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT

CDMX faces a variety of dynamic risks that 
may bring about human and economic 
losses.  These  risks  may  also  result  in 
impacts on the provision of basic services 
or reduce quality of life. The adaptive 
capacity  of  society,  institutions,  and 
strategic infrastructure must therefore 
be strengthened.

The  concept  of  adaptation  refers  to 
measures and adjustments in natural or 
human  systems  in  response  to  actual 
or expected stimuli, or their effects, in 
order to moderate damage and exploit 
any  beneficial  opportunities.[102]  The 
scientific community has recognized that 
adaptive challenges cannot be addressed 
through traditional responses, but require 
a constant process of learning, evaluation, 
and change.[103]

Cities  are  recognized  as  centers 
of  innovation  that  can  generate 
transformations  in  their  relationships 
and interactions with social-ecological 
systems. Cities, as centers of innovation, 
are ideally positioned to build a sustainable 
future,[104] since innovation is essential for 
adaptation of the strategic infrastructure 
upon which  the provision of basic urban 
services depends

Risk  assessment 
for  strategic 
infrastructure can be a valuable tool for 
making decisions about risk reduction and 
transfer. Additionally, large infrastructure 
projects such as the NAICM offer a valuable 
opportunity for the development of the 
city and the region. Investments linked to 
these projects should be strengthened by 
incorporating the principles of resilience 
(Figure  19)  from  initial  construction 
through all stages of design.

The intensification of the disaster risks 
associated  with  climate  change  and 
other dynamic processes is a challenge 
for the public and private sectors. Their 
capacity to address these risks may be 
exceeded, forcing them to turn to external 
support. To address this challenge, the 
government of CDMX created the Fund 
for Assistance with Natural Disasters in 
Mexico City (FONADEN) in 2015, with 
an initial budget of 3 billion pesos (USD 
$162 million). The city is the first in the 
country to have a fund of this type, 30 
percent of which is intended to address 
disasters such as earthquakes and floods. 
The private sector is also participating 
through strategic partnerships with the 
city, which can improve overall response 
and reduce losses. Innovative, inclusive, 
and flexible solutions are required, such 
as risk transfer instruments that allow 
early recovery, continuity of operations, 
independence  of  public  support,  and 
improved reconstruction.

It is essential to promote the adaptive 
capacities of citizens, which will enable 
them  to  respond  in  an  organized 
way  in  the  event  of  emergencies  and 
which  will  strengthen  social  cohesion 
and  responsibility  at  the  community 
level, reduce domestic risks, and scale 
up  resilience.  The  implementation  of 
public policies for disaster relief should 
concentrate  on  the  most  vulnerable 
groups, as these policies will generate 
improvements in quality of life regardless 
of the risks to which these groups are 
exposed.

102. This definition of adaptation is presented in the General Law on Climate Change (Official Gazette of the Federation (DOF), 

132

2012a), which refers to climatic stimuli; however, it has been modified to include other possible stimuli.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYPILLAR 05. DEVELOP INNOVATION AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITYGOAL 5.1.
Integrate the principles of resilience 
in public facilities, investments, and 
new strategic projects, and promote 
private-sector participation in 
building resilience.

ACTION 5.1.1.
Foster innovation for integrated risk management.

This  action  seeks  to  strengthen  the 
integrated risk management in CDMX 
through  innovative  mechanisms  for 
assessment, reduction, and risk transfer 
by which participation is encouraged in 
various sectors, both public and private.   

Responsible Parties: SEFIN, SEDECO
Partners: BM, SwissRe, RMS, Veolia
Period: 2016-2025

Resilience Value:

By  expanding  the  options  for  sharing 
risks and strengthening the culture of 
insurance,  it  is  possible  to  reduce  the 
economic impact of disasters to which 
the city is exposed, and ensure continuity 
of activities that support the financial well-
being of families.

FEATURED ACTIVITY  5.1.1.1. Promote disaster risk transfer 
alternatives for CDMX: World Bank initiative of risk transfer 
for resilient cities.

This joint initiative between the World Bank and 100RC is aimed at working with 
cities that are part of a network that is building a strategy for the integrated 
management of catastrophic risks. In addition, it aims to provide technical advice 
to the city regarding transfer of part of its catastrophic risk resulting from disasters 
via the World Bank platform in order to have immediate liquidity after a disaster 
of great magnitude. Financial protection, which is a central pillar of comprehensive 
risk management, consists of the following:

• 

• 

• 

• 

Assess the risk: define and measure contingent liabilities; assess and quantify 
the risk of disasters. 
Develop a comprehensive strategy: take into account the frequency and severity 
of disasters, develop a cost-efficient strategy of financing risk, and improve the 
budgetary response capability once disasters occur without compromising the 
sustainability of public finances.
Allocate resources efficiently: establish effective administrative and legal systems 
for approval, transfer, and monitoring of funds after disasters.
Reduce the risk: scale down contingent liabilities due to disasters, reduce 
the impact of disasters through the integration of risk information in public 
investment, and reduce economic impacts by creating incentives for private-
sector resilience.

The aim is to contribute to the efforts being made in CDMX, such as the recently 
created FONADEN, to complement the proposals by various sectors and achieve 
coordination among projects for a more efficient deployment of resources. By 
improving understanding of the city’s resources for responding to disasters, particularly 
large-scale disasters, the proactive planning and management of the response to 
emergencies and disasters can be strengthened to better facilitate rehabilitation and 
reconstruction.

The concept of resilience is new, even 
within the decision-making process. This 
action is therefore aimed at influencing 
construction projects in the operation and 
improvement of strategic infrastructure 
and public urban facilities so that these 
projects incorporate resilience qualities, 
recognize  the  risks  to  which  they  are

Resilience Value:

This action helps promote a multifunctional 
information  infrastructure  that  can 
reduce risks to the population, ensure 
continuity of basic services, and improve 
the environment and quality of life of the 
inhabitants of CDMX.

ACTIVITY 5.1.2.3. Perform a risk and 
resilience analysis for strategic 
public facilities.

At  an  early  stage,  a  study  will  be 
developed of the seismic risk of public 
facilities that provide basic services 
for the city. This will include: all CDMX 
markets, the Central Supply Station 
(Central de Abasto), modal transfer 
centers (CETRAMs), and major roads. 
This work will be carried out by RMS 
as part of the services provided by the 
platform of partners of 100RC. Once 
this first stage is concluded, analysis 
of other possible low-frequency, high-
severity  risks  will  be  pursued,  and 
this methodology will be replicated 
in the evaluation of other strategic 
infrastructure.

RISK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS INC: 
Preliminary results of seismic risk analysis for public 
markets in CDMX.

A sophisticated approach to measuring 
extreme  risk  is  necessary  to  increase 
the  resilience  of  the  city’s  strategic 
public  facilities.  That  measurement  is 
complicated because disasters can occur 
unexpectedly and can vary in duration 
and intensity.

analytical  approach  also  provides  an 
opportunity to identify where investments 
in  resilience  can  be  more  productive; 
for example, considering the profile of 
resilience from multiple perspectives only, 
four markets have been highlighted, as 
shown in Figure 24.

Furthermore,  this  analysis,  performed 
with  limited  information  on  exposure, 
demonstrates  the  importance  of 
having high-quality data on public and 
private property in the city. Intelligent 
assumptions can be derived from models, 
but the more complete and accurate the 
exposure data, the more accurate the 
results. From the modeling of resilience, 
the  cost-benefit  of  investments  in 
resilience for individual markets can be 
identified,  and  the  modeling  can  also 
facilitate a holistic vision of the recovery 
capacity  that  includes  other  dangers, 
such as terrorism, infectious diseases, 
and drought.

This approach can be used to analyze 
other sections of critical infrastructure 
in the city, such as the network of modal 
transfer centers (CETRAMs) and roads, 
and to discover and quantify the complex 
interdependencies between the city assets 
and the risks that they face.

Probabilistic  models  of  loss  due  to  a 
catastrophe  can  be  applied  when  a 
disaster occurs. Based on a simulation 
of  about  100,000  projections  for  the 
following year, which results in an estimate 
of the severity of potential losses based on 
a series of probabilities, these models can 
be used to quantify the current resilience 
of the city and to set a realistic goal for 
resilience in the future.

Various sectors of the CDMX government 
are  working  with  RMS  on  evaluating 
the  possible  impacts  on  strategic 
public facilities in the event of a major 
earthquake.  The  preliminary  analysis 
shown  here,  which  characterizes  the 
resilience of the network of nearly 300 
public markets in the event of a major 
earthquake, is an example of the results 
that can be obtained from this effort.

The exceedance probability curve shows 
that a seismic event, such as the one that 
occurred in 1985, is not the worst-possible 
scenario for the city. Actually, there is a 
1 percent chance that markets will suffer 
losses five times greater than those that 
were modeled for the 1985 earthquake, 
and a still substantial likelihood that the 
losses will be even ten times higher. This

ACTION 5.1.3.
Promote  private-sector  participation  in  building  urban 
resilience.

The government response to disasters 
or emergencies is strengthened by the 
participation of the private sector in the 
response. Collaboration with the private 
sector expands government capabilities 
and  enhances  disaster  recovery.  The 
purpose  of  this  action  is  to  identify 
economic activities that may be affected 
by a disaster and to share responsibility 
with the private sector for the decision-
making  process  on  issues  of  risk 
prevention and reduction, performance 
during emergencies, and reconstruction 
improvements.

Private sector involvement in the various 
stages of planning in the event of a disaster 
(prevention, preparedness, recovery, and 
reconstruction) improves the response by 
government, reduces disaster impacts,

information to the public and that allows 
community networks for the construction 
of urban resilience and adaptive capacities.

Resilience Value:

This  action  provides  information  in  a 
timely  and  adequate  manner  to  help 
the public address risks, increase their

ACTIVITY 5.2.1.1. Create a platform to facilitate the communication of risk 
information to the public and to enable citizens to build citizen networks for 
improving adaptive capacities and building urban resilience.

The international community has gained 
experience in the field of risk reduction 
for disasters.[105] In Sendai Framework 
2015–2030,  the  need  for  a  broad 
preventive approach towards disaster 
risks, an approach that is more focused 
on people, is acknowledged;[106] this is 
reflected in one of seven global goals: 
“Considerably increase the availability of 
early alert systems on multiple threats 
and information and assessments on 
disaster risk communicated to people, 
and access thereto, by 2030.”[107]

A  positive  correlation  between 
transparency  of  information  on  risk 
assessment and the competitiveness 
of cities has been recognized.[108] Some 
of  these  cities,  recognized  as  more 
competitive internationally, match those 
cities that promote data sharing and risk 
communication.[109]

In this context, several organizations 
have developed open communication 
platforms  for  the  public  on  various 
risks in different regions or countries. In 
addition, several cities around the world 
are working to create platforms that 
allow their citizens to learn of risks where 
they live and prepare for emergencies. 
For example, the City of San Francisco, 
USA, has an Internet platform that shares 

information on risks within the city and 
local region, and helps city residents 
and the general public to prepare for 
emergencies.

The  City  of  San  Francisco’s  Internet 
platform  shares  information  on  risk 
assessment, action plans for different 
events, and a geographical information 
system  where  individuals  can  look 
up  the  risks  they  are  exposed  to  by 
location. San Francisco’s platform also 
has various applications that promote 
citizen participation in building resilience 
on a routine basis; for example, there 
is a dynamic database where different 
groups  in  the  community  can  share 
real-time  information  about  what  is 
happening  in  the  city.  Additionally, 
a  neighborhood  empowerment 
network[110] was created, which includes 
information on neighborhood meetings 
for preparing working plans that improve 
neighborhood  resilience,  plans  that 
are shared with other neighborhoods 
through the Internet.

105. The disaster risk reduction was promoted internationally from the “International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction” 

in the 1990s, culminating in the Hyogo Framework for Action: Increased resilience of nations and communities in the event of 

disasters, approved at the “World Conference on Disaster Reduction” in 2005. One of the objectives of this document was 

to increase the availability of adequate and reliable information on disasters, not only for decision makers, but for the general 

population (UN, 2005).

Strengthen the technical capacity of civil servants to build 
resilience.

Resilience depends largely on the ability 
of  people  to  be  prepared,  transform 
themselves, respond, and survive in the 
face of destructive events that can occur 
in the place where they live.

Responsible Parties: EAP y OR
Period: 2016-2018 

Resilience Value:

This  is  particularly  important  for  civil 
servants, who are responsible for meeting 
the needs of others during emergencies, 
so  it  is  necessary  to  strengthen  their 
capacities.

Building  the  response  capacities  of 
civil servants helps them make critical 
decisions in emergency situations and 
prioritize assistance to the population. 
This knowledge also helps civil servants 
to create long-term public policies that 
increase the security of citizens.

ACTION 5.2.3.
Encourage citizen participation and communication of priority 
resilience issues.

This  action  consists  of  implementing 
communication campaigns on topics that 
contribute to building the city’s resilience, 
so  that  citizens  become  aware  of  the 
actions that are being carried out and 
which they can join, and inviting them 
to actively participate in the resilience 
building effort. Initially, the issues to be 
promoted based on their importance in 
building resilience are: Vision Zero, water 
poverty, and protection and care of green 
areas.

INSPIRATION: REBUILD BY DESIGN – WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD A 
MORE RESILIENT REGION.

Rebuild by Design (RBD) can collaborate with CDMX in the introduction of a 
collaborative design process for planning and specific problem solving—a process 
that contributes to improving urban and regional resilience. RBD emerged from 
the call for a design contest for the reconstruction of areas affected by Hurricane 
Sandy in New York, and has evolved into the promoter of an innovative process 
that generates practical solutions to complex problems.

The purpose is not only to invite sectors that were usually excluded from urban 
planning solutions, but to place them in the middle of a solid, interdisciplinary, 
and creative design process that generates innovative responses.

The RBD process is carried out in a series of successive and connected stages 
that are established to maintain cross collaboration among sectors, academic 
strength, and a mobile design and that result in an easily replicable process. 
Based on the success of this methodology in the city of New York, RBD’s goal 
has been to establish it as a model for designing resilience solutions to problems 
in other cities.

This methodology has been considered a paradigm shift in the way governments 
and those responsible for urban planning consider emergency preparedness and 
disaster response. RBD relies on collaboration among designers, researchers, 
community members, and government officials in a process that proposes 
solutions to problems, solutions that take into account physical, social, and 
ecological factors.

In addition to increasing risk awareness in society, RBD has an important 
connection to the community during the implementation process and explores 
the need for changes in policies and regulatory structure to improve resilience 
building.

Develop initiatives focused on vulnerable groups.

Some social groups are more vulnerable 
to  disaster  events  than  the  average 
population due to conditions that may 
be permanent or dynamic. These factors 
contribute to vulnerability: age (dependent 
children, older adults who need special 
help in emergencies), gender, economic 
conditions  (poverty,  unemployment, 
homelessness),  location  (ravines,  dry 
stream beds), and social situation (lack of 
social cohesion, exclusion), among others. 
Initiatives that reduce the vulnerability 
stemming from these factors should be 
developed.

everyone’s quality of life.

INSPIRATION: RIO DE JANEIRO STRATEGY: FEATURED ACTION - 
EDUCATE CHILDREN FOR RESILIENCE. 

In the Rio de Janeiro Strategy for Resilience, the action of educating children 
for resilience is highlighted. The project seeks to develop and implement urban 
resilience topics to complement civil protection concepts in the curriculum of 
the municipal schools. Resilience topics were recently included in an educational 
program that is currently benefitting around 5,000 children aged 10 to 12 years. 
It is estimated that this complementary project will benefit 100,000 students 
by 2020.

Content is included on the following three topics:

•  

• 
• 

Impact of climate change on cities and how it affects the lives of young 
people.
Basic civil protection concepts and disaster preparedness.
Sustainable consumption and resource efficiency, particularly regarding 
energy and water; introduction of recycling fundamentals and the 
processing of materials and products.

The project believes that children should become aware of the risks they 
are exposed to in their neighborhood and city, and should develop resilient 
behaviors in their youth. This project will create awareness and promote a 
culture of risk prevention and mitigation, and it will also foster environmental 
and civic responsibility.

government (10 percent commitment).

As  mentioned  in  Chapter  III  of  this 
document, in November 2015, the CDMX 
government committed to allocate 10 
percent of the expenditures budget to 
building resilience. This action fulfills the 
commitment to pursue investments in 
resilience that are transformative. The 
actions  of  all  government  institutions 
that contribute to the resilience of the city 
must be acknowledged, and programs and 
projects that make resilience investments 
safer, inclusive, and sustainable must also 
be promoted.

CHAPTER I.  INTRODUCTION100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYVI. NEXT STEPS

After adoption of the CDMX Resilience Strategy by the Resilience Steering Committee 
(Comité Directivo de Resiliencia) of the CICCDF, the implementation stage will begin. 
This stage will be an inclusive process; stakeholders from government, the private 
sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the scientific community will 
participate as responsible parties and partners in specific activities within the framework 
of the five pillars for creating resilience in the CDMX and the region.

The path toward the creation of resilience is a process that involves continuous learning 
to address the multiple risks that the city is exposed to in a dynamic environment. The 
creation of an MRV system will be a key element in establishing periodic evaluations 
and facilitating continuous learning, because the MRV system will be linked to the 
Monitoring of the CDMX Climate Change Action Program (SSPACCM). Inclusion of 
NGOs in implementation actions and the MRV system would be innovative and address 
the need to share responsibilities.

Building resilience is a process that uses long-term planning and implementation 
actions to meet the Resilience Strategy goals. The Resilience Office for CDMX will 
pursue the following objectives:

•  Coordinate transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary work for designing, implementing, 

monitoring, and evaluating the Resilience Strategy goals and actions.

•  Provide innovative solutions to existing and potential resilience challenges in the 

• 

city and the region.
Identify and promote the implementation of global best practices for resilience 
in the city.

•  Provide technical assistance and collaboration to 100RC partners.
•  Promote the incorporation of the principles of resilience in public planning and 

actions at different levels of government (boroughs, city, and the region).

•  Promote regional coordination and create collaborative mechanisms between 

different levels of government on critical resilience issues.

•  Promote agreements between stakeholders from different sectors and public-
private collaborations to reduce chronic stresses and improve responsiveness 
to shocks.

•  Promote citizen communication, education, and participation campaigns to build 

and strengthen resilience in society.

•  Monitor the Government of Mexico City’s on its commitment to allocate 10 percent 

of public expenditures to actions that contribute to resilience improvements.

 
Resilience will be built in the city through joint efforts; thus, continued support from 
the institutions and organizations that have been identified so far will be essential. In 
addition, the Resilience Strategy is a living process that will continue to identify new 
resilience opportunities and stakeholders interested in and committed to joining this 
collective and inclusive effort to create a resilient CDMX and region.

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYCHAPTER VII. 05. DEVELOP INNOVATION AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY / APPENDIXGLOSSARY

Assets: Tangible assets owned by the 
city, categorized as elements or systems 
that are an essential part of its operation 
and are key to sustaining the quality of 
life of the city’s inhabitants. Assets can 
be economic, environmental, social, or 
technological  infrastructure  in  nature, 
or they can be urban amenities. Urban 
resilience  is  highly  dependent  on  the 
proper functioning of its assets.[111]

Adaptation: Measures and adjustments 
performed on natural or human systems 
in response to climatic stimuli or their 
effects, actual or expected, which can 
moderate damage or take advantage of 
their beneficial aspects.[112]

Strategic  Management  Areas  (AGE): 
Are  planning  tools  used  in  the  public 
interest  for  regional  planning  to 
promote  the  renewal,  requalification 
and revitalization of specific areas in a 
city.  They  meet  the  requirements  for 
regulatory and management tools, and 
are used to develop specific areas that 
need strategic action for regeneration, 
restructuring,  and  requalification  and 
urban and environmental revitalization. 
Each AGE will be handled by a specific, 
authorized agency.[113]

Adaptive  capacity:  The  capacity  of 
systems, institutions, human beings, and 
government agencies to adapt to possible 
damage, seize opportunities, and respond 
to emergencies and disasters. [114]

Strategic  infrastructure:  Essential 
infrastructure for the delivery of public 
goods and services whose destruction or 
disabling would threaten public safety.[115] 

Impact: Sudden and abrupt events that 
threaten a city. Examples: large-magnitude 
earthquakes, hurricanes, torrential rains, 
floods, heat or cold waves, fire, hazardous 
materials accidents, tornadoes, terrorism, 
epidemic outbreaks, riot / civil unrest, and 
infrastructure failure, among others. [116]

Resilience:  Capacity  of  individuals, 
communities, businesses and systems 
within a city to survive, adapt, and grown 
no matter what kinds of chronic stresses
and acute shocks they experience.[117]

Risk:  Probable  damage  or  losses  to  a 
susceptible  entity,  resulting  from  the 
interaction between its vulnerability and 
the presence of a disruptive agent. [118]

Cooperation-Based Performance System 
(SAC): A legal tool to deliver projects and 
specific infrastructure, urban amenities, 
public space, and other elements that 
provide  direct  benefits  to  people  and 
the environment in specific urban areas. 
This  system  is  implemented  through 
developing  an  urban  strategy  that  is 
based on the contributions of various 
private, public, and other stakeholders 
who influence the region. [119]

Environmental  services:  Ecological 
processes  of  natural  ecosystems  that 
provide  a  range  of  cost-free  benefits 
and services upon which humans rely: air 
and water quality maintenance, control of 
the hydrological cycle, water generation 
and soil conservation, carbon storage, 
parasite and disease vector control, and 
preservation of recreational areas.[120]

Transformation:  A  change  in  the 
fundamental  attributes  of  natural  and 
human systems. A transformation may 
occur  in  technological  or  biological 
systems,  in  financial  structures,  or  in 
regulatory, statutory, or administrative 
law based on paradigms; transformation 
often takes place by adjusting paradigms, 
goals, or values. [122]

Conservation  Area:  An  area  that 
maintains natural ecosystems, such as 
forests, grasslands, mountains, bodies 
of water, as well as agricultural areas. A 
Conservation Area produces a significant 
number of environmental services that are 
essential to the city—economic, cultural, 
and public services that the Conservation 
Area conserves and protects. [121]

Stresses:  Factors  that  weaken  city 
infrastructure  daily  or  cyclically. 
Examples  include  lack  of  access  to 
affordable housing, high and widespread 
unemployment, poverty and inequality, 
deteriorating infrastructure, water and air 
pollution, drought and water shortages, 
public  safety  threats  and  violence, 
social  instability,  and  deteriorating 
macroeconomic conditions. 

Adaptive transformation: Adjustment of 
the fundamental attributes of a system 
in response to climate change and its 
effects.[123] 

Vulnerability: Describes the degree of 
resistance or susceptibility of an asset 
with respect to the impacts of natural 
disasters and related technological and 
environmental  disasters.  The  degree 
of  vulnerability  is  determined  by  a 
combination  of  factors,  including:  the 
existing  awareness  of  these  dangers, 
conditions  that  affect  housing  and 
infrastructure, public and administrative 
policy,  as  well  as  the  presence  of 
organizational skills in all fields related 
to disaster management. Poverty is also 
one of the main causes of vulnerability in 
most parts of the world.[124]

100 RESILIENT CITIES:  MEXICO CITYRESILIENCE STRATEGY  /  REFERENCESACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The CDMX Resilience Strategy was made possible thanks to the support of the Federal District 
Inter-Agency Committee on Climate Change (CICCDF) and the creation of the Resilience Steering 
Committee, which consisted of the Mayor of Mexico City, SEDEMA, SEDECO, SEDESA, SEDESO, 
SEDUVI, SEMOVI, SPC, SSP, AEP, CAEPCMM, and SACMEX, with the participation of members 
of the public, the scientific community and the private sector. The support of stakeholders from 
all these sectors is appreciated.

Development of the CDMX Resilience Strategy required the involvement of many agencies, and 
it was finally completed because of the efforts of all those individuals who contributed to its 
development. The contributions of the following are particularly appreciated:
