About 100 Resilient Cities

100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the Rockefeller 
Foundation (100RC) helps cities around the world 
prepare to meet the physical, social and economic 
challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. 
Melbourne was selected from 372 applicant cities 
around the world to be among the first wave of 
32 cities to join the 100RC network.

100RC offers each member city:
•  funding for a Chief Resilience Officer, 
to coordinate resilience-building efforts

•  expert support to develop a resilience strategy
•  membership in a global network of peer cities 

to share ideas and solutions

•  use of the 100RC Platform – a group of leading 

service providers who offer in-kind support to 
member cities.

Resilient Melbourne sets out the first resilience strategy for Greater Melbourne. It is a joint project of 
32 metropolitan Melbourne councils, Melbourne’s academic, business and community sectors, and the 
Victorian Government, all supported by 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. 
This strategy was published by the City of Melbourne, May 2016.

WELCOME AND 
OVERVIEW

Resilient Melbourne marks an important point in Melbourne’s development. 
It presents the first of our city’s resilience strategies: a starting point that brings 
together individuals and organisations critical to the resilience of Melbourne and 
its diverse communities. It offers a new way to deal with the chronic stresses and 
acute shocks we are likely to experience, and to achieve our vision of a city that 
is viable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous, today and long into the future.

This strategy is the result of the work of more 
than 1,000 individuals from 230 organisations, 
Melbourne’s 32 local councils, and many 
Victorian Government departments. We thank 
everyone involved for their commitment to this 
great collaboration.

This strategy alone will not secure that vision. But by 
publishing this strategy, we are taking this work to 
our communities, seeking the active involvement of 
people and organisations who want to help protect and 
improve the lives of Melburnians: from individuals and 
small community groups to our largest institutions 
and corporations.

We invite you to tell us how you are helping to 
strengthen Melbourne as it prepares for the future. Let 
us know about new ways of working, or projects that 
could transform parts of the city for the better. We 
continue to seek additional partners for many of the 
actions set out here, and we will need to develop many 
more. We look forward to working with you.

WELCOME AND OVERVIEW

The Introduction (p. 7) explains the origins of Resilient 
Melbourne and why urban resilience is important, 
both globally and locally. Melbourne in context (p. 16) 
describes the progression of our city, from the land 
of traditional owners to the multicultural and modern 
metropolis it is today, including the chronic stresses and 
acute shocks that we face.

This sets the scene for why we are pursuing our four 
resilience objectives, each of which reflects an area 
where local government can take a leading role in 
building a more resilient Melbourne, in partnership with 
other sectors. These objectives are shown in the diagram 
on page 5 and are described in more detail on pages 
37-53. The diagram also sets out how we will achieve 
these objectives, through four action areas that 
encourage collaboration between disciplines and sectors, 
to implement three flagship actions, 15 supporting 
actions and 15 aligned local actions (see below for 
definitions). This is all described in more detail in the 
sections Adapt (p. 60-87), Survive (p. 88-109), Thrive 
(p. 110-137) and Embed (p. 138-154). Throughout the 
document we also highlight how the 100RC network 
is contributing to Melbourne’s efforts in ‘learning from 
others’ and ‘100RC global network in action’. 

 

EXAMPLES OF MELBOURNE’S
CHRONIC STRESSES

•  Rapid population growth
•  Increasing social inequality
•  Increasing pressures on our natural assets
•  Unemployment, particularly among 

young people

•  Climate change
•  Increasing rates of alcoholism and 

family violence

EXAMPLES OF MELBOURNE’S 
ACUTE SHOCKS

•  Bushfires
•  Floods
•  Heatwaves
•  Disease pandemics
•  Infrastructure-related emergencies
•  Extremist acts, including cyber-crime

Types of actions in Resilient Melbourne

Flagship: 
Key initiatives with the potential 
for metropolitan-wide involvement 
and transformational outcomes.

Supporting: 
Initiatives with the potential to 
improve Melbourne’s resilience 
on a range of scales – some may 
affect only a few council areas, 
while others could apply across 
the metropolitan area.

Aligned: 
Existing initiatives that align with 
Resilient Melbourne principles 
and have the potential for further 
local government input.

WELCOME AND OVERVIEW

In developing this strategy, we have followed three 
guiding principles, agreed at the outset of our work: 
build on Melbourne’s existing structures and institutions; 
avoid duplication of effort and investment, and; deliver 
tangible benefits to our communities. Although 
achieving our long-term objectives will require work 
over generations – thirty years or more – the actions 
in this strategy will bring real results starting today. 
These projects are affordable, scalable, replicable and 
measurable. They will support our communities’ efforts 
to adapt to the accelerating changes we face, to survive 
no matter what shocks occur, and to confidently thrive, 
building a Melbourne that offers a higher quality of life 
to all of its citizens, now and for future generations.

We encourage you to read on and find out more about 
what all this means in practice, and share the strategy 
with your networks. We hope you enjoy this strategy, 
and we welcome your responses.

You can contact the Resilient Melbourne team at 
resilence@melbourne.vic.gov.au.

The mayors and CEOs of Melbourne’s 
metropolitan councils came together to discuss 
finalising the strategy. They were joined by the 
Resilient Melbourne Steering Committee at 
Melbourne Town Hall on 14 April, 2016.

INTRODUCTION

Urban resilience and 100 Resilient Cities

The world’s population is projected to reach 9.5 billion in 2050, with 75 per cent 
of these people living in cities.1 The Rockefeller Foundation pioneered the 100RC 
initiative in response to the trends of urbanisation, globalisation and climate change. 

As cities grow larger, the likely consequences of 
unexpected events are ever greater for individual 
cities. Cities are also more numerous and increasingly 
interdependent, meaning the effects of events in one 
place can be felt around the world. Meanwhile, climate 
change increases the likelihood of greater numbers 
of catastrophic events happening.2 

Already, Australia is one of the world’s most urbanised 
countries – almost 90 per cent of Australians live in 
urban areas, mainly on our eastern seaboard and we are 
vulnerable to a wide range of stresses and shocks.3

Definition of resilience 
100RC defines urban resilience as the capacity of individuals, institutions, businesses and systems within 
a city to adapt, survive and thrive no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.

CHRONIC STRESSES
Challenges that weaken the fabric of a city on a 
day-to-day or cyclical basis. Examples include sea 
level rise, increasing pressures on healthcare services, 
unemployment, and deeper social inequality.

ACUTE SHOCKS
Sudden events that threaten a city. In Melbourne, 
examples of acute shocks include heatwaves, bushfires, 
floods, influenza pandemics, and extremist acts, 
including cyber-crime.

INTRODUCTION

Why the Resilient Melbourne project?

Melbourne is a vibrant and proudly multicultural city of 4.3 million residents, 
originating from more than 180 different countries. A ‘city of cities’, Melbourne 
is made up of 32 local government authorities (councils) spread over 10,000 
square kilometres around Port Phillip Bay, comprising hundreds of diverse local 
neighbourhoods, each with its own character, cultural mix and set of advantages 
and problems.

Today, the scale and pace of demographic change in 
Melbourne are unprecedented. Projections suggest 
that by 2051 Melbourne will be home to approximately 
7.7 million people, and is likely to be Australia’s largest 
city.4 Globalisation continues to disrupt our economy 
and society, while climate change is increasing the 
risk of extreme events and undermining many of the 
assumptions used to plan and develop our city.

To cope with this increasing complexity and uncertainty, 
we need a new approach. This must be centred on 
our communities, supporting and enabling them to 
adapt to these accelerating changes and the associated 
stresses, to survive no matter what shocks occur, 
and to confidently thrive. This approach will link new 

resilience-building actions with existing efforts – this 
way we can build a Melbourne that is a better place for 
future generations to live in, and whose services and 
advantages can be enjoyed by all of its citizens.

Our three levels of government – local, state and 
Commonwealth – and hundreds of business and 
community organisations need to be part of this new 
approach, making resilience part of everything they do. 
To create the environment for communities to adapt, 
survive and thrive, we must innovate, be adaptable 
and flexible, collaborate across traditional boundaries 
and sectors, and act now, for the long term. Resilient 
Melbourne will be an important contributor to this 
process, turning uncertainty into opportunity.

How was this strategy developed?

Resilient Melbourne is a true collaboration – led by councils – across levels 
of government, business and community. It is based on engagement with over 
1000 stakeholders across Melbourne, Australia and the broader 100RC network.

The strategy has been developed in two phases. 
It was launched with an agenda setting workshop in 
April 2014. With this providing some valuable initial 
context, the work began in earnest towards the end of 
that year. This involved broad research and consultation 
to better understand strengths and vulnerabilities likely 
to affect Melbourne’s resilience. It included identifying 
our city’s critical physical and social infrastructure, along 
with the shocks and stresses that could threaten them 
in the future, described further below in Melbourne in 
context. Through a series of discussions and meetings we 
also sought to understand perceptions of Melbourne’s 
resilience, including initiatives and practices that are 
already contributing to the resilience of our city. 

Based on this information, in June 2015 we released 
Melbourne’s Preliminary Resilience Assessment, which 
was the first of its kind in Australia. The document 
was informed and supported by the mayors and chief 
executive officers (CEOs) of Melbourne’s metropolitan 
councils and proposed five discovery areas for deeper 
investigation by working groups.

The members of these working groups were subject 
matter experts, led by local government CEOs. Using 
desktop research, spatial mapping, surveys, interviews, 
and innovative design sessions attended by organisations 
from diverse sectors, the working groups further 
investigated the discovery areas, the opportunities 
and challenges associated with each. The research and 
engagement helped us shape our vision for a resilient 
Melbourne – a city that is viable, sustainable, liveable 
and prosperous, long into the future. Having undergone 

thorough examination, our five discovery areas 
evolved into the four long-term objectives described 
on pages 37-53. 

Drawing on local ideas and examples of excellence 
from around the world (notably from cities in the 
100RC network), our working groups identified more 
than 200 relevant opportunities to tackle resilience 
challenges and help achieve these objectives. We then 
tested and refined each opportunity using the principles 
of the 100RC City Resilience Framework, including the 
‘resilience lens’ and qualities of resilience (see opposite). 
This ensured that the actions in this strategy have 
resilience thinking at their core, and that they will bring 
the broadest possible benefits. To achieve these they are 
organised under four action areas described on page 55.

Melbourne’s Indigenous 
communities and colonial past

A resilient Melbourne recognises the value of the diversity and strength of 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. We want an inclusive community 
– one where Melbourne’s social and economic advantages can be fully enjoyed 
by the First Peoples of this land.

Traditional Aboriginal cultures and communities were 
severely and irrevocably harmed by the arrival of 
Europeans. The actions of explorers, whalers, sealers and 
settlers all took their toll on Aboriginal society. These 
repercussions are still felt today. Aboriginal Australians 
have strived to retain their culture and identity through 
the period of non-Indigenous settlement, for more than 
two centuries.

The land surrounding where the Birrarung (Yarra River) 
runs into the Nerm (Port Phillip Bay) is Kulin country. 
At the time of European settlement, the local Aboriginal 
population was estimated at somewhere between 
10,000 and 20,000 people. The place now known 
as Melbourne is one in which Aboriginal people have 
lived, cared for country, and maintained their distinctive 
culture, for at least 30,000 years.7 This longevity alone 
demonstrates the resilience of our First Peoples.

Although there are many stories and places in and 
around Melbourne that contain evidence of this 
connection to country, it is not always apparent to people 
who visit, live or work here. Nevertheless, Melbourne 
today is a significant gathering place for Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander people, and is regarded by many as 
the hub of Victorian Aboriginal communities.

MELBOURNE IN CONTEXT

In 1835, the fledgling community that would become 
Melbourne was called ‘Bearbrass’. There were 177 new 
settlers (142 male, 35 female), 13 buildings and some 
26,000 sheep.8 For the European arrivals, Melbourne 
was at the far edge of the known world. It was a harsh 
environment that would have demanded resilience – 
people needed to be resourceful and adaptable to live 
here. If crops failed, sickness struck, or fire destroyed 
property, the new settlers had no outside support to 
turn to.

The grid that surveyor Robert Hoddle laid out for the 
settlement in 1837 had unusually wide streets and 
abundant parklands, more suited to a large city than 
to the small town that existed at the time. Even as a 
‘remote and sleepy wool port’, this place possessed 
something that inspired visions of a grand future.9 
The first non-indigenous settlers survived then thrived, 
adapting to their new environment and laying the 
cultural, economic and physical foundations of the 
modern city that is Melbourne today.

Today, Melbourne is a liveable city

Melbourne is a stable and cohesive society, with many residents enjoying a high 
standard of living and quality of life, supported by ready access to education 
and healthcare. In Melbourne, a challenge for our resilience is maintaining these 
advantages and making them available to everybody.

Melbourne is known internationally for its excellence 
in urban design, creativity, culture and innovation. 
We have a sporting precinct at our heart, and 
throughout the city we enjoy cultural institutions 
such as art galleries, museums, libraries and theatres. 
Melbourne is recognised as a UNESCO City of 
Literature and as a UNESCO City of Learning 
(Melton), and is a major centre for street art, music 
and theatre.10 All of these strengths support and 
contribute to our rich and diverse culture.

These amenities and our culture create economic 
opportunities and have contributed to Melbourne being 
consistently ranked as one of the world’s most liveable 
cities for more than a decade.11 These rankings reflect our 
high levels of stability and security, access to healthcare, 
education and culture, advanced infrastructure and 
relatively clean environment.

However, these rankings do not consider factors such 
as housing affordability or account for inequality across 
Melbourne. While our city is liveable for those with easy 
access to essential services and a well-paying job, living 
in the world’s sixth-most expensive city presents major 
difficulties for many Melburnians, particularly in areas 
of entrenched disadvantage and those located furthest 
from the central business district.12 

Inequality in Melbourne has other causes too. 
For example, gender, race and disability still influence a 
person’s earning potential. The average weekly earnings 
of women in Victoria are 14 per cent lower than those of 
their male counterparts.

MELBOURNE IN CONTEXT

In 2013, average weekly disposable incomes of 
Melbourne’s Indigenous population were $135 less than 
the incomes of non-Indigenous Melburnians ($564 
versus $699).13 Alongside this, people with a disability 

are likely to have lower incomes, due to lower 
workforce participation, and are often forced to rely 
more on government allowances such as the Disability 
Support Pension.14

VULNERABILITY AND DISADVANTAGE IN MELBOURNE

Vulnerability Analysis of Mortgage, Petroleum and Inflation Risks and Expenditure 
(VAMPIRE) Index, 2011

Since the Second World War, Melbourne’s growth has 
radiated outwards from the central business district. 
A 2012 parliamentary inquiry into liveability in outer 
suburban Melbourne found that this, and the rapid rate 
of growth, ‘has placed significant pressure on existing 
infrastructure and created strong demand for new 
infrastructure’.15 Outer suburban communities have poorer 
access to employment, services and transport, and are at 
higher risk of becoming isolated and disconnected.16

are more vulnerable to fluctuations in factors such as 
petrol prices and interest rates.

Geographic disadvantage is entrenched in many 
communities. Despite a proliferation of social initiatives 
led by Commonwealth and state governments, many areas 
that were disadvantaged decades ago remain disadvantaged 
today.17 Melbourne’s councils, thanks to their strong links 
with their local communities, are well placed to tackle 
these inequities.

The map below shows the spread of disadvantage 
across Melbourne. High disadvantage is defined as 
low access to ‘material and social resources and ability 
to participate in society’, which include factors such 
as employment, English-speaking proficiency and 
household income.

Proudly multicultural and diverse

Melbourne’s diversity is a major strength, but to be truly resilient our society must 
also be cohesive, to avoid the stresses caused by disunity, and to be able to act as 
one when shocks do strike.

Across the Greater Melbourne area, nearly one-third of 
residents were born overseas, with the largest numbers 
coming from the United Kingdom (4.2 per cent), 
India (2.7 per cent), China (2.3 per cent), Italy (1.7 per 
cent) and New Zealand (1.7 per cent).18 There are also 
substantial Vietnamese, Sri Lankan and Malaysian-born 
communities, in addition to recent South African and 
Sudanese migrants. Across Melbourne, 33 per cent of 
people speak a language other than English at home.19 
Melbourne has the largest Greek-speaking population 
outside Europe – comparable to some larger cities in 
Greece – and the surname Nguyen is our second-most 
common surname, after Smith.20

MELBOURNE IN CONTEXT

Melbourne’s most multicultural municipalities are 
Greater Dandenong and Brimbank, where respectively 
64 per cent and 56 per cent of residents speak a 
language other than English at home.22 Unfortunately, 
these municipalities also rank first and third in Victoria 
on the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) 
measure of disadvantage, indicating that establishing a 
prosperous life in Melbourne can be difficult for many 
people arriving from overseas.23

Inclusion and integration are essential qualities of 
resilience, both for systems and people. Melbourne has 
a long history of inclusion and many see our acceptance 
of new arrivals as one of our greatest strengths. 
However, there have been problems, including racial 
intolerance, although at comparatively low levels 
compared to some other parts of the world.

Immigration from overseas is set to be the greatest 
contributor to Melbourne’s and Victoria’s population 
growth, with an average of 48,000 people estimated 
to arrive every year between 2006 and 2036.21 This 
movement of people brings new skills and greater 
cultural understanding, as well as connecting us more 
deeply to the rest of the world. It will be essential to 
our wellbeing as a society and our overall resilience that 
as our population grows and becomes more culturally 
diverse, we continue to welcome newcomers and the 
diversity they bring.

Globally and regionally connected

What happens around the world is felt in Melbourne, and what we do here can 
affect people’s lives far beyond our own city. We prosper thanks to our connections 
but when systems fail or events happen in places with which we trade and engage, 
our resilience may be threatened by those very linkages. 

Lloyds Risk Register has identified an international 
market collapse as the greatest threat to Melbourne’s 
insurable gross domestic product. Cyber-crime, 
which can originate anywhere in the world, was 
ranked second.24

Melbourne has been at the centre of numerous 
technological and scientific innovations that have 
improved lives across the world – the bionic ear, 
the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and 
the ‘black box’ flight recorder all had their origins 
in Melbourne, to name just a few. We have also 
developed world-leading approaches to tackling 
social and environmental issues, such as in emergency 
management and water-sensitive urban design.

We are active in global programs that support resilience 
building. In addition to 100RC, Melbourne participates 
in the C40 Network, which connects cities around 
the world on climate change-related challenges. 
The UN Global Cities Compact Programme is also 
managed from Melbourne and we host ICLEI (Local 
Governments for Sustainability) for the Oceania 
region. We look to use these networks to assist not just 
Melbourne but a broad range of other countries and 
their cities.

Melbourne is connected to global economic trends 
through trade, people and the flow of information. 
Our increasing links to Asia present significant 
opportunities, as a growing Asian middle class comes 
to Melbourne seeking high quality produce, education, 
healthcare and holiday destinations. But this level of 
global connectedness also brings some risks, by making 
Melbourne vulnerable to economic events and trends 
overseas, such as the recent slowing of growth in China. 

26

MELBOURNE IN CONTEXT

Metropolitan Melbourne is highly dependent on other 
parts of Victoria, as well as on other cities and states 
in Australia. For instance, 41 per cent of Melbourne’s 
fresh produce is currently grown within 100 kilometres 
of the city, but as urban development spreads outwards 
to accommodate population growth, the resulting loss of 
agricultural land could reduce this figure to 18 per cent 
by 2050.25 The current trend is towards greater reliance 
on produce from interstate and overseas, which exposes 
Melbourne to longer supply chains that are more 
vulnerable to shocks such as severe weather, extreme 
currency fluctuations and political unrest.

Melbourne is also heavily reliant on activities outside 
the metropolitan area for its energy supply.26 Existing 
energy sources, notably brown coal mined and burned 
in the La Trobe Valley to generate electricity, contribute 
directly to environmental stresses. The grid that this 
energy fuels is further vulnerable to shocks in the form 
of extreme events, whether natural or man-made.

Active in building resilience

We build our resilience in many ways, directly and indirectly, consciously and 
otherwise. Our future resilience will be determined by how well we unite and 
integrate efforts and investments.

The recently created Infrastructure Victoria is initiating 
a consultation process to begin developing a 30-year 
infrastructure strategy for Victoria (page 137 describes 
this aligned local action in more detail).

In addition to the international networks highlighted 
above, resilience-building in Melbourne is fundamentally 
influenced by policies at Commonwealth, state and local 
government levels, and across a number of ministerial 
portfolios and agencies. These policies are undergoing 
significant reform. Australia is shifting its focus on 
managing and responding to emergencies, to proactively 
building resilience, as shown by the 2011 National 
Strategy for Disaster Resilience.27 The importance 
of cities to Australia’s future was recognised by the 
appointment, in 2015, of a federal minister for cities and 
the built environment. 28 

At the state government level, Plan Melbourne, 
Melbourne’s metropolitan planning strategy, is currently 
being refreshed to incorporate responses to climate 
change, lack of affordable housing and infrastructure 
commitments.29 Plan Melbourne is part of a web of 
reviews and initiatives such as regional growth plans, 
precinct structure plan guidelines, open space and 
boulevard plans, and the Yarra River strategies. 

28

MELBOURNE IN CONTEXT

At the local government level, each of Melbourne’s 
32 councils has a range of strategies that, together, 
contribute to Melbourne’s overall resilience. Every 
council has a council plan, municipal health and wellbeing 
plan, municipal emergency management plan, and a 
planning scheme. Most councils also publish documents 
on specific issues, such as economic development 
strategies and climate change adaptation plans.

Melbourne’s multiplicity of councils enables each 
municipality to tailor its activities to suit its local 
community. Councils also regularly collaborate on 
important issues, often forming regional groupings 
(for example, the Inner Melbourne Action Plan and 
Lead West). But we may still be missing opportunities 
to implement more effective and efficient solutions 
available on different scales. Councils are at the front 
line in tackling problems – such as the effects of 
social exclusion and isolation – that cross municipal 
boundaries. The cooperative approach promoted 
by Resilient Melbourne can be a catalyst for better 
coordinating these efforts across multiple municipalities.

We need to coordinate and act better together 
because despite all of the attention to resilience-building 
by government, many businesses and community 
organisations, we continue to face significant chronic 
stresses and acute shocks, as described in the 
following pages. 

“ This is a rare and unique opportunity 
to think and act collectively.

Faced with chronic stresses

Despite our many efforts and relative wealth overall, as a city we face stresses that 
weaken the fabric of our society, further entrench disadvantage, and may trigger 
the shocks of the future. Chronic stresses act like ‘shock amplifiers’, increasing 
both their likelihood and the harm they cause.

A CHANGING ECONOMY AND 
HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT

In parallel with a growing population, our economy is 
moving away from its traditional manufacturing past. 
While Melbourne is still home to some of Australia’s 
significant manufacturers, our economy is becoming 
more knowledge and service-based, with strengths 
in finance, healthcare and education. For instance, 
among all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) countries, Australia in 2014 had 
the highest proportion of international students enrolled 
in its tertiary institutions.33 Melbourne is home to some 
of Australia’s largest universities, education services are 
a major industry and International students are now a 
significant part of Melbourne’s multicultural population. 

RAPID POPULATION GROWTH

Between 2006 and 2011, Growth Area councils on 
Melbourne’s fringe (Casey, Cardinia, Hume, Melton, 
Whittlesea and Wyndham) grew by 183,726 people 
– 50 per cent of metropolitan Melbourne’s total 
population growth.30 A mixture of high birth rates – 
80 babies are born each week to Wyndham families 
– and migration make Whittlesea and Wyndham 
Australia’s two fastest-growing municipalities, with 
Casey and Melton also in the top ten.31

Rapid population growth makes it more difficult to 
provide adequate infrastructure and services, and 
increases the pressure on the city’s outer regions in 
particular. The rate and scale of development is testing 
our natural environment and the benefits it provides, 
such as clean air, climate regulation, water filtration and 
recreational opportunities.

Although recent research undertaken for Resilient 
Melbourne, as well as annual surveys conducted by the 
Scanlon Foundation, show that Melbourne has relatively 
high levels of social cohesion,32 there is a concern that 
our current development is inadequately integrating 
new arrivals into established neighbourhoods and 
opportunities.

30

MELBOURNE IN CONTEXT

The shift away from manufacturing has resulted in 
higher unemployment, particularly in the south east 
(7.7 per cent) and northwest (8.1 per cent) of the 
city.34 Further advances in digital technology and 
automation are expected to cause the loss of even 
more manufacturing jobs in coming years – analysis by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) indicates that 39 per 
cent of Melbourne’s workers are currently in jobs at risk 
of disappearing.35

Additionally, income disparity in Australia grew 
consistently between 1995 and 2012.36 This corresponds 
with rising median house prices across Melbourne, 
less access to the property market, as well as increasing 
homelessness, as shown to the right.

PRESSURES ON OUR QUALITY OF LIFE 
AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

The stresses caused by economic inequality and 
geographic disadvantage can lead to other stresses, such 
as increased traffic congestion and longer commuting 
times. Along with factors such as employment 
vulnerability, these stresses correlate with higher 
frequency of alcoholism and a 62 per cent increase in 
reported family violence incidents since 2010-11.40 This 
reflects an interdependency of problems that we must 
tackle if we are to reduce the serious consequences of 
these stresses.

Additionally, Melbourne’s population is ageing, and 
we are seeing increasing rates of preventable illnesses. 
If current trends continue, it is estimated that more 
than 30 per cent of 5–19 year olds will be overweight 
or obese by 2025, as well as 83 per cent of males 
and 75 per cent of females aged 20 years and over.41 
These trends place significant strains on our healthcare 
system. For the period from 2002–03 to 2032–33, 
annual health expenditure for diabetes across Australia is 
expected to increase by 401 per cent, from $1.4 billion 
to $7 billion, largely owing to higher rates of obesity.42 
Increasing rates of mental illness will also contribute 
– in Victoria, the current economic cost of mental 
illness has been estimated at $5.4 billion per year, of 
which half ($2.7 billion) represents lost productivity 
and workforce participation.43

Vulnerable to acute shocks

Melbourne is exposed to natural disasters such as extreme heat, bushfires and 
floods, and emerging shocks like disease pandemics and extremist acts. As our city 
grows and is also affected by climate change, we need to be prepared for multiple 
shocks to occur at once.

NATURAL DISASTERS

The cost of natural disasters in Victoria is significant. 
Damage caused by floods in the Port Phillip and 
Westernport catchments alone is estimated at 
approximately $400 million per year, while the total 
cost of natural disasters between 2003 and 2013 has 
been valued as high as $19.9 billion.44

MELBOURNE IN CONTEXT

The National Strategy for Disaster Resilience notes 
that most disasters – although seeming to be sudden 
or unexpected events – begin slowly, because they 
usually arise from environmental conditions that 
create vulnerability to a triggering event. For example, 
between 1995 and 2009 Melbourne experienced a 
severe drought that significantly reduced reserves of 
potable water, as well as creating low soil-moisture levels 
and extremely dry vegetation.45 The chronic stress 
of drought placed extreme pressure on agricultural 
industries and created ideal conditions for bushfires.

Then, in 2009 several devastating shocks occurred 
concurrently: the Black Saturday bushfires killed 173 
people, destroyed thousands of homes, and disrupted 
power supplies to nearly 500,000 people, while the 
accompanying heatwave was linked with 374 more 
deaths due to heat-related illness.46 In late 2010 
and early 2011, heavy rain from the west brought 
some of the worst floods ever seen in this part of the 
world.47 Climate change, population growth and urban 
development will make these kinds of events more 
frequent, more severe, and will affect more people.

Melbourne also experiences the indirect effects of 
natural disasters elsewhere in our region – for example, 
floods in agricultural areas can inflate food prices, and 
fire crews based in Melbourne’s east are regularly called 
on to tackle bushfires in rural areas.

Not only do shock events harm those most vulnerable, 
they can also create their own stress consequences. The 
Australian Business Roundtable for Disaster Resilience 
and Safer Communities notes that the social costs of 
natural disasters ‘tend to persist over a person’s lifetime, 
while most tangible costs are one-off’.48 Following shock 
events, we find notably increased rates of mental illness, 
family violence and suicide, often some years after 
families or communities appear to have recovered 
from the event. 

HUMAN-DRIVEN SHOCKS

Pandemic influenza is Victoria’s third-highest priority 
emergency risk.49 Aside from the obvious health 
ramifications, pandemics have the potential to cripple 
Melbourne’s economy, particularly given the high 
concentration of employment in inner Melbourne 
municipalities. For instance, the 2009 outbreak of 
H1N1 (Swine Flu) was estimated to have reduced 
Australia’s gross domestic product by as much as 1.3 per 
cent, due to workplace absenteeism and lower business 
investment, even though fewer than 1,000 cases of the 
illness were reported across Australia.50

Transport infrastructure emergencies are also a major 
risk for Melbourne.51 The full closure of the CityLink, 
Burnley and Domain tunnels in October 2012 due 
to a technical failure showed how such incidents can 
cascade through our city systems, testing the extent 
of redundancy, i.e. additional capacity to cope with 
unexpected circumstances, in our transport network, 
and leading to widespread congestion across all major 
modes of transport (road, rail, tram, bus). Our rapid 
population growth, increasing demand for transport, 
ageing infrastructure and greater incidence of extreme 
weather events will all contribute to these risks.

Over the coming years we will also face new types of 
shocks caused by humans. For instance, Lloyd’s City 
Risk Index ranks cyber-crime as Melbourne’s second-
greatest threat to insurable gross domestic product 
($3.87 billion), ahead of floods and disease pandemics.52

MELBOURNE’S
RESILIENCE
OBJECTIVES

Resilient Melbourne has identified four long-term (30 years or more) resilience 
objectives. For each of these, local government can take a leading role, in 
partnership with other sectors. Even more importantly, we agreed to concentrate 
on tackling our chronic stresses and developing actions that will make Melbourne 
stronger and more resilient whatever shocks we may face, rather than focusing 
on particular shock events.

37

38

Our long-term objectives

All Resilient Melbourne objectives are interdependent. 
To be truly resilient our people must support each other 
and must have places that encourage this support. 
This requires a strong economy, so we can invest in 
infrastructure and services across our entire city and to 
give all our citizens opportunities to generate income. 
And all of this will be affected – for better or worse 
– by the state of our natural environment.

four resilience objectives, and Resilient Melbourne more

Stronger together

Empower communities to take active responsibility for their own and each other’s 
wellbeing, safety and health.

WHY IS THIS OBJECTIVE IMPORTANT?
Melburnians, like most Australians, generally see 
themselves as resourceful and resilient in the face of 
shocks. However, research undertaken by Resilient 
Melbourne found that only 41 per cent of Melburnians 
are confident that their neighbourhood would pull 
together in an emergency, and only 39 per cent 
believe that most people in their neighbourhood 
can be trusted.53 

This suggests that we are not as cohesive as we imagine. 
Such perceptions place increased pressure on our 
emergency services by reducing community self-
reliance. With a less certain future and more extreme 
events likely, equipping our citizens to be more self-
reliant and mutually supportive is likely to be crucial for 
their and the city’s resilience.

In the past, Australia focused its efforts almost 
exclusively on responding to the after-effects of 
disasters, rather than on preventing or mitigating 
disasters before they happen. A recent report by the 
Australian Government Productivity Commission found 
that 97 per cent of disaster funding is spent on response 
activities, while the Australian Business Roundtable for 
Disaster Resilient and Safer Communities suggests that 
investing in disaster preparedness and resilience-building 
could reduce government disaster response budgets by 
50 per cent.54

“ The emphasis needs to be on ‘with’ 
the community. Community is at 
the heart of resilience. Sure there 
is emergency management, urban 
planning and other aspects, but 
building community resilience and 
working with community is core.” 
Frank Archer, 
Director, 
Monash University Disaster Resilience Initiative

MELBOURNE’S RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES

In contributing to this objective, we will support 
actions that:
•  help us understand what motivates communities 
and individuals to be more proactive about each 
other’s wellbeing

Understanding the drivers of community 
resilience on page 94.

•  develop new ways of operating that empower 
communities to be more active in their safety 
and wellbeing

An emergency management community resilience 
framework for Victoria on page 90.

•  build new community networks, and 

strengthen existing ones

The Neighbourhood Project on page 74.

•  help people at risk of exclusion form 

strong social bonds

Multicultural water safety and settlement 
on page 98.
Young and Resilient living labs on page 126.

•  make insurance affordable for more people

Innovative insurance on page 104.

We are fortunate to have governments that are 
able to respond to disaster events. However, this is 
contributing to a common perception that our safety 
and preparedness are someone else’s responsibility, 
and that governments can always be relied upon to 
come to the aid of those who do not plan ahead. We 
need our communities to be better able to recognise 
the hazards they face, to plan to manage risks and 
their consequences for themselves and their broader 
communities, supported by certainty that governments 
will always help the most vulnerable and those who are 
simply unfortunate.

This phenomenon of under-preparedness is 
demonstrated by widespread under-insurance among 
Australians. Research by the Insurance Council of 
Australia found that 81 per cent of homeowners and 
renters do not have sufficient insurance cover to resume 
the same standard of living following a crisis; this is also 
true of many small to medium business enterprises.55

Melbourne’s Preliminary Resilience Assessment identified 
greater self-reliance and personal responsibility as 
important factors in easing pressure on our healthcare 
system.56 While all levels of government have 
responsibilities to create and maintain conditions that 
give people control over their lives, at present, many 
community, market and government structures do not 
encourage this. All too frequently we deliver services 
in ways that lead to dependence, rather than fostering 
capacity and empowering our citizens.

In keeping with the approach of the Victorian 
Government, and of many councils, Resilient 
Melbourne acknowledges that social factors such as 
education, income and access to open spaces are crucial 
to a person’s capacity to lead a healthy lifestyle.

Our shared places

Create and sustain buildings, infrastructure and activities that promote social 
cohesion, equality of opportunity and health

WHY IS THIS OBJECTIVE IMPORTANT?
The OECD defines a socially cohesive society as one 
that ‘works towards the wellbeing of all its members, 
fights exclusion and marginalisation, creates a sense of 
belonging, promotes trust and offers its members the 
opportunity of upward mobility’.57 Members of socially 
cohesive communities are better equipped to support 
one another through good times and bad.

Melbourne’s physical form plays a major role in the 
cohesiveness of its communities. Affordable and suitable 
housing – a United Nations-recognised basic human 
right – efficient transport networks, and community 
infrastructure (including healthcare, educational 
facilities and recreational spaces) are all essential for 
building and maintaining social cohesion.

Providing infrastructure to support cohesive 
communities is a challenge for all of Melbourne, not 
only in its most disadvantaged areas, as highlighted 
on pages 22-23.

For instance, Southbank in the central business district 
is now home to more than 11,000 residents, most living 
in high-rise buildings, but the postcode has no school, 
bank or post office.58 While Southbank benefits from its 
close proximity to the amenities of the central business 
district and South Melbourne, in some cases this kind 
of development can result in socially isolated residents, 
who have inadequate support networks to improve their 
everyday quality of life, or to turn to in times of need.

While providing adequate and equitable access to 
infrastructure is a major goal for Melbourne’s resilience, 
we must also think about the activities and behaviours 
that lead to cohesive, fair and healthy communities 
– and how we can promote them. In 2010, the Grattan 
Institute examined the decision-making arrangements 
of successful cities. It concluded that ‘high and sustained 
levels of public engagement in decision-making’ 
and collaboration across different sectors of society 
are crucial. 59 

Cohesive communities are also better able to share 
resources and support each other in response to shocks 
and stresses. Following extreme events, cohesive 
communities make the means to survive and thrive 
– particularly capital and skills – available more quickly 
and to more people.

MELBOURNE’S RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES

“ On the one hand, we need to make 
resilience easy – something people 
can be proud of and do as part of 
day-to-day life. On the other, we also 
need to have hard conversations with 
community about planning. It’s a long 
game – a 40 to 50 year game.”

LEARNING FROM OTHERS – SOCIAL COHESION IN CHICAGO’S HEATWAVE60 
When a heatwave struck Chicago in 1995, two 
neighbourhoods – Auburn Gresham and Englewood 
– had almost identical demographic profiles. 
While both communities were exposed to similar 
heat, a built environment that fostered community 
connections meant that Auburn Gresham residents 
were more likely to check on each other, particularly 
on vulnerable and elderly people. Englewood, on the 
other hand, was experiencing a prolonged period of 
economic and physical decline, as well as lower levels 
of social cohesion.

The death rates from the heat wave were 
dramatically different: Englewood suffered 33 deaths 
per 100,000 people, while Auburn Gresham had 
just 3 deaths per 100,000. This shows how strong, 
connected communities can reduce harm caused 
by the shock events that will inevitably affect 
cities. This is a particularly instructive example for 
Melburnians as we face a future with more frequent 
and intense extreme heat events as a result of 
climate change.

Collingwood to St Kilda.

ALIGNED LOCAL ACTION
Resilient Melbourne will work with the CSIRO 
(Australia’s national science agency) to conduct 
an initial assessment of a range of metropolitan 
systems and their exposure to heat stress. The 
assessment will include local transport networks, 
healthcare systems, energy and water utilities, 
and other local support networks, including 
interdependencies between them. It will provide 
a scientific basis for councils to understand risk, 
and will assist inform recommendations to reduce 
vulnerability and support integrated planning and 
decision-making.

ABOUT THIS PROJECT’S 100RC 
PLATFORM PARTNER 

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
Organisation (CSIRO) is Australia’s national science 
agency. CSIRO research initiatives use science to solve 
real issues that make a difference to people, industry 
and the planet.

Through CSIRO’s ‘City Engines’ web-based tool, 
cities can integrate climate adaptation and disaster risk 
reduction into action plans for more resilient cities. 
Through risk management, it aims to guide city partners 
to identify options that reduce the impact of climate 
change and variability.

MELBOURNE’S RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES

45

A dynamic economy

Provide diverse local employment opportunities that support an adaptable 
workforce that is ready for the jobs of the future.

WHY IS THIS OBJECTIVE IMPORTANT?
Providing employment opportunities is critical to 
increasing the resilience of our city as a whole, as 
well as that of particular communities and individuals. 
Employment creates bonds based on common interests, 
and widens support networks. It enables us to buy 
services such as insurance, and provides income we 
can use to recover from shock events. Opportunities 
for diverse and fulfilling employment also help reduce 
a range of chronic stresses, such as homelessness, 
poverty, mental illness and domestic violence.

As described on page 30, Melbourne’s economy is 
moving away from a heavy manufacturing past, towards 
higher-skilled jobs. For this reason, we need a workforce 
equipped to work in emerging industries, some of which 
may not yet even exist. Governments are increasingly 
aware that businesses competing in a global economy 
need more employees proficient in science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics (STEM). Although 75 
per cent of Australia’s fastest-growing occupations now 
require these skills, the number of STEM university 
graduates is not increasing, the number of graduating 
high school students (Year 12) studying STEM subjects 
is declining, and businesses are struggling to find 
STEM-skilled employees.61

MELBOURNE’S RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES

More generally, schools that are accessible to local 
communities are fundamental infrastructure to support 
this objective. Melbourne’s rapid growth in particular 
locations, such as inner city and fringe areas, needs to 
be complemented with new schools. 

The PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, 
A Smart Move, predicted that shifting 1 per cent 
of Australia’s workforce into science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics roles would add 
$57.4 billion to gross domestic product (net 
present value over 20 years).62

Although Melbourne has an extensive heavy rail 
system and the world’s largest tram network by track 
length, where a person lives significantly influences 
their access to jobs.63 Today, fewer than 10 per cent of 
employees in outer-ring municipalities work within 10 
kilometres of home. This has contributed to a stretching 
of the peak commuting periods, making it harder to 
avoid traffic congestion when travelling to and from 
work.64 Studies have linked lengthy commutes to ill 
health, including higher stress levels and lack of sleep.65 
Resilient Melbourne recognises that these trends pose 
a risk to Melbourne’s future resilience and encourages 
actions that will improve economic activities across our 
metropolitan area.

A healthier environment

Enable strong natural assets and ecosystems alongside a growing population.

WHY IS THIS OBJECTIVE IMPORTANT?
Although our unique natural environment poses threats 
such as bushfires and floods, we also directly rely on it 
for our livelihoods and wellbeing. Melbourne’s parks, 
forests, gardens and wetlands help clean the air we 
breathe, reduce noise, regulate the climate, filter water, 
and give us places for recreation, to name just a few. 
The Plan Melbourne Refresh Discussion Paper recognises 
that our non-urban areas provide important amenity 
and have inherent natural value, as well as supporting 
industries such as tourism, food production and 
horticulture. It states clearly that these areas should not 
be considered ‘vacant land awaiting urban development’. 
These are just some of the reasons why people are 
increasingly valuing the economic benefits of our 
natural environment, in addition to its inherent value. 

Despite such awareness, our natural assets are coming 
under increasing pressure as more development is 
needed to support our growing population. Rezoning 
and infill development are increasing population 
densities in inner and middle Melbourne, while new 
residential and industrial developments in outer areas 
often require clearing of remnant grassland, woodland or 
arable land. These trends are contributing to problems 
such as higher urban temperatures, increased runoff, 
and greater pressure on drainage infrastructure. 

Melbourne faces these problems in the context of 
increasing pressures from climate change (p. 53). 
Research by Monash University has shown that 
maximum temperatures of 29 degrees Celsius and 
above increase the rate of heat-related illness and death 
in people over 64 years of age.68 Melbourne is a coastal

the same time more and more people are competing for 
access to this coastal land. 69

MELBOURNE’S RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES

Protecting our natural assets saves money in the long 
run. Once a natural asset is lost, it is expensive, and in 
many cases impossible, to recreate or recover it. Such 
losses increase our reliance on hard infrastructure – for 
example, expensive sea walls to protect us against storm 
surges once natural systems such as mangroves are lost.

In contributing to this objective, we will support 
actions that:
•  extend and link existing efforts to strengthen our 

natural assets and the ecosystem services they provide

Metropolitan urban forest strategy on page 62.

•  promote new and cost-effective ways to manage 
our natural resources more efficiently and reduce 
environmental damage

Integrated water management framework 
on page 68.

•  explore imaginative ways to put nature back 

into communities

The Neighbourhood Project on page 74.

THE 100RC GLOBAL 
NETWORK IN ACTION
In an effort to strengthen their natural assets, 
several 100RC cities, including Melbourne 
and Durban, are sharing their experiences and 
innovative approaches to understanding the links 
between climate change, water and biodiversity, 
and better ways both to protect biodiversity and to 
use nature to provide hard infrastructure services 
such as flood defences.

Vulnerability to heatwaves

This map shows vulnerability of residents to extreme heat events. Vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity 
of the exposed population, and capacity to adapt.

Urban green spaces play a key role in cooling our city and reducing exposure to heatwaves. Although parts of 
Melbourne have extensive green spaces, some Melbourne municipalities have among the lowest rates of tree canopy 
cover in Australia.

Four action areas: adapt, survive, thrive, embed

This section introduces the first set of actions that will help achieve our vision 
for a resilient Melbourne. They are a starting point for exploring new ways of 
working that will build our resilience for decades to come. The actions will 
achieve long-term benefits in ways that can be implemented now.

All actions are relevant to, but not necessarily owned 
by, local government. In investigating actions that will 
help achieve our vision, four clear action areas emerged. 
These action areas keep our communities at the centre 
of everything we are seeking to achieve, describing the 
different ways we will meet our objectives, building

Melbourne’s resilience against all potential shocks 
and stresses. They require an interdisciplinary focus, 
delivering multiple benefits and breaking out of 
narrower, more traditional structures such as ‘society, 
economy and environment’.

TODAY, TOMORROW AND TOGETHER, WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO:

ADAPT

Reduce our exposure 

to future shocks 

and stresses

SURVIVE

Withstand disruptions 
and bounce back better 

than before

THRIVE
Signiﬁcantly 

improve people’s 
quality of life

EMBED

Build resilience thinking

Building on existing structures and efforts

Melbourne is home to many passionate individuals and 
innovative organisations already helping communities 
to adapt, survive and thrive in the face of shocks and 
stresses. This strategy builds on their efforts by bringing 
successful actions and practices to a wider audience, as 
well as linking together those who may be taking similar 
approaches in isolation from one another.

The actions in this strategy are all directly supported 
by Resilient Melbourne. While implementation of some 
actions will be led by the Resilient Melbourne Delivery 

Office, most will be led by partners across community, 
academic and business sectors, as well as local and state 
government agencies.

By working together on these actions, partners will 
improve Melbourne’s collective resilience and will learn 
by doing; delivering tangible benefits for Melbourne’s 
communities while simultaneously generating new 
knowledge on how best to build resilience.

ACTIONS FOR A RESILIENT MELBOURNE

57

Implementing the actions

Resilient Melbourne must contribute to Melbourne’s 
resilience quickly and tangibly. For each action 
described in this section, we have identified action leads, 
partners and initial funding sources. Selected projects 
will also receive significant support from one or more 
100RC Platform Partners. These partners are leading 
service providers that offer in-kind support to members 
of the 100RC network.

We are currently creating implementation plans – 
monitoring and evaluation will be built into each action 
from the start. Each plan will include preliminary 
indicators for measuring results, which will be reviewed 
before starting.

The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will oversee 
the implementation of this first Resilient Melbourne 
strategy. This approach is supported by the 32 councils 
of Melbourne, led by the City of Melbourne, Emergency 
Management Victoria (EMV), the Municipal Association 
of Victoria (MAV), the Department of Environment, 
Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), and the 
Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPC).

We have identified three flagship actions. These 
have the potential to move us significantly towards 
achieving our vision of a more resilient Melbourne: 
viable, sustainable, liveable and prosperous, today 
and for the long term.

Our three flagship actions are a metropolitan 
urban forest strategy (p. 62), emergency 
management community resilience approach 
for Victoria (p. 90) and metropolitan cycling 
network (p. 112).

ACTIONS FOR A RESILIENT MELBOURNE

59

ADAPT

A resilient and adaptive Melbourne will look for ways to reduce our exposure 
to shocks and stresses that are an increasing part of everyday life.

In an adaptive Melbourne, our institutions must be 
flexible and responsive to emerging information, 
regularly adjusting the way they deliver services as the 
pace of social, environmental and economic change in 
our city continues to accelerate. The needs of the 
future – such as housing for a growing and ageing 
population, making better use of nature’s resources, 
and developing new skills – will not be met by sticking 
to old approaches.

Individuals and communities must also be adaptable 
in the face of rapid change. By providing access to 
education, information and knowledge, an adaptive 
Melbourne will give citizens the resources they need 
to become more resilient.

National Climate Resilience 
and Adaptation Strategy

In December 2015, the Australian Government 
released a National Climate Resilience and 
Adaptation Strategy,70 which sets out how 
Australia is managing climate risks. It mentions 
Resilient Melbourne as a key project currently 
under way and notes that resilience-building can 
mean many things, such as limiting or removing 
human-caused pressures on natural systems (like 
land clearing or pollution), or giving vulnerable 
communities reliable access to information and 
communit

Metropolitan urban forest strategy

Extend and link existing urban greening, reforestation and nature initiatives 
across Melbourne, to improve wellbeing and reduce our exposure to hazards 
such as heatwaves and flooding.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Melbourne’s liveability relies on a healthy natural 
environment for basic human needs such as clean 
air, fresh drinking water and a comfortable climate. 
However, the way our city is growing is putting 
these at risk.

Some of Melbourne’s local government areas already 
have among the lowest urban tree canopy ratios in 
Australia.71 Rezoning and infill development are resulting 
in less green space and higher population densities in 
inner and middle Melbourne. On Melbourne’s fringes, 
new suburbs are being built on arable land and areas 
of remnant native vegetation. Where rain once soaked 
easily into permeable soils, reducing peak stream flows 
and the risk of flash floods, hard surfaces like roofs 
and roads now dominate. These same hard surfaces, 
unshaded by vegetation, also absorb the sun’s heat – 
peak inner metropolitan temperatures are 7 degrees 
Celsius higher than those in surrounding rural areas.72 

This is all occurring in the context of climate change, 
which will cause more frequent heatwaves, droughts 
and extreme rainfall. While the effects of these 
phenomena will be widespread, they disproportionately 
affect already vulnerable members of our communities, 
including older residents, people who are unwell, and 
those who are financially disadvantaged.73

THE 100RC GLOBAL 
NETWORK IN ACTION
In the 100RC network, the city of Boulder, 
Colorado, in the USA is also pursuing the benefits 
of city-wide greening. As part of this action, 
the Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will 
collaborate with Boulder and its Chief Resilience 
Officer to share approaches and information.

THE ACTION
Across Melbourne, urban greening and revegetation 
projects are being undertaken by local councils, 
water authorities, community groups, and regional 
collaborations such as Greening the West. Victorian 
Government agencies such as DELWP and Parks 
Victoria also play key roles in this area.

This action will result in a metropolitan urban forest 
strategy for all of Melbourne. This strategy will enable 
all those currently involved, and others wanting to 
deliver urban greening projects in future, to understand 
how their efforts can best contribute to improving 
ecosystem health and services such as urban cooling and 
flood mitigation. It will achieve this by:
•  highlighting how and where existing initiatives 

can be expanded 

•  enabling the sharing of resources and knowledge by 

linking together currently disparate efforts

•  providing councils better information about their 

existing tree canopy cover, making resources available 
for public and private entities

•  providing opportunities for utility providers and 
infrastructure owners to address implementation 
barriers and help make Melbourne greener and cooler.

64

ADAPT

Metropolitan urban forest strategy

These also bring further benefits to communities. 
For example, research has repeatedly shown that 
greener cities have lower levels of obesity and other 
chronic illnesses, higher levels of physical activity, 
and improved mental health.74 

This action will link with and be supported by the 
Integrated Water Management action, described next. 

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
The metropolitan urban forest strategy will bring 
city-wide benefits that cannot be achieved by 
individual councils, suburbs, infrastructure operators or 
neighbourhoods in isolation. Greening on a metropolitan 
scale could truly transform our city. In addition to a 
range of amenity and biodiversity benefits, from a 
resilience perspective, a greener Melbourne means:
•   shadier, cooler metropolitan areas
•  lower flood risk for people and assets
•   less stormwater and nutrients entering waterways 

and Port Phillip Bay.

A metropolitan urban forest strategy 
would support a range of flora, fauna 
and recreational opportunities.

Integrated water management framework

Enable better use of existing water resources, and reduce our exposure to drought 
and flood, by developing decision-support tools that encourage water-sensitive 
urban design and integrated water management.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Climate change will exacerbate flooding in our urban 
areas, while lower annual rainfall and fewer days of 
rain will place further stress on our urban vegetation. 
Building yet more traditional storm drains and pipes 
is expensive and disruptive, while continuing to water 
trees and areas of vegetation during droughts is itself 
resource intensive, with regards water and labour, as well 
as financially.75 

Experience in places such as the Netherlands 
suggests that there are better ways to live with and 
harness water than through heavy engineering alone.76 
New, integrated solutions will reduce the risks to safety 
and financial security of thousands of Melburnians in 
flood-prone areas, while smarter ways of retaining water 
in our urban landscape will support existing and future 
vegetation during times of drought.

THE ACTION
This action will develop guidance and decision-making 
tools to better enable councils to expand the use of 
water-sensitive urban design and integrated water 
management techniques that are suited to their local 
contexts. These will build upon approaches already 
being applied in many parts of Melbourne, and work in 
conjunction with water authorities, other infrastructure 
operators and DELWP, which is currently developing 
a new water plan for Victoria. 

Additionally the action will develop a common language 
and framework across different levels of government, 
enabling more coordinated approaches to managing 
water in different regions and sub-catchment areas.

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
This action will improve councils’ understanding of 
water-sensitive urban design and integrated water 
management techniques, helping them to:
•  use these approaches in their stormwater 

management plans, thus reducing flood risk, 
improving water security and leading to cooler and 
greener urban areas

•  conserve potable water, allowing additional urban 
greening and bringing associated health benefits 
to local communities

•  bring together disparate sets of data (normally 

collected for single purposes) to enable better analysis

•  involve community groups from the first stages of 

planning water management projects, allowing them 
more of a say in the physical form of their community 
and the use of water resources

•  make public the costs and benefits of managing water 

– both to the community and government.

Association of Bayside Municipalities adaptation planning

Port Phillip Bay is an important recreational, 
economic and environmental asset, not only to 
Melbourne but to all of Australia. Melbourne’s 
development has placed the bay under stress, and 
bayside municipalities will face an increasing number 
of shock events originating in the bay, such as coastal 
storm surges and flooding from sea-level rise.

Many of the actions required to protect Port Phillip 
Bay rely on a coordinated effort across councils 
and all levels of government. But not all areas of 
Melbourne fully understand how activities that occur 
upstream affect the health of the bay, or the threats 
posed by climate change.

In response, Victoria’s 10 bayside councils formed 
the Association of Bayside Municipalities (ABM)
to coordinate their efforts. They have begun work 

on a regional coastal adaptation framework that will 
protect Port Phillip Bay’s value for tomorrow. To 
date, a document describing the present situation 
has been prepared. A discussion paper will then 
provide a basis for consulting bayside councils and 
other parties. An exploration of adaptation options 
will include a high-level risk screening of potential 
hazards and impacts.

The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will look 
to work with the ABM and its project partners to 
support the implementation of identified resilience-
building actions, including addressing the impacts of 
upstream regions on the health of the Bay.

The Neighbourhood Project

Through training and building capacity, this initiative will help community groups 
transform under-used land around Melbourne into a network of new public spaces.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Many Melburnians lack easy access to basic community 
infrastructure, such as parks and playgrounds. This 
diminishes people’s health and wellbeing and reduces 
social cohesion. With a growing population and 
constrained natural and financial resources, we need to 
provide the community infrastructure that fosters social 
cohesion, equal opportunity and liveability.

Despite pressures on available space, up to 30 per 
cent of land in Australian cities remains vacant or 
under-used.77 While such spaces have the potential 
collectively to comprise a large network of community 
spaces, council processes and limited resources can 
deter people from harnessing them for community 
benefit and use.

The Neighbourhood Project will also tackle barriers that 
impede community-led place-making projects, such as 
planning scheme requirements. It will work with councils 
to better understand and remove these barriers, while 
still ensuring that councils can fulfil their legal and public 
safety obligations.

The action will transform 24 under-used spaces in 
8 neighbourhoods into useful community public spaces, 
using a ‘tactical urbanism’ methodology.

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
•  A more active citizenry and stronger social networks 
will make community groups better able to carry out

New apartments trial for 
public housing residents

The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office will support efforts to replicate 
a new development that puts home ownership within reach of more public 
housing tenants.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Victoria’s 65,000 social and community dwellings 
(‘public housing’) are lifelines for some of Melbourne’s 
most vulnerable people. However, there is a serious 
shortage of supply – at present the waiting time for 
public housing is approximately 11 years, and with little 
new stock being developed, this is unlikely to shorten.78 

Nationally, the deficit of affordable housing for low- to 
middle-income households was estimated at 211,000 
dwellings in 2011, up from 138,000 in 2006.79 
Assuming historic demographic and supply trends 
continue, this gap will increase to nearly 370,000 
dwellings by the end of 2016, and 663,000 by 2031.

There are many success stories in Melbourne’s social 
and community housing sector – individuals and families 
who have improved their economic circumstances to 
the point where home ownership is within reach. 
However, with much of Melbourne’s social and 
community housing stock located in inner city areas 
with high property values, it is extremely difficult for 
residents to afford suitably sized accommodation in 
a similar area, close to their existing social networks 
and employment. This can result in these individuals 
remaining in social housing indefinitely, or buying homes 
in more affordable outer suburban areas, where they 
have no community connections.

THE ACTION
The Melbourne Apartments Project (MAP) will 
put home ownership within reach of more public 
housing tenants and provide a funding stream for the 
development of further similar projects. A pilot project 
is already under way at one site in inner Melbourne, 
where new two- and three-bedroom apartments are 
being offered solely to social housing tenants who 
meet specific eligibility criteria. Having assessed 
this approach, we believe it could be replicated in a 
number of areas around Melbourne, and the Resilient 
Melbourne Delivery Office is working with partners to 
identify sites and funding for further developments.

This action will enable participating councils to invest in renewable energy, thus

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Melbourne is heavily reliant on electricity generated 
in the Latrobe Valley, which leaves us vulnerable to 
energy disruptions from shock events such as bushfires, 
blackouts during heatwaves and acts of sabotage.80 
Diversifying the sources of electricity supplying 
Melbourne’s grid, while increasing renewable generation, 
can help reduce this reliance, and will bring health 
benefits from less burning of coal.

Additionally, we must tackle the chronic stresses of 
climate change and the more frequent and intense 
shock events it is causing. For this reason reducing our 
greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the proportion 
of renewable power in our energy mix is a resilience 
issue. Councils wish to take action, but individual 
councils are often too small to make cost-effective 
purchases or to negotiate effectively.

Working with Melbourne’s tertiary and further education colleges and 
upper secondary schools to support STEM education

Australia’s former Chief Scientist, Professor 
Ian Chubb, has stated that 75 per cent of the 
fastest-growing occupations now require STEM skills 
and knowledge, yet Australia lags behind many other 
developed countries in school-level maths and science 
skills.81 In response to these trends, the Victorian 
Government and other groups across Melbourne 
are encouraging increased STEM education.

Local government connects closely with citizens, yet 
has traditionally had little role in education provision. 
As part of Resilient Melbourne, local government 
is exploring opportunities to build on local strong 
connections with TAFEs and upper secondary 
schools to extend the work led by NCAT into other 
tertiary and further education colleges and upper 
secondary schools across metropolitan Melbourne.

 An innovative approach led by the Northern College 
of the Arts and Technology (NCAT) has been 
successful in providing students aged between 14 and 
18 with industry experience and an associate degree 
qualification, while supporting and inspiring them to 
equip themselves for the jobs of the future.

SURVIVE

A resilient Melbourne must be equipped to withstand 
disruptions, and bounce back from them better than before.

An adaptive Melbourne seeks to avoid and minimise 
the effects of disruptions. But there will be some 
shocks that we cannot prevent. Our communities and 
systems must be able to deal with these, collectively 
and as individuals.

LEARNING FROM OTHERS – WELLINGTON REGION 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICE (WREMO)
The city of Wellington, capital of New Zealand, 
is a member of the 100RC network. It is made 
up of nine councils. As in Melbourne, this brings 
some difficulties when coordinating emergency 
management and disaster risk management activities 
between multiple organisations.

Initiatives such as Tsunami Blue Lines, Community 
Response and Resilience Planning, Community 
Emergency Preparedness Training, and irreverent 
use of social media, have helped make the 
community more connected, and improved the 
region’s capacity to manage disaster risks.

WREMO was founded in 2012 as a semi-
autonomous organisation to coordinate disaster 
risk management across Wellington’s nine councils. 
WREMO has evolved from a traditional response-
focused organisation into a facilitator, helping its 
local councils and communities determine their own 
approaches and action plans. 

To achieve this, WREMO invested heavily in 
community development and participation, in 
order to involve partners more closely and to 
foster innovation. A strong emphasis on end-user 
perspectives and collaboration from the outset has 
become central to WREMO’s approach.

“ The most important thing we have learned over the 
past four years is that we have a responsibility to 
understand the needs of our end-users and adapt 
our operations to suit them, not us. This has forced 
us to re-examine much of what we thought we 
knew as emergency management professionals 
and modify how we think, engage, train and 
deliver. Because we’ve become better listeners, our 
partnerships are stronger than they have ever been 
and our communities now approach us with exciting 
ideas that we are able to explore together”.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
The future of emergency management in Melbourne 
and across Victoria will be shaped by global challenges 
and their local repercussions. As well as climate change 
– including more frequent and extreme weather events 
– we will face changes in population demographics and 
technology, and greater risk of pandemics and other 
security threats.

In this context, a major task is to ensure that our 
financial and human investments in emergency service 
agencies promote community resilience. In other words, 
these agencies must do more than simply fight fires 
or respond to other extreme events – they must 
support community wellbeing, liveability, sustainability 
and viability.

This requires emergency management agencies to 
collaborate not just across different response agencies, 
on which notable progress has been made, but with 
entirely different sectors altogether, as Emergency 
Management Victoria (EMV) states, ‘working in 
conjunction with Communities, Government, Agencies, 
and Business’. 

Emergency service agencies have broad and deep 
relationships with their communities, meaning they are 
well-placed to foster community resilience. However, 
traditional notions of ‘community’ in Melbourne are 
changing, which requires new approaches to engaging 
people. If our excellent emergency service agencies are 
to function as community resilience leaders, this will 
require some cultural change.

THE ACTION
This action will develop a comprehensive community 
resilience framework for Victoria’s emergency 
management sector. This is a key action of the Victorian 
Emergency Management Strategic Action Plan 2015–18, 
a three-year rolling plan that outlines the Victorian 
Government’s plans for creating safer and more resilient 
communities. The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office 
and EMV are working together to develop an approach 
to community resilience that is relevant to communities 
and the emergency management sector alike, and 
is practical and consistent across local governments 
and their communities, including business and 
community organisations.

The framework will be a lens through which sector-wide 
activities can be viewed, to ensure that that all activities 
have community benefit at their core. It will help the 
sector ensure that empowering communities and their 
leaders to develop awareness, shared responsibility and 
self-reliance will be part of all emergency management 
activities, plans, programs and systems.

EMV will map Victoria’s resilience challenges, using 
the Cities Resilience Framework, and highlight desired 
community outcomes (such as ‘protection against 
bushfire’ or ‘social connectedness’) against each 
emergency service agency’s roles and responsibilities. 
They will also identify which other actors are required 
to achieve the community outcomes. EMV will then 
consult on these findings, and use the responses to 
develop the framework and guidance for use.

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
•  Builds a shared understanding of resilience for the 

public and the emergency management sector.

•  Establishes a framework for embedding resilience in 

planning for emergencies and disasters in metropolitan 
Melbourne and beyond, improving alignment between 
agencies, local government and service providers.

•  Creates increased visibility of the roles of different 

actors, beyond just emergency management 
agencies, to achieve EMV’s vision of ‘safer, more 
resilient communities’.

Flood Management Strategy – Port Phillip and Westernport

We can’t always stop floods from happening, but 
we can plan for and manage the risks, and reduce 
the consequences. For this reason, the Flood 
Management Strategy – Port Phillip and Westernport 
was completed in 2015. It sets out how participating 
organisations will work together over the next 
five years to understand and better manage flood 
risks, support flood-emergency preparation and 
response, and achieve the best social, economic and 
environmental results.

The strategy was produced by Melbourne Water, 
in collaboration with more than 70 organisations, 
including local government, and 250 individuals. 

It sets the following long-term vision:

“ Together we are aware, responsive 
and resilient. Communities, business 
and government understand 
flooding, plan for challenges, and 
take action to manage risks.”
Melbourne Water is coordinating governance 
and implementation of actions in the strategy, 
with the input and participation of councils and

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
To equip communities to take active responsibility for 
their own and each other’s wellbeing, safety and health, 
we need to better understand what knowledge and 
resources individuals and communities need. An early 
insight from this work is that many Melburnians would 
like to support their neighbours more and be more 
active in their communities, but they feel they lack the 
skills or capacity to be more involved.

•  Improve the effectiveness of programs that encourage 

communities to know their neighbours and create

good and in times of crisis.

•  Provide a baseline for monitoring community activities 

and attitudinal changes. 

•  Work towards a more cohesive and connected city in 

the longer term.

THE ACTION
Resilient Melbourne has begun an attitudinal study 
that will help us to develop more effective programs 
to inspire and equip people to be more active in their 
communities. The research will provide us with:
•  A better understanding of Melburnians’ 

motivations and barriers to participating in 
community resilience activities

•  A better understanding of the issues, needs and 

opportunities associated with community members 
helping one another

•  A benchmark against which we can measure changes 

in beliefs and behaviours in the future.

This research will help the Resilient Melbourne Delivery 
Office and others (including the Community Resilience 
Unit – see page 151) develop programs that address 
community sentiment and individual attitudes about 
taking more responsibility, and help people reach out to 
others, create connections and support each other in 
good times and bad.

Multicultural water safety and settlement

Migration will be the greatest contributor to 
Victoria’s future population growth, with an average 
of 48,000 people estimated to arrive annually 
between 2006 and 2036. Programs that provide a 
solid foundation for cultural integration, as well as 
offering opportunities for people to learn valuable 
language and practical skills, are essential for the 
safety and wellbeing of our communities.

Life Saving Victoria’s multicultural water safety 
and settlement program teaches water skills to 
refugees, new arrivals and international students, 
and helps them settle in to Melbourne. The initiative 
includes swimming lessons, beach programs, a 
‘meet a lifeguard’ program in classrooms, regional 
open-water learning experiences, and accredited 
training programs. Perhaps most importantly, it 
gives participants the chance to establish new social 
networks, through the recreational, volunteer and 
employment opportunities it creates.

The initiative aims to remove barriers to 
participation, such as:
•  distance or lack of transport
•  cost of swimming lessons
•  lack of facilities and equipment
•  cultural and language differences
•  lack of ‘learn to swim’ and water safety 

programs in schools.

Program participation is up from 1,956 people in 
2006–07 to more than 13,000 people in 2014–15. 
All participants were reached via one of the 300 
partnering multicultural agencies and organisations.

There is now an opportunity for local government 
to work with Life Saving Victoria to extend the 
benefits in more centres across Melbourne. Other 
emergency management agencies are also looking at 
how they can build on the success of this program by 
incorporating similar culturally inclusive approaches 
into their activities (e.g. grass fire awareness).

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Currently, no single resource exists for understanding, 
promoting and sharing the many efforts that people 
across Melbourne make to help communities 
adapt, survive and thrive in the face of shocks and 
stresses. In many cases, efforts in different councils 
and communities produce unnecessary duplication.

THE ACTION
Monash University Disaster Resilience Initiative 
(MUDRI) and EMV are developing a community-based 
resilience compendium, which explores how different 
communities prepare and strengthen their response to 
disasters and emergencies.

Working with Resilient Melbourne, EMV and MUDRI 
are expanding the scope of the compendium, to take 
a broader view of urban resilience, encompassing not 
just shock events but actions and programs tackling 
the chronic stresses that weaken the fabric of our 
society. This will encourage more holistic discussion, 
collaboration and sharing knowledge on how to build a 
resilient Melbourne.

The community-based Resilience Compendium will 
identify and showcase leading practices and lessons 
learnt, facilitate networks so that communities can 
share and distribute community-based resilience 
ideas and successes to other communities, and 
document evidence for building more resilient and 
safer communities.

‘Refuge’: the role of art and culture in preparedness

‘Refuge’ will be a research-action event where artists 
and disaster management professionals work with 
local, regional and international communities to 
devise responses to a natural disaster scenario. The 
project, to be led by artists, will involve configuring 
Arts House and North Melbourne Town Hall as 
a place of community refuge, as a rehearsal in 
preparedness and building community networks and 
connections. Evaluation will contribute to policy 
on the role of artistic and cultural communities 
in emergency management plans, preparedness, 
resilience and recovery.

Over the five years of the project, Refuge will 
simulate four natural disaster scenarios:
•  seven days of extreme heat leads to city-wide 

power outages and reduced access to food 
and accommodation

•  a North Melbourne community hosts a 
community evacuated from Natimuk in 
western Victoria

•  a North Melbourne community is evacuated and 

hosted by the Natimuk community

•  a North Melbourne community hosts 
environmental refugees from Tuvalu.

Refuge is a collaboration between Arts House, 
the University of Melbourne, the Performing 
Studies International conference, and a range 
of organisations involved in emergency 
management in Victoria.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Each year, Australian communities suffer significant 
losses as a result of natural disasters and other 
unforeseen events. Personal insurance cover protects 
the assets of individuals and allows them to return to 
their former standard of living after such crises.

However, one in five Australian adults does not have 
general insurance cover for their home, contents or 
car.82 Generally, this is because they are unable to afford 
conventional insurance, or the level of cover available 
is too high for their need. The majority of these people 
are living on low incomes. For many of them, cars are 
a lifeline – without a car they might be unable to reach 
their place of work and might be cut off from essential 
services and established social networks.

Following an accident, theft or major crisis, people 
facing economic hardship are often unable to repair or 
replace assets that are essential for their livelihoods or 
basic needs. Given the increasing regularity and severity 
of natural disasters in Australia, and the risk of accident 
or theft, it is important that the assets of vulnerable 
members of the community are properly insured, to 
prevent people from slipping into further hardship or 
financial stress.

SURVIVE

105

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
•  Better insurance cover helps individuals and families 

recover from natural disasters, crises and bad luck 
events by enabling them to repair or replace 
critical assets.

•  By making personal insurance products available to 
low-income individuals, it helps people take active 
responsibility for their wellbeing, safety and health.
•  It will be a catalyst to competition and innovation in 
the low-income segment of the insurance market, 
where only one company currently offers a policy.

THE ACTION
This first element of this action is based on developing 
education sessions to encourage people who might 
otherwise be considered vulnerable to take out 
insurance cover, thus increasing their personal 
resilience. It will draw on local government networks 
and communication channels to reach members of the 
community who might not traditionally have insurance. 
The action will build on ‘Essentials’ by AAI Limited, 
an innovative insurance scheme that provides basic, 
affordable and accessible home and contents and car 
insurance to low-income individuals. Developed by 
Good Shepherd Microfinance in collaboration with 
Suncorp, ‘Essentials’ is for people who have a pension or 
healthcare card, receive regular Centrelink payments, or 
have an annual household income of less than $48,000. 
Customers can choose to insure their contents, car, 
or both, and pay their premium in annual, monthly or 
fortnightly instalments through Centrepay (Australian 
Government Department of Human Services).

Suncorp developed Essentials with a view to driving 
increased competition and innovation in the insurance 
industry, particularly around more accessible insurance 
offerings. The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office 
will build from this platform and work with additional 
partners to establish new forms of insurance at various 
scales, including for small businesses.

IBM Smarter Cities Challenge and Twitter data

Melbourne is ever more complex and we need 
to be able to communicate with our citizens in 
the most effective ways, particularly in times 
of severe disruption. At the moment, different 
organisations use different channels, depending 
on the situation. Further, citizens are self-
organising and using social media to inform one 
another when unexpected events occur.

As part of the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge, 
Melbourne is drawing on the expertise of senior 
IBM personnel to consider how we can make 
better use of technology to improve the resilience 
and safety of our citizens across our metropolitan 
region. IBM will also consider how social media 
information created by people in real time can 
help authorities respond to an unexpected event.

The City of Melbourne is one of three Smarter 
Cities selected in the 2015–16 cycle to receive 
an additional grant from Twitter. Twitter will 
provide access to both current and historic data 
relating to Melbourne, which can enable time-

This strategy is informed by the CSIRO and 
VicHealth’s Bright Futures report, which states 
that focusing on people 12–25 years old was 
important part of improving mental wellbeing in the 
community.84 The report notes the importance of 
educating and preparing people in this age group to 
be resilient and adaptable in a world characterised by 
decreasing job security, the fluidity of globalisation 

and technology, increasingly diverse societies and 
increasing exposure to the internet. These matters 
are all addressed to some degree in Resilient 
Melbourne. They are important to local government, 
which will work with VicHealth as appropriate.

The capacity to be autonomous, regulate one’s 
emotions, have self-confidence and empathy, and 
solve problems, are critical resilience abilities for our

The  metropolitan cycling network

Melbourne’s metropolitan councils will collaborate with citizens and Victoria’s main 
transport bodies to establish a metropolitan bicycle path network, to help make 
cycling a safer and more practical alternative to car travel.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Although Melbourne has an extensive network of public 
transport, the 2011 census found that 60.6 per cent of 
Melburnians drive a car to work.85 When coupled with 
a rapidly growing population, this heavy reliance on 
private vehicle travel is leading to increasing congestion 
on our roads. An Infrastructure Australia report 
recently predicted that the annual cost of congestion 
and delays on Melbourne’s road network will triple to 
$9 billion by 2031. It also forecast that demand on 
Melbourne’s public transport network will grow by 
89 per cent in the next 15 years.86

The mode and duration of commuting have been linked 
to health problems – for example, lengthy commutes 
contribute to higher stress levels, shorter sleeping 
times, and generally lower self-reported health. In inner 
Melbourne suburbs, where several transport types are 
available, 70 per cent of residents receive sufficient 
regular exercise and only 14 per cent are considered 
obese. By contrast, in Melbourne’s more car-dependent 
west, some 30 per cent (around 146,000 adults) are 
obese – the sixth-highest level of obesity and physical 
inactivity in Victoria.87

An important characteristic of a resilient city is 
flexibility – having a number of alternative ways to 
provide services and respond to changing circumstances. 
Similarly, resilient cities have redundancy built into 
their systems – this means intentionally having spare 
capacity, so that systems can continue to function 
should they experience an unexpected disruption. 
For mobility, this means giving people the ability to 
choose between multiple, effective modes of transport.

Redundancy and choice are also important in extreme 
events. For example, in the face of Super Storm Sandy, 
many New Yorkers used bicycles to make their way 
home from the city centre when buses, subway and 
overland trains could not operate.

Cycling is already very popular in Melbourne, with the 
Australian Bicycle Council estimating that 877,000 
Victorians ride a bicycle in a typical week.88 With 
40 per cent of all car trips in Melbourne being less than 
two kilometres, cycling is a good alternative in many 
cases.89 However, Melbourne’s disjointed network of 
bicycle paths discourages cycling in many areas, as 
missing links force cyclists to take less direct and more 
hazardous routes.

This work will link closely with the Victorian Cycling 
Strategy, which is currently being updated and will then 
be implemented by Active Transport Victoria, a unit 
in the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, 
Transport and Resources (DEDJTR).

This planning and coordination initiative furthers the 
objectives of the Victorian Government, specifically the 
Active Transport and cycling commitments outlined in 
Plan Melbourne, by:
•  pooling knowledge from researchers, government and 

infrastructure agencies and cycling advocacy groups

•  drawing on local government and infrastructure 

agency expertise to plan the metropolitan bicycle 
path network and connect existing bicycle paths, 
building on existing initiatives such as the Northern 
Trails initiative

•  encouraging local government and infrastructure 

agencies to build new bicycle paths.

Providing safer and more practical cycling routes across 
Melbourne will:
•  increase people’s transport choices, building additional 

redundancy into the transport network

•  make the community more connected, with greater 

opportunities for social interaction

•  encourage individuals to improve their health 

and wellbeing

•  reduce the use of cars for short journeys, reducing 

congestion and lowering emissions

•  make government transport spending more 

efficient, through improved planning, prioritisation 
and coordination.

in inner, middle and outer Melbourne municipalities. 
We anticipate that some of the developments will be 
entirely new, while others will be scheduled or already 
established, with developers willing to try new ways of 
putting residents at the heart of decision making.

Property companies and their partners will:
•  test a range of tools and frameworks, both existing 

(such as Green Star Communities, Ecodistricts) and 
new, to collaborate and share in decision making

•  measure results and report on their findings, working 

in conjunction with academic and other partners

•  contribute to a body of publicly available guidance on 

participatory planning across Melbourne.

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
•  Participating communities will be better able to 

influence and shape their neighbourhoods to meet 
their specific needs and interests. By fostering a 
greater connection with their home and those around 
them, residents are expected to benefit from better 
urban design and greater personal wellbeing.
•  Stronger community connectedness will be 

developed, enabling communities to cope better in 
times of shock or stress.

•  Based on these trials and published research, local 

government, property, utilities, transport and 
academic sectors should better understand how to 
use participatory planning to identify and deliver 
services that meet the needs of specific communities 
in different circumstances.

Traffic congestion is increasingly

reducing transport congestion in ways that increase positive social interactions.

SHOCKS

•  Transport infrastructure 

emergency

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Traffic congestion is a sign that current infrastructure 
is inadequate, as well as itself being a source of stress 
for individuals and communities. Congestion may 
also reflect people being forced to live further from 
their work owing to housing and other costs, weak 
local economies, and public transport options being 
impractical or simply less convenient than car travel. 

Congestion increases the costs and reduces the 
efficiency of business and households. Infrastructure 
Australia estimates the annual economic cost of 
Melbourne’s congestion at over $2 billion.90 Too often 
we look at the solution to congestion as one requiring 
significant investment in yet more infrastructure, 
ignoring the deep well of innovation that exists within 
the public at large and innovative businesses that 
may offer solutions frequently not considered by 
policy makers. 

Travel can lead to social interaction, but in congestion 
these interactions are less likely to be enlivening or 
uplifting. If people can be encouraged to get out of 
their cars, or to make better use of car transport, there 
may be opportunities to reduce the stress of congestion 
and to improve connections between neighbours and 
communities more broadly.

THRIVE

121

THE ACTION
Citymart, which is described in more detail below, 
will crowd-source potential solutions from around the 
world to achieve two important goals simultaneously: 
reducing congestion while promoting increased positive 
social interactions.

Citizens and entrepreneurs, locally and globally, 
will be encouraged to propose solutions to reducing 
Melbourne’s congestion. This will provide decision 
makers with access to a vast knowledge resource – 
citizens and entrepreneurs – to find innovative solutions 
to this increasingly pressing problem. An internationally 
recognised expert panel will assess ideas and identify a 
winning solution for implementation.

Initially, citizens and entrepreneurs will be asked four 
simple questions:
•  What is your idea for solving congestion 

in Melbourne?

•  How will it help people to interact better?
•  How ready is your solution?
•  How can we measure its success?

THE 100RC GLOBAL 
NETWORK IN ACTION
Citymart is currently working on related problems 
in the 100RC cities of Bristol, Da Nang and 
Oakland. The Resilient Melbourne Delivery 
Office will collaborate with these cities and their 
Chief Resilience Officers to share lessons.

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
•  The winning initiative will reduce congestion and 

improve social interactions.

•  The action will support a culture of social 

entrepreneurialism and a society that is adaptable 
and open to innovation.

ALIGNED LOCAL ACTION
Melbourne Metro Rail Project

While Resilient Melbourne supports diversifying 
local economies across Melbourne, our resilience 
as a metropolitan area also depends on a strong, 
accessible, central city. 

Currently, Melbourne’s 15 radial suburban train lines 
feed into Melbourne’s central business district via the 
City Loop tunnel. This creates a major bottleneck in 
our public transport network and prevents us from 
increasing network capacity to serve our rapidly 
growing population.

In 2015, the Victorian Government announced 
the construction of a 9 kilometre rail tunnel from 
Kensington in the city’s north, to South Yarra, via the 
central city. The Melbourne Metro Rail Project will 
also deliver five new stations and cost approximately 
$10.9 billion, with works to begin in 2017.

Melbourne Metro will reduce the rail network’s 
vulnerability to failure by providing entirely 
separate end-to-end lines from Sunbury in the 
west to Cranbourne-Pakenham in the south-east. 
Additionally, 39,000 more passengers will be able 
to reach and leave the central city during the 
morning and afternoon travel peaks.

Greater capacity on the public transport network 
will reduce congestion across all modes of transport. 
The project will be equivalent to removing 18,000 
cars from the city’s roads during the busiest hours 
of the day, and will provide public transport users 
with an alternative to taking trams along Swanston 
Street, currently the city’s busiest tram and 
pedestrian corridor.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Australia’s performance on international innovation 
indicators is one of the lowest among OECD 
countries.91 From a mental health perspective, we have 
a limited understanding of the relationship between 
risk and resilience, and we often don’t translate new 
evidence about resilience and vulnerability into policy 
and practices. Involving young people in making 
decisions is essential if we are to improve in this respect.

In Australia, 14 per cent of children aged 4–12 years 
have mental health problems, rising to 19 per cent 
among adolescents (13–17 years) and 27 per cent for 
young adults (18–24 years).92 Twenty per cent of young 
people aged 12 to 25 had personally experienced a 
mental health, alcohol or other substance use problem 
in the last five years.93

Young and Resilient living labs will bring together 
young people, researchers, policy makers, employers, 
health practitioners, parents and technology providers 
to investigate, design, create and test innovative 
technology-based strategies that equip young people 
to tackle personal problems and promote individual, 
community and social wellbeing. The laboratories will:
•  develop and test strategies for minimising harm 

and supporting the resilience of young people and 
their communities

•  research the role of technologies in the lives 

of young people

•  foster processes for generating new software, apps, 

initiatives and enterprises that help young people build

ALIGNED LOCAL ACTION
Preventing Violence Together

Launched in 2010 and led by Women’s Health West, 
Preventing Violence Together (PVT) is the regional 
partnership and action plan for primary prevention 
of violence against women in Melbourne’s west. 
Involving 18 signatory organisations, the action plan 
was the first of its kind in Victoria, and is now being 
replicated across Melbourne’s regions.

Achievements of the PVT partnership include:
•  working with 57 executive leaders on gender equity
•  staff training on preventing violence 

against women in culturally and linguistically 
diverse communities

•  developing resources, including gender 

audit guidelines

•  advocacy, including a submission to the Victorian 

Royal Commission into Family Violence.

In Melbourne’s southeast, the Together 
We Can initiative is also tackling family violence. 
Led by Cardinia Shire Council, Family Life and the 
University of Melbourne, it brings together the 
efforts and resources of a range of organisations, 
including schools, businesses, all levels of government, 
and the community sector. The process began with 
a community convention, held in late April 2016, to 
share what is already working well, identify what is 
still needed, and start finding solutions together.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Australian students are faced with a growing number of 
career and education choices, but not all are equipped 
to make fully informed decisions. We need to help 
students make smart choices about their futures, and 
we must communicate the advantages and value of 
careers in STEM, in a way that is inclusive and actively 
reaches out to disadvantaged and isolated students.

This is particularly important in Melbourne: our 
economy is rapidly shifting from its traditional 
manufacturing base. Meanwhile, we have high rates 
of immigration, meaning that many people do not 
have established networks that open up employment 
opportunities, while long-time residents may have 
very strong networks that can be hard for new arrivals 
to penetrate.

THE ACTION
LifeJourney is a social-purpose driven business that lets 
students test-drive future STEM careers and learn from 
top industry professionals through a free, interactive, 
online platform which in Australia is known as The Day 
of STEM. It links students with mentors in a secure 
online environment, allowing students to get a real-life 
appreciation of what happens in the professional world 
and how these executives got to where they are today. 
It also provides an opportunity to learn about STEM 
careers, develop new skills, and to understand industry 
challenges facing Australia now and in the future. The 
goal is to help students find their own passion and 
identify career paths that they may not otherwise have 
known to be available to them.

LifeJourney’s technology enables a single mentor to 
inspire and guide 10,000 or more students at the same 
time and has an ambitious target of reaching 2.5 million 
students across Australia, with potentially up to 1 million 
in Melbourne alone. 

The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office is working 
with LifeJourney to tailor the Day of STEM service so 
that local government and other partners can help the 
service to reach our young people who are least likely to 
get this guidance from any other source. 

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
The action will:
•  provide inclusive opportunities for a broad range of 

students to learn about STEM careers

•  promote mathematical and scientific literacy across 

Melbourne’s population

•  foster a job market that is equipped with the skillsets 

that match the needs of the economy.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Melbourne’s small to medium enterprises (SMEs) 
are essential to our city’s vitality. In addition to being 
an indicator of and contributor to the success of our 
economy, these businesses are highly vulnerable to 
shocks and stresses. Following an extreme event, 
one-third of affected SMEs close and never reopen.94 

THE ACTION
To help Melbourne’s SMEs understand their biggest 
business problems and vulnerabilities, and put 
management plans in place, the Resilient Melbourne 
Delivery Office will work with B Lab Australia & New 
Zealand to deliver ‘B Corporation’ training to SMEs. 
This will use the basic ‘B Impact Assessment’, which 
is a free online resource that helps businesses to 
understand their business operations and their impacts. 
It is therefore an affordable way for SMEs and emerging 
businesses to prepare for future shocks and stresses. 
It also provides a platform and tools for interested 
businesses to understand and improve the social and 
environmental effects of their operations.

Students from Melbourne’s business schools, working 
through established business training programs, will help 
deliver training on applying the B Impact Assessment 
and taking actions based on the assessment findings, 
giving mature and experienced students access to 
new networks, while providing SMEs with affordable

30-year Infrastructure Strategy for Victoria

A key challenge for a resilient Melbourne is 
developing and maintaining the infrastructure 
needed to support a thriving, competitive city. 
In pursuit of this, Infrastructure Victoria was 
established in 2015 as an independent statutory 
authority to guide decision making on Victoria’s 
infrastructure needs and priorities. It provides 
expert advice to government, undertakes research 
and prepares a 30-year infrastructure strategy 
for Victoria.

Work on the 30-year strategy, which will outline 
short-, medium- and long-term infrastructure 
priorities, is now under way. The strategy will cover 
energy, water and waste, transport, education and 
training, health and human services, justice, culture, 
civics, science and agriculture, and information and 
communications technologies (ICT). Consultation 
will occur throughout 2016, with the final strategy 
to be published by the end of the year.

One of the 30 draft objectives is ‘build resilience 
to shocks’, as unexpected events are likely to disrupt 
Victoria’s society, environment and economy 
over the coming decades. These shocks could be 
anything from natural disasters, pandemics, ICT 
disruptions, global economic crises and terrorism, 
to relatively minor but more frequent disruptions 
to transport networks.

Victoria’s vulnerability to these shocks will partly 
be determined by the resilience and adaptability 
of its infrastructure. Infrastructure Victoria’s 
30-year strategy aims to ensure that Victoria’s 
infrastructure is able to adapt and respond positively 
to unexpected events.

Infrastructure Victoria is working with the Resilient 
Melbourne Delivery Office to best align our 
respective efforts.

EMBED

In a resilient Melbourne resilience thinking, planning and actions will be core to our 
institutions and ways of working.

To achieve our objectives and enable our communities to 
adapt, thrive and survive, our various levels of government 
and our organisations must ensure that their policies 
and practices actively increase our collective resilience. 
They need to understand how they can actively improve 
community resilience, through their own decisions, the 
cultures they foster and how they cooperate. Existing 
and emerging organisations need to consider resilience 
consequences  in all they do and be prepared to manage 

the shocks and stresses that may directly impact 
them in order to contribute to the resilience of our city 
as a whole.

And we need to track our progress. Identifying 
successes and learning from mistakes will help 
us communicate honestly and clearly with our 
communities, supporting them in their own efforts.

Statement of support from Michael Berkowitz, 
Chief Executive Officer and President of 100 Resilient Cities

“We at 100 Resilient Cities commend Melbourne for 
the way it is taking on the challenge of working at a 
metropolitan scale, working with existing structures 
and governance models in new ways to deliver resilience 
dividends for its communities.

Numerous 100RC cities work in similar metropolitan 
arrangements so learning how to address resilience issues 
at this scale is critical. Additionally, cities are increasingly 
globally interconnected, so learning alongside Melbourne 
about collaboration at a local scale will help us to better 
collaborate globally.

The idea of a temporary Office to embed resilience 
into existing institutions and organisations is novel. 
Conceptually it makes sense. Most importantly, if it is 
right in Melbourne’s local context, that should be the 
greatest determinant of success and we will look for what 
lessons others may draw from this.

We believe that the initial 100RC Platform Partners 
with whom you are working, including CSIRO, 
The Nature Conservancy, Trimble and Citymart, will 
provide an incredible starting point for implementing 
this strategy. The ability of the Office to draw from 
these and other platform partners as you go forward 
will add notable weight to the resources able to be 
shared across Melbourne.

We wish you well in your efforts – now the hard work 
really begins as you move from strategy making to true 
resilience-building. We are committed to working with you 
as you take this next step. We hope that as a collective of 
32 local government areas working together and across 
sectors you live up to your aspiration of being a city 
that others look to for advice and support on resilience-
building. We look forward to being with you and being part 
of that great knowledge sharing.”

LEARNING FROM OTHERS – BARCELONA
In 2007 the City of Barcelona was grappling with a 
mix of infrastructure and environmental difficulties 
that may be familiar to Melburnians. The city was 
in the midst of Spain’s worst drought in 40 years, 
leading to stringent water restrictions, construction 
of desalination plants and serious consequences 
for water-dependent businesses. Around the same 
time, it experienced a major electricity outage that 
left more than 350,000 households and businesses 
without power for more than 56 hours.

In response, the City of Barcelona developed the 
3S (Security of Services Supply) project, which 
brought together infrastructure owners, operators 
and government agencies to better understand 
vulnerabilities and interconnections between 
different elements of the urban infrastructure. 
The assessments identified that the city’s 

infrastructure management systems were not well 
integrated and did not have extra capacity that could 
be drawn upon should basic systems fail.

These findings were acted upon by multi-stakeholder 
working groups called Urban Resilience Boards, 
which have identified and managed more than 40 
projects to better prepare Barcelona for future shock 
events. Projects included setting up a ‘situation 
room’ that coordinates information critical to the 
day-to-day functioning of the city, and undertaking 
a comprehensive audit of Barcelona’s network of 
tunnels. Following the success of the projects, the 
city created the Department of Urban Resilience 
to coordinate resilience-related efforts and 
collaborate with international institutions to 
share ideas and experiences.

The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Offi  ce

Establish an office to oversee implementation of Resilient Melbourne; develop 
a range of capacities in metropolitan local government; and embed resilience 
principles and actions more broadly across metropolitan Melbourne and 
relevant institutions. 

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
Resilient Melbourne has been developed through 
collaboration across sectors, led by local government. 
If we are to realise its full potential, this collaboration 
will need to continue and grow, drawing in more 
organisations, communities and individuals. The launch 
of this strategy is just the starting point.

In the short term, resources are needed to put in place 
the actions proposed in this strategy. To make sure that 
the resilience vision for Melbourne’s communities lives 
beyond this first strategy, further resources and ongoing 
leadership are needed, to build on the partnerships and
networks already established through Resilient Melbourne.

“ There is a unique opportunity to link the resilience of our communities to the council 
planning processes, as well as council budgets currently under development. There 
may be existing allocations for actions and specific programs, and in some cases, 
councils may be undertaking existing actions and programs that can be built upon.”

The Office will manage the generation, holding and 
dispersal of funds from private sector and philanthropic 
partners, and the pro-bono contributions of services 
from 100RC Platform Partners, to create a lasting, 
multi-sectoral approach to preparing Melbourne for the 
future and its emerging challenges. It will also establish 
close links with the City of Melbourne professorial 
chair in resilient cities (p. 148) and be a bridge between 
local partners and 100RC, for sharing knowledge 
and resources.

Through these activities, the Office will support 
Melbourne’s resilience and contribute to national and 
international resilience-building.

Reporting on Melbourne’s resilience eff orts
Providing feedback to our communities and institutions 
on Melbourne’s current resilience, and on the 
results of resilience-building projects that have been 
implemented, will be critical in maintaining support for 
this strategy, and bringing about change. The Office 
will report on the state of city resilience as well as on 
effectiveness of each individual action proposed in 
Resilient Melbourne.

The Delivery Office will inform through a range of 
channels, including annual report processes. The 
Office will continue to improve its website to become 
a substantial resource of resilience information for 
Melbourne, drawing from local actions, as well as from 
the 100RC network.

THE ACTION
The temporary Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office 
(the Office) is being established for a five year 
period to provide sufficient time to deliver on the 
commitments made in this strategy and to determine 
the appropriate organisations to achieve resilience 
outcomes for many years to come.

The Office has been created to unite the efforts made 
by numerous organisations and individuals over the past 
18 months. It will oversee the implementation of this 
strategy, supported in particular by the 32 councils of 
Melbourne; Emergency Management Victoria; the 
Municipal Association of Victoria; the Department 
of Environment, Land, Water and Planning; and the 
Department of Premier and Cabinet. 

The Office will help ensure that the actions described in 
Resilient Melbourne are implemented successfully, and 
maintain the involvement of Melbourne councils and 
other partners. It will oversee the establishment of a 
governance structure for each action, refinement of the 
actions, development of new actions, and monitoring 
and reporting on progress of the actions. Additionally, 
the Office will work with local government and its 
relevant associations to embed resilience-building 
actions in council plans and processes.

The Office will ensure the delivery of the next strategy 
and determine the appropriate organisations and 
institutions to do this work beyond the five years of the 
Office’s operation. Linked to this, it will advocate for 
resilience principles to be built into relevant policies and 
actions. For example, Resilient Melbourne coordinated 
a submission from local government CEOs to the 
current review of Victoria’s Local Government Act 1989. 
This is a major opportunity for Melbourne’s 32 councils 
to formally integrate resilience principles into the way 
they do business, by making resilience-building activities 
an explicit objective in the revised Act.

Evaluation and review
Before we implement an action, we will agree 
performance measures. Evaluating how actions work 
in practice will be essential to building resilience. Little 
in Resilient Melbourne has a guaranteed result. Indeed, 
a great part of the value of this work is a willingness to 
experiment, to try out new ways of working together. 
Evaluating actions, changing them if necessary, and 
being open about what has and has not worked, will be 
a significant benefit of Resilient Melbourne, both locally 
and across the 100RC network.

To assess its own effectiveness, the Office will use 
the LBG international methodology for measuring 
community impact (http://www.lbg-online.net/). This 
will help us understand what resources the Office has 
attracted to our collective efforts, how those resources 
have been used, and what has been achieved.

Monitoring
While developing Resilient Melbourne, we established 
a Resilience Indicators Community of Practice. 
Bringing together organisations with roles central to 
understanding Melbourne’s resilience, it will agree 
measures of Melbourne’s resilience, gather relevant 
data, improve its accessibility and quality.

Organisations participating in the Resilience Indicators 
Community of Practice include the Community 
Resilience Unit of the Department of Premier and 
Cabinet, VicHealth, the Australian Urban Research 
Infrastructure Network, Community Indicators 
Victoria, several universities, and other organisations 
already funding resilience-related research, such as the 
Scanlon Foundation’s work on social cohesion.95 

Melbourne’s 32 councils are already crucial to these 
efforts, as they research and analyse demographic, 
economic, environmental and property information 
to plan for and support their services, community 
programs and capital projects.

In addition to such sources, we intend to apply the 
City Resilience Index, based on the City Resilience 
Framework developed by the Rockefeller Foundation 
and 100RC. This will enable us to monitor our 
resilience in line with other cities globally, enabling 
further collaboration.

City of Melbourne professorial 
chair in resilient cities

Establish a professorial position to lead and coordinate academic work on practical 
resilience-building actions in Melbourne.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
A wide range of activities has already contributed to 
Melbourne’s current level of urban resilience. At the 
same time, research conducted over the past 18 months 
through 100RC and others has led to new ways of 
thinking on the subject. Melbourne’s strong academic 
institutions can help make our city a prominent 
contributor to emerging international urban resilience 
practices. To understand how to apply urban resilience 
across the city, Melbourne’s academic bodies need to be 
part of international resilience research and involved in 
its local implementation.

THE ACTION
The professorial chair in resilient cities is being 
established at the University of Melbourne, in 
partnership with the City of Melbourne. This chair 
will coordinate academic work in the field of resilience 
between the university, the City of Melbourne and 
a range of external parties, including universities 
across Melbourne.

The chair will work with all of the University of 
Melbourne’s faculties and interests, and will play a key 
role in influencing and stimulating local and international 
public debate and policy in urban resilience. The 
incumbent will also support the efforts of the Resilient 
Melbourne Delivery Office and will help build 
knowledge and embed resilience into academic research 
projects and other activities. This will likely include being 
an important contributor to the Resilience Indicators 
Community of Practice (p. 145).

All: Melbourne 
University’s new school 
of design building was 
opened in October, 2014.

ALIGNED LOCAL ACTION
Working to embed resilience and build social cohesion

In May 2015, the Hon. Daniel Andrews MP, 
Premier of Victoria, announced the establishment 
of the Social Cohesion and Community Resilience 
Taskforce. Its aim is to facilitate collective action 
across governments, community and academia to 
strengthen social cohesion and community resilience, 
and prevent violent extremism. The Community 
Resilience Unit in the Department of Premier and 
Cabinet was established to support the Taskforce. 

The Taskforce recognised that the issues are 
complex, difficult to understand and interconnected, 
and that steps taken by governments alone will 
not succeed. Thus the Strategic Framework to 
Strengthen Victoria’s Social Cohesion and the 

Resilience of its Communities was developed, in 
partnership with communities, academics, service 
providers, philanthropic foundations, businesses and 
other interested parties.96 

This document identifies ways for governments, 
communities, families and young people to work 
together on projects that promote social inclusion. 
The Resilient Melbourne Delivery Office and 
metropolitan councils will continue working closely 
with the Community Resilience Unit to strengthen 
Melbourne’s social cohesion. The Taskforce has been 
funded for four years.

Resilience training for local government

152

Resilience training for local government

Incorporate resilience principles into all levels of the local government sector, 
through a new training program aimed at officer-level staff and above.

Although the training must cover much more than 
emergency management, it will reflect the findings of 
Local Government Victoria’s current review of local 
government’s capability and capacity in managing 
emergencies. We will also work with the Department 
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on a project 
to help those 1,400 Victorian organisations that deliver 
services for DHHS in emergency situations (which 
include local councils) to be better prepared and 
more resilient.

RESILIENCE CHALLENGE
The Commonwealth and Victorian governments, as 
well as local governments, all develop policies and 
actions that have major implications for the ability of 
Melbourne and its communities to withstand, respond 
to, and thrive in the face of shocks and stresses. Local 
government is increasingly responsible for implementing 
such policies, often with limited resources, particularly 
in the area of emergency management and in dealing 
with the unintended consequences of policy and 
funding changes.

THE ACTION
A resilience training program is being developed for local 
government employees across metropolitan Melbourne. 
It is based on leading global practice in urban resilience 
and will equip council officers with the knowledge and 
resources to incorporate resilience principles into their 
day-to-day decision making, processes and cultures.

EMBED

153

BENEFITS – HOW DOES THE ACTION 
SUPPORT OUR RESILIENCE OBJECTIVES?
•  Incorporating urban resilience principles into local 
government cultures will lead to more robust, long-
term, inclusive policies and implementation plans.

•  Greater cooperation will lead to more efficient and 

effective services.

•  Officers in all councils will better understand 

resilience thinking and will learn practical ways to 
incorporate resilience planning into council actions.

What comes next?

Thank you for your interest in Resilient Melbourne. 
It is one step in an on-going approach that builds on the 
tremendous efforts and achievements of many people, 
over a long time, to make Melbourne a successful, 
inclusive and modern city.

The actions in Resilient Melbourne test out new ways of 
working. By monitoring their results on several levels, 
we will not only learn what works well and what could 
be improved for specific actions, but also how different 
actions may combine to produce greater, and sometimes 
unexpected, benefits.

By drawing on our shared experiences, and learning 
from these and future actions, together we will foster 
a resilient Melbourne, a city that is viable, sustainable, 
liveable and prosperous, long into the future.

Please be part of the effort. Identify actions you would 
like to be involved in or let us know of actions that you 
think are already contributing to our objectives. We 
are constantly looking for new partners, new ways of 
working and new ways to finance and resource actions.

Questions and answers –
with Chief Resilience Officer, Toby Kent

Over the last 18 months I have had the privilege of meeting with hundreds of 
leading actors across government, academic, business, infrastructure, emergency 
management, environment, community and health sectors. With the support 
of the Resilient Melbourne team, we have fielded a range of questions about 
the Resilient Melbourne initiative and resilience thinking more generally. Below 
are some of the most frequently asked questions. The Glossary on page 163 also 
contains some useful definitions.

What is resilience?
This project uses the 100RC definition of urban 
resilience: the capacity of individuals, institutions, 
businesses and systems within a city to adapt, survive 
and thrive no matter what kind of chronic stresses and 
acute shocks they experience.

What are shocks and stresses?
Shocks are sudden, often unexpected, events that 
threaten a city. Examples include bushfires, floods 
and heatwaves. Stresses are longer-term problems 
that weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or 
cyclical basis. Examples include sea-level rise, increasing 
pressures on healthcare services, unemployment, 
stretched public transport systems, and high levels 
of family violence.

Is resilience the same as sustainability? 
What about liveability?
Resilience in Melbourne’s context incorporates 
elements of sustainability and liveability. 

Sustainability means balancing economic, social and 
environmental factors. It is concerned with how we can 
manage resources to ensure future generations have 
the same opportunities that we enjoy today.

Liveability is the sum of many elements that contribute 
to quality of life. These include the built and natural 
environments, economic prosperity, social stability, 
and access to educational, cultural, entertainment and 
recreational opportunities.

Although successful cities are sustainable and liveable, 
they may still be vulnerable to shocks and stresses. 
Cities must evolve and adapt in response to changing 
circumstances, such as population growth, a volatile 
global economy and climate change. Without this 
adaptability, accumulating stresses or sudden shocks can 
put liveable and sustainable cities at risk, resulting in social 
breakdown, physical collapse or economic deprivation.

Why is being ‘viable’ part of the vision? 
Surely Melbourne is already viable?
Melbourne today is undoubtedly a viable city. However, 
the nature of resilience thinking means we cannot 
simply take our current situation for granted. If 
Melbourne is to remain viable and liveable in the long 
term, we need to acknowledge our own vulnerabilities 
and work hard to overcome them. To achieve a truly 
desirable future we should be prepared to consider 
the undesirable, including what it would look like were 
communities or the city as a whole to be ‘unviable’. 
We must equip ourselves, building on our strong 
foundations, so that when disruptions happen, our 

156

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

communities and systems can cope and recover, 
collectively and as individuals.

Who prepared this strategy?
Resilient Melbourne is a true collaboration across levels of 
government, business and community. This document 
was drafted by the Resilient Melbourne Project Team 
(based at City of Melbourne), with the assistance of our 
strategy partner AECOM, and supported by 100RC. 
Senior leaders and staff from metropolitan Melbourne’s 
councils were key contributors and reviewers of 
the strategy.  

For more detail on the strategy development 
process, see pages 14-15. For the members of the 
Resilience Project Team, Resilient Melbourne Steering 
Committee, and Strategy Review Panel, see page 158.

How does this ﬁ t with other strategies like 
Plan Melbourne and the State Water Plan?
Resilient Melbourne aims to incorporate resilience 
thinking into all that we do, as well as build on existing 
resilience-building efforts. Therefore, links to existing 
documents such as Plan Melbourne and the State 
Water Plan are crucial.

For example, Resilient Melbourne has been developed 
with the involvement of the Community Resilience 
Unit of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, which 
recently released the Strategic Framework to Strengthen 
Victoria’s Social Cohesion and the Resilience of its 
Communities. This close association will continue as we 
implement Resilient Melbourne.

Is this just a strategy for local government?
No. Although Melbourne’s councils are essential to the 
resilience of Melbourne’s diverse communities, many 
of the problems that our city faces are too complex and 

interconnected for local governments to address on 
their own. Everything in Resilient Melbourne is relevant 
to local government, but responsibility for implementing 
its proposals needs to be shared.

Resilient Melbourne must encourage new collaborations 
and ways of working between individuals, businesses and 
government institutions to achieve the shared goal of a 
resilient Melbourne.

Isn’t this work the state or federal 
government’s responsibility?
Yes. But responsibility is not limited to state and 
federal governments; creating a resilient Melbourne 
is the responsibility of us all. Councils, individuals, 
communities, businesses, academics, not-for-profit 
organisations – all have responsibilities and roles to play.

While this strategy provides a starting point, progress 
towards greater resilience ultimately needs to be led 
by the citizens of Melbourne. A resilient city needs a 
large number of resilient individuals and families in its 
communities – such cities are better able to respond 
quickly and effectively to shocks and stresses.

Why don’t I see more actions addressing our 
infrastructure shortcomings?
Resilient Melbourne focuses on areas where local 
government is well placed to take a leading role. While 
councils manage important municipal infrastructure, 
much of Victoria’s critical infrastructure (such as energy 
supply networks) and transport systems (such as major 
roads) is managed at the state and federal levels. Any 
problems with these will need significant public and 
private investment to fix. This document highlights 
several major infrastructure initiatives being undertaken 
at a state level that are not led by Resilient Melbourne, 
but that share the same aims (p. 125 and p. 137).
