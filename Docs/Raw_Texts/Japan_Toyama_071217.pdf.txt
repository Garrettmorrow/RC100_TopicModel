RESILIENTTOYAMALetter from the Mayor

Our city is located in the center of Japan on the 
Japan Sea. With a population of approximately 
420,000, the city is blessed with beautiful nature, 
extending from the 1,000 meter deep rich marine 
waters of Toyama Bay to the 3,000 meter crest of the 
Northern Japan Alps, a remarkable vertical span of 
some 4,000 meters. Famous for its pharmaceutical 
industry and advanced city planning, Toyama is a 
vibrant regional hub on the Sea of Japan with a wide 
variety of industries complementing its long cultural 
and artistic history.

When I had the privilege of being elected Mayor 
of Toyama in 2005, we set out to revitalize the 
city and tackle multiple issues such as the crucial 
challenges in Japanese society of depopulation, a 
low child birth rate and an ultra-aging society, as 
well as the deterioration of public transportation 
caused by excess dependency on cars, suburban 
flight, and decreased residential density in the city 
center. Through city-wide discussions and more than 
200 two hour meetings with citizens, we devised 
a compact city plan to meet these challenges. 
Announced in 2008, our compact city plan, which 
began with the key element of revitalizing public 
transportation and then moved step-by-step to 
related projects, has achieved clear success in 
reversing suburban flight, rebuilding our public 
transportation ridership and reinvigorating the city.    

Toyama was selected as one of the 100 Resilient 
Cities in December 2014. Under the direction of CRO 
Dr. Joseph Runzo-Inada we have re-examined and 
realigned current city development policies within a 
future resilience framework and vision for sustainable 
development and natural and manmade crisis 
management, based on strong cooperation from a 
broad range of stakeholders and NGOs and IGOs. 
Our “Toyama Resilience Strategy”, the first of its kind 
in Japan under the 100 Resilient Cities program, will 
be responsible for ensuring cross-cutting approaches 
to city policies and strategies. The city will continue 
to robustly cooperate with citizens and the business 
community to create our future resilience strategies 
through our collective strength and we especially 
hope this can be a model for other cities.

I would like to deeply thank 100RC and especially 
Michael Berkowitz for their invaluable support in this 
process. Finally, I would like to extend my gratitude 
to all our citizens, business partners, advisors and 
city staff members who participated in this strategy 
development.

RESILIENTTOYAMALetter from the Chief Resilience Officer

Letter from the President, 100 Resilient Cities

The success of Toyama’s Resilience Strategy would 
not have been possible without the unstinting efforts 
of the many dedicated people committed to helping 
Toyama realize its resilience vision. 

Our resilience journey began in December 2013 in 
Marseilles at the OECD Roundtable of Mayors, where 
Mayor Mori and I presented the Toyama plan for 
sustainability. Afterwards, the Rockefeller Foundation 
representative suggested that Toyama would be ideal 
for the 100 Resilient Cities initiative and encouraged 
the Mayor to apply. At the ensuing 2014 World Cities 
Summit in Singapore, I met with Michael Berkowitz 
who generously gave me his time to (I might add 
persuasively) explain the intent and value of the 
program. We immediately assembled an application 
committee representing key city departments and 
began generating enthusiasm for the program. 

No comprehensive plan for a city’s future can be 
successful without effective, visionary leadership and 
I cannot say enough how fortunate Toyama is to have 
one of the most respected mayors in Japan, Mayor 
Masashi Mori.  Now beginning his fourth consecutive 
4-year term, it is Mayor Mori’s inspirational compact 
city vision which has laid the foundation for Toyama’s 
success and garnered national and international 
acclaim. Among senior city officials, Vice Mayor 
Masayoshi Imamoto and Director General Shinji 
Honda have been stalwart supporters of Toyama’s 
resilience journey. Among the many citizens who 
have participated in our resilience journey, we are 
especially thankful for the prominent CEOs and 
Presidents of Toyama companies, academic leaders 
and NGO presidents, who devoted their time and 
leadership to our Working Groups.

100RC’s innovative conception of a Chief Resilience 
Officer (CRO) has been instrumental to Toyama’s 
success. Though I was the principal writer of 
Toyama’s application to 100RC, it was entirely 
unexpected when Mayor Mori asked me to serve as 
Toyama’s CRO and I am grateful to the Mayor and 
100RC for this honor and the exciting opportunities 
it has afforded. Among the many supportive staff 
of 100RC, we are especially grateful to President 
Michael Berkowitz for his inspiration and constant 

support and to Horng Dar Lim, Associate Director in 
the Singapore Office, who has aided and encouraged 
us at every turn. Arup is our 100RC Strategy Partner 
and Laura Frost has been the key person helping us 
in the formulation and formatting of this Strategic 
Plan report.

We have learned from many cities in the 100RC 
network and I especially want to thank these fellow 
CROs for their inspiration and advice: Timothy 
Burroughs (Berkeley), Grant Ervin (Pittsburgh), Mike 
Gillooly (Christchurch), Jeff Hebert (New Orleans), 
Mike Mendonca (Wellington), Oscar Santiago 
Uribe Rocha (Medellin), Purnomo Dwi Sasongko, 
(Semarang), Sarah Toy (Bristol), and Kamlesh 
Yagnik, (Surat). We have also been fortunate to 
receive exceptional advice from representatives of 
100RC Platform Partners, and I want to particularly 
thank Senior Director Tony Newling of Microsoft, VP 
Business Development Cities for Veolia, Christine 
Rodwell; Director Thomas Kessler of Swiss Re, and 
VP Dr. Ingeborg Rocker of Dassault Systems. As 
a World Bank Partner City, Toyama has greatly 
benefited in our resilience planning from the Bank 
and for this we are especially grateful to Philip Karp, 
Lead Knowledge Management Specialist for Social, 
Urban and Rural Resilience, and Senior Operations 
Officer Dan Levine, Tokyo Center, Social, Urban, and 
Rural Resilience.

Finally there would be no Strategic Plan without 
the invaluable dedication and hard work of the 
thirteen members of our Office of Strategic Planning 
and Resilience, and there will be no future success 
without the enduring resilient spirit of Toyama’s 
citizens. 

Dr. Joseph Runzo-Inada
CRO Toyama City
Head of Strategic Planning and Resilience

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I 
want to congratulate the city of Toyama and Mayor 
Mori, on the release of the city’s Resilience Strategy, a 
major milestone for the city and 100 RC’s partnership 
with it.  This document builds on Toyama pioneering 
past efforts as it lays out an extraordinary vision 
of urban resilience for its future.  Importantly, this 
Strategy is also a first for Japan and we hope it will 
serve to inspire other cities in this great nation to 
learn from Toyama’s example and work to build a 
more resilient future.

Set between sea and sky, along the Sea of Japan and 
the Northern Japanese Alps, Toyama boasts a rich 
environmental heritage along with its storied cultural 
and artistic traditions. It also has a history of having 
to overcome immense challenges and recreating 
itself into the modern technological hub it is today. 
As it contends with its current shocks, such as 
flooding, and the severe stresses relating to its aging 
population, low birth rate, and resulting reduced tax 
base, Toyama draws on this past of perseverance and 
regeneration. 

Toyama’s Strategy makes its people and history 
central to its resilience and to the four elements 
around which the city’s resilience is structured: 
Resilient Infrastructure; Resilient Prosperity; Resilient 
People; and Resilient Environment. Together they 
form an inter-systemic blueprint for a vibrant 
future, which address the city’s environmental 
and demographic shocks and stresses, such as 
improvement to public transportation to improve 
accessibility for all residents; preservation of rural 
and agricultural communities; upgrade and seismic 
retrofits of community centers; creating a human 
resources bank to facilitate employment of senior 
citizen retirees; and promoting an active cultural 
and artistic  life for all citizens; among many others. 
The four elements complement one another, and 
truly reflect the need to plan holistically to create 
meaningful resilience.

Through the commitment and leadership of Mayor 
Mori and Chief Resilience Officer Dr. Runzo-
Inada, the city has already begun the hard work of 
institutionalizing resilience. With a robust resilience 
program that incorporates resilience into strategic 
planning for the city, and the full political support of 
all city sectors.  

Extensive engagement with the business and 
NGO community have also laid the foundation for 
successful implementation, and for enriching the 
lives of all who live in Toyama.  Long ago, the city 
recognized the opportunities it could unlock through 
collaboration with the private sector, especially 
as it builds towards a future of growth and shared 
prosperity.

Through his energetic leadership in Toyama, and 
the 100RC network, Dr. Runzo-Inada has guided the 
city to this major moment. His collaboration with 
other CROs and partners in the 100RC network have 
already proven that Toyama will be a major part 
of the urban resilience movement to realizing real 
change world-wide.  

Though this strategy represents the end of the 
strategic planning process in Toyama, it is only the 
beginning of the exciting work to come in the months 
and years ahead. And 100 Resilient Cities’ partnership 
with the city is also just beginning. It is now that we 
can collectively begin implementing the actions and 
initiatives contained in the following pages, which 
will positively impact the lives of all of those who call 
Toyama home.

RESILIENTTOYAMAI. Executive Summary

Overview 

Toyama’s Resilience Vision

Toyama is recognized by the Japanese national 
government and by international organizations 
like 100 Resilient Cities, The World Bank, OECD 
and the United Nations as a leading model for city 
resilience. The stated goal of the Mayor is to make 
Toyama a truly resilient city for our citizens and to 
help others as they create their own resilience cities. 
The underlying lesson is that Toyama’s success 
is fundamentally not about policies, priorities or 
programs; it is about nurturing the resilient spirit 
of its citizens. For Toyama, resilience is a social 
journey begun long ago and directed toward future 
generations. We owe an immeasurable debt to our 
ancestors, rejoice in the resilient spirit of our citizens, 
and dedicate ourselves to secure opportunities for 
self-realization for all citizens and future generations.

We have created a long range Resilience Strategy by 
building on the policies Toyama has developed since 
its inception as the new city of Toyama in 2007, and 
drawing on the past and present resilient spirit of our 
people. This strategy was created with the invaluable 
help of the 100 Resilient Cities program, pioneered 
by the Rockefeller Foundation. 

This report details the background, challenges, 
development process, vision, aspirations and specific 
initiatives of our Resilience Strategy. In terms of 
policies, this report emphasizes certain policy areas 
such as the four areas specifically first recognized 
by The World Bank when Toyama became the first 
sub national government entity to sign an individual 
MOU Partnership with the Bank: Compact City 
Design, Waste Management, Flood Control, and the 
challenges of a rapidly Aging Population. But beyond 
specific policies, initiatives or mechanisms, this report 
will attempt to capture something of the communal 
spirit, social outlook, and management style which 
form the resilience backbone underlying the past, 
present, and any future success of those specific 
policies, initiatives or mechanisms in Toyama.

Located on the Japanese main island of Honshu and 
extending from the Sea of Japan to the crest of the 
Northern Japan Alps, Toyama is a thriving high tech 
city surrounded by and infused with nature.  Present 
day Toyama was created from the remarkably 
successful merger of 7 former municipalities with 
urban, suburban and rural populations. Deeply 
embedded in the city and citizens’ identity is both a 
deep, Japanese sense of nature’s sacredness and the 
centrality of agricultural and rural lands. Regarding 
the latter, our understanding of the importance 
of a robust relationship between rural and urban 
especially benefited from discussions with Ede Ijjasz-
Vasquez, Senior Director of the World Bank’s Social, 
Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice. 

With an ancient cultural and artistic heritage and 
deep interpersonal and community bonds, Toyama 
Vision 2050 emphasizes “Community, Nature and 
Innovation for the Future” and the critical balance 
of essential elements which must be maintained to 
nurture an enduring and resilient Toyama.

The Toyama vision is: 

to be a vibrant city of innovation and a tourism 
gateway, a model of resilience and environment-
friendly living, where strong community bonds help 
citizens flourish, and the high quality of an active 
lifestyle for all its residents achieves a harmonious 
balance between traditional arts and modern 
technology and between economic prosperity and 
the inspiring natural surroundings of the pristine 
Northern Japan Alps. 

How do we realize this vision? What are the 
constituent policies and actions we need? What 
challenges must be overcome?  What are the 
resources and best practices which will enable us to 
achieve our goals?

Environment

Essential Elements of Resilient Toyama

Viewed as a living organism, Resilient Toyama has four integral, 
organically connected elements in its city DNA, each with a 
subordinate vision, which create a logical structure for our 
comprehensive Resilience Strategy.

Resilient People

Resilient Infrastructure

The Toyama Vision for People is to continue to 
develop and promote a flourishing, mutually 
supportive community for all generations. Japanese 
culture has three interrelated ideas which are 
important for understanding this. In descending 
order of importance, one should first engage in jijyo, 
self help, then seek kyojyo, mutual help, and finally 
turn to kojyo, public help. For example, with our 
rapidly aging society we try to enable our seniors 
to live active, independent lives. They in turn can 
support younger people with families, who in turn 
support our seniors. This strengthens social bonds, 
enhances civic pride, and increases opportunities for 
self-realization regardless of age, gender or disability. 
This is Toyama’s social vision of self support and 
mutual support which will be passed on to the next 
generation. 

The Toyama Vision for Infrastructure is a sustainable 
infrastructure network connecting and enhancing 
urban, suburban and rural areas to support citizen 
self realization. The heart of Toyama’s infrastructure 
vision is the sustainable compact city which includes 
social as well as transportation infrastructures. 
This integrates disaster risk management into a 
labor and cost saving IT and ICT technology-driven 
infrastructure through public-private collaborations, 
radiating reciprocally from the central city 
throughout the regional hubs and agricultural and 
rural areas.  

Resilient Prosperity

Resilient Environment

The Toyama Vision for Prosperity is an 
entrepreneurial and flexible response to demographic 
change and the needs of every generation of citizens. 
While continuing to enhance its current strengths 
in the IT, pharmaceutical and manufacturing 
industries, Toyama’s innovative promotion of 
advanced technology industries such as aviation 
nanotechnology, robotics, and bio technology, 
creation of start-up incubators, and the infrastructure 
modifications and city promotion drive to grow the 
tourism industry, will attract industries, create jobs, 
engage young people, and provide opportunities for 
seniors who wish to continue working. 

The Toyama Vision for the Environment is a 
harmonious balance between human health, animal 
health and the health of Toyama’s bountiful nature. 
This comprises two aspects, each reflecting a 
different though complementary value and ethical 
stance: environmental management (human health) 
and environmental conservation (the health of 
nature and animals for their own sake). Working with 
international organizations like UNEP, NOWPAP, 
SEforALL, IUCN and IGES, Toyama will continue to 
vigorously support eco-friendly socio-economic 
practices, efficient waste management systems, 
green industries and long range conservation plans.

Toyama’s Resilience Challenge

Toyama’s major resilience challenges are generated primarily by 
demographic and geographic forces, as well as the inevitable 
forces of deterioration and aging.   

Even though it is blessed with rich supplies of food 
and water, social stability, an extraordinarily low 
crime rate, a negligible threat of terrorism, full 
employment, a diverse economy, the highest home 
ownership in Japan, temperate weather, and clean 
air and pure water, Toyama faces acute resilience 
challenges. Following the 100RC categorizations, 
these challenges can be divided into “shocks” and 
“stresses”:

services. Consequently economic resilience becomes 
another challenging stress. And the greatest shock 
the city faces is flooding. While more than 100 years 
of constructing sophisticated flood control systems 
has reduced the historic threat of catastrophic snow-
melt river flooding, the new threat of global warming 
has caused an increased frequency of torrential 
rain occurrences, overwhelming what were once 
adequate drainage systems.

A shock is a sudden, acute event that occurs 
infrequently, such as a major flood, earthquake or 
disease pandemic. A stress is a chronic condition 
that gradually weakens the city’s fabric on a daily or 
cyclical basis, such as high rates of unemployment, 
severe traffic congestion or social inequalities.   

Here is a snapshot of Toyama’s major stresses and 
shocks which are detailed in the body of this report.

The single greatest resilience challenge Toyama faces 
is the stress of Japan’s rapidly aging and declining 
population. The steep reduction in the percentage of 
wage earners as medical costs for the aged rapidly 
increase puts enormous pressure on the city’s budget 
and ability to maintain a high level of city social 

At the same time Toyama also faces the challenge 
of preserving the exceptional quality of its natural 
and human made assets. Environmental standards 
are high and the environment unusually clean, but 
diligence and evolving methods are required to 
maintain and improve the quality of the environment 
and the conservation of nature. Likewise, social 
cohesion and community bonds are strong but these 
wither without nourishment. And the multifaceted 
public transportation system is exemplary, but aging 
bridges, older rail lines, and new provisions for 
electric vehicles and bicycle sharing need constant 
attention.

Resilience Outlook

Throughout this process we developed a new 
perspective for the municipal government of seeing 
policies and planning through the lens of resilience.

This is reflected in the Resilience Strategy and rooted 
in the shared resilience vision flowing from the Mayor 
through the CRO and Office of Strategic Planning 
and Resilience and throughout the City Departments. 
While the Strategy has a large number of initiatives 

and sub initiatives, it is fundamentally flexible to 
account for new contingencies and new challenges.  
Most of all, though, the flexibility and resilience 
success of our Resilience Strategy does not depend 
on the refinements and complexities of systems, 
policies and initiatives, but on its organic foundation: 
the resilient spirit and community bonds of Toyama’s 
citizens which have overcome the great challenges of 
the past and will make possible a resilient future.

City Facts

Located 260 km (160 miles) from Tokyo on the Sea of Japan, 
Toyama sits on an alluvial plain at the base of the Northern 
Japan Alps, facing Korea, China and Russia. “Toyama ( 富山 )” 
means “rich with mountains” (“tomi ( 富 )” rich, “yama ( 山 )” 
mountains). Toyama stretches south from the historic shipping 
port of Iwase on the Japan Sea - home of Toyama’s prized 
premium seafood - to the historic mountain town of Yatsuo 
and the stunning 3000 meter (9840 feet) crest of the Northern 
Japan Alps, only 34 kilometers from the city center.

18

19

A thriving high tech city, Toyama is one of Japan’s 
leading ecological cities and serves as a gateway 
to the mountains where Japanese alpine climbing 
originated and the famed Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine 
trekking route begins. The mountains above Toyama 
frequently have the highest recorded snowfall in the 
world and Toyama’s famed snow-melt city water has 
won the Monde de Selection Grand Gold and Gold 
awards for taste and purity 6 consecutive times since 
2012.

From the 1200 meter deep, rich waters of Toyama 
Bay, 156 species of fish and shell fish are caught, 
making it one of the greatest fisheries in Japan. 
Toyama seafood is an integral part of “washoku”, 
the traditional Japanese cuisine, which UNESCO 
has designated one of the world’s cultural assets. In 
the washoku tradition of Japanese hospitality, the 
service is intimately personal, infinite care is taken in 
the preparation of the various dishes, and the final 
result is an artistic feast for all five senses. This is the 
essence of Japanese culture.

Modern Roots in Traditional Society

To comprehend the citizen vitality underlying the 
four elements of Toyama’s resilience DNA, we must 
look to the nexus of Toyama’s geology, location, 
history, and cultural traditions. Historically secluded 
by formidable mountain passes and difficult seas, 
and relatively protected from central government 
interference, Toyama was ideally placed to harbor 
new ideas, develop entrepreneurial attitudes, and 
evolve strong social bonds – all vital attributes 
grounding its citizen’s resilience.  

One of the three sacred mountains of Japan, Mt. 
Tateyama, rises directly behind the city and attracted 
religious pilgrims for 800 years from all over Japan.  
In the feudal period the castle town of Toyama was 
strategically important, located on the trade routes 
along the Japan Sea, and dominated the rich rice 
fields of the Toyama Plain. Even Basho, the founder 

of haiku poetry, visited the region on his trip to the 
“deep north”.  

In 1690 the feudal lord of Toyama, Masatoshi Maeda, 
used a medicinal preparation from Toyama to cure 
the chronic stomach pain of a powerful central 
government lord in Edo Castle (present day Tokyo).  
The story of the cure spread and requests came in 
from all over Japan for medicine. Toyama became 
known as “The City of Medicine” and Toyama’s 
medicine peddlers delivered medicine all over 
Japan, becoming the basis of Toyama’s modern 
pharmaceutical industry and eventually its glass 
art community after glass was first used to hold 
medicines. The entrepreneurial spirit, resilience in the 
face of extreme conditions, and the strong cultural 
bonds, developed during these earlier periods have 
served the people of Toyama well. 

The old port town of Iwase has carefully preserved 
19th century wooden buildings, recalling its past on 
the sea routes from Hokkaido to southern Japan and 

China when Kitamaebune, the traditional stout cargo 
ship of the 17th - 19th centuries, carried Japan’s 
commerce on the northern seas.

With its wooden structures preserved today, the 
beautiful hill town of Yatsuo was once a thriving 
center of silk production and Japanese papermaking, 
and the 300 year old Harvest Wind Festival in Yatsuo 
is one of the most famous festivals in Japan.

Toyama Castle, built in 1543, was surrounded by inner 
and outer moats on three sides with the Jinzu River 
on the fourth, enclosing a large area of 2.5 square 
km (1 square mile). Renowned as the Castle which 
“floated on water”, after 1581 it was the keep of the 
powerful samurai Narimasa Sassa. In 1585 Hideyoshi 
Toyotomi, the great samurai lord of western Japan, 
attacked the castle with 100,000 troops and 
destroyed it. In the 1600’s, Lord Masatoshi Maeda 
rebuilt the castle and his family ruled here until 1870.   

Modern and Traditional come together at the new 
civic pride slogan “Amazing Toyama”, with the 
castle in the background and international Resilient 

Cities Summit guests flanked by city staff in samurai 
costume.

Toyama in World War II

Municipal Consolidation

With abundant water from the Northern Japan 
Alps, the area’s massive production of hydroelectric 
power supported the development of heavy industry.  
Producing specialized steel and ball bearings, 
Toyama became the most totally bombed Japanese 
city in World War II. After being used as a practice 
target for four huge “pumpkin bombs” as a rehearsal 
for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 
99% of city center was destroyed on the night of 
August 1, 1945 in a massive incendiary raid by 173 
B-29 bombers, many marked with a “T” for Toyama.  
More than 110,000 people were directly affected, 
8,000 were injured and 2,700 lost their lives.

Recovering from the war, the resilient spirit of 
the people of Toyama is evinced in the fortitude, 
gratefulness, and uncomplaining attitude expressed 
in the city’s World War II Peace Reconstruction 
Memorial erected on August 1, 1974. At the center is 
a statue of a Tennyo, or Buddhist celestial maiden, 
commemorating the hard work, great sacrifices, and 
enduring resilience of those citizens who created 
today’s vibrant city from the ashes of war. Wreathed 
in traditional ribbon-like scarves, the Tennyo stands 
on the celestial clouds holding an open red lotus 
flower in the left hand to symbolize compassion and 
purity of heart and, with a young child, lifts up a 
prayer for world peace.

This is an enduring emblem of a people’s individual 
and communal resilience which made it possible 
to achieve the sense of common purpose and 
dedication to create the advanced transportation 
system, economic prosperity, and clean environment 
of this formerly devastated city.

Another indication of how resilient communal bonds 
have served to produce results for the greater good 
is the remarkable municipal consolidation in 2005. To 
reduce costs, increase efficiency and transfer more 
administrative control to the local level, the national 
government of Japan instituted a program to 
encourage municipalities to merge, especially in rural 
areas. On April 1, 2005, seven municipalities (Toyama 
City, Osawano Town, Oyama Town, Yatsuo Town, 
Fuchu Town, Yamada Village and Hosoiri Village) 
were able to successfully merge into a greater 
Toyama City. The mayor of the former Toyama City, 
Masashi Mori, was elected the first mayor of the new 
Toyama City on April 24, 2005. 

This consolidation of the original seven municipalities 
vastly increased the scope of responsibility for the 
administration of the new city. For example, the 
largest of the former municipalities, Toyama City, 
comprised 209 square kilometers and a population 
of 320,374, while the new consolidated Toyama City 
had a 30% higher population of 418,000 but covered 
1242 km2, an area 5 times larger than the largest of 
the pre-consolidation municipalities. This presents 
both a management challenge and an opportunity 
for government efficiency, financial savings and 
greater resilience.  But most importantly, this 
successful process of consolidation produced even 
more resilient social bonds to meet Toyama’s future 
challenges.

RESILIENTTOYAMAII. Resilient Toyama

Solutions to Shocks and Stresses

Aging and Declining Population 

Toyama has identified four shocks and five stresses 
as the most challenging issues facing the city: 

Key Shocks

Flooding

Land slides

Earthquakes

Key Stresses

Potential 

infrastructure 

failure 

The most significant stress or shock Toyama 
currently faces is an aging and declining population 
which reflects the population decline of Japan, 
predicted to be approximately 19% over the next 30 
years. The proportion of Toyama’s population over 
65 already exceeds 26% and is expected to increase 
to 38% within 30 years.  These demographics cause 
critical stresses for social, financial and infrastructure 
systems, and directly affect multiple policy areas, 
including disaster response. An example of this 
cross-sector stress is the sharp decline in daily bus 
ridership, from 40,000 to 16,600 between 1995 and 
2012. This was mostly due to elderly citizens going 
out less frequently and finding traditional bus lines 
more difficult to negotiate. The aging population 
also means increased healthcare costs. In our rapidly 
aging society, nursing care costs increased by 23% 
from 2008-2012. Also, the number of elderly people 
living alone has increased, which can leave them 
more isolated and, if they do not maintain active 
lifestyles, decrease their overall health and increase 
the city’s healthcare costs.

Some of Toyama’s innovative solutions for an aging 
population deal directly with health and welfare 
issues, though they are fundamentally connected 
with solutions to other shocks and stresses. Two 
examples are the Kadakowa Preventative Care Center 
and the Comprehensive Care Center.

includes the multitude of challenges facing the 
city.  Toyama has a long history of developing 
innovative solutions to shocks and stresses. 
Here we will focus on some of our shocks and 
stresses together with Toyama’s successful 
solutions in the four areas of expertise which 
the World Bank identified when Toyama 

became the first World Bank Partnership 
City in November, 2016: aging population, 
flood control and management, compact 
city transportation systems, and waste 
management.  Other shocks and stresses 
such as potential infrastructure failure and 
insufficient education for citizen self-realization 
will be addressed below within the Initiatives 
and Sub Initiatives of our comprehensive 
Resilience Strategy.

The Kadokawa Preventative Care Center is the first 
of its kind in Japan using natural hot spring water 
for Aquakinetics, and Physical and Hyperthermia 
Therapy. It is a public-private partnership, built on 

the re purposed site of an elementary school using 
private donations and city funds, and managed by a 
private company. An on-site medical staff assesses 
appropriate therapy for each individual.  

RESILIENTTOYAMAFirst Compact City Pillar

The key to the Compact City Plan is revitalizing 
public transportation. This not only produces 
efficiency, increases convenience for everyone, and 
reduces CO2, as the map above indicates, the senior 
population is clustered along the rail transportation 
corridors so these policies are highly beneficial for 
seniors. 

Revitalizing public transport has four stages: 

1. A new LRT line (Portram) from the city center to 

the ocean front

2. A new loop line (Centram) in the city center
3. Integrating the LRT lines with the new bullet train 

(Shinkansen) from Tokyo 

4. Connecting the LRT lines to the local tram lines. 

Because the central downtown Japan Railways 
Station lies at the center of a radiating rail network, 
by integrating the new 25 km LRT network into the 
rail network we have the opportunity to create a 
pedestrian-friendly city where citizens do not have to 
rely on cars. 

Revitalizing Public Transport - 
Japan’s First LRT Network

Beginning with Japan’s first complete LRT network, 
our goal is to create a city where every amenity is 
within public transport and/or walking distance.

The Portram and Centram lines are PPPs where 
the city provided public funds for renovating/
constructing the lines and private companies run 
the service.  Our Light Rail System uses barrier 
free stations, ultra low access cars and on-board 
attendants to aid the elderly. We instituted a 100 
yen (90 US cents) public transportation “going out 
ticket” for the elderly, 24% of whom now have this 
ticket while 2,600 use it daily. The Portram line 
ridership has increased over two times on weekdays 
and over three times on weekends and the Centram 
line, completed in 2009, has seen a dramatic 
increase of 61% in elderly passengers. 

The east-west aligned central train station was 
elevated so that the Shinkansen comes in on the 
third floor, local trains are below on the second 
floor, and the trams can pass under the station on 
a north-south axis. In our Resilience Strategy we 
are addressing the last element of connecting the 
north and south tram lines, integrating the LRT into 
the city’s complete rail/bus/tram/bicycle sharing 
network. 

II. Resilient Toyama

The Comprehensive Care Center, completed in March 
2017, is dedicated to care for seniors and for young 
and handicapped children, and also provides daycare 
for working mothers with newborns. A public-private 
partnership in the heart of downtown Toyama, it 
consists of a medical center, culinary school and café 
devoted to healthy medicinal foods, a convenience 
store and pharmacy, a public gymnasium and 

privately owned sports club, and a nursing school 
administered jointly by the city and a private 
company. It provides comprehensive support for a 
healthy and active lifestyle, helps reinvigorate the 
downtown area and provides in-home doctor visits 
and coordination of seniors’ medical and nursing 
care. The Care Center was built on the re purposed 
site of a former elementary school.

Compact City Strategy

Urban Development Serving the Elderly

Toyama’s compact city strategy, announced in 2007, 
addresses multiple challenges including the needs 
of our aging society, and its successful policies 
have now been incorporated into Toyama’s 30 year 
Resilience Strategy. The Compact City Strategy has 
three pillars: 

1. Revitalizing public transportation
2. Encouraging both residents and business to 

relocate to zones along public transport lines and 
building city facilities along these lines.

3. Revitalizing the city center

Second Compact City Pillar

Third Compact City Pillar 

Compact City Results

The second pillar of the compact city plan is 
encouraging both residents and business to relocate 
to zones along public transport lines and building city 
facilities along these lines. This policy is illustrated in 
the graphic below.

Another key to our compact city strategy is 
revitalizing the city center. Because the city 
government has been consistent in carrying out our 
compact city strategy, this has encouraged private 
investment and many new commercial and residential 
buildings have been built in the core area. Especially 
notable is the new Toyama Glass Art Museum 
designed by the renowned Japanese architect Kengo 
Kuma. Built with the financial support of Toyama’s 
business community and national redevelopment 
funds, and a culmination of Toyama’s history as the 
“City of Glass” with the largest glass art community 
in Japan, it anchors the downtown area, enriches 
citizen lives, engenders self realization through the 
arts, and attracts national and international visitors.  

As the graphs 1 and 2 show, the number of people 
moving into the city center, and the number of 
people moving into the residence encouragement 
zones along the public transport lines, has 
steadily increased and there are strong long range 
projections. Even though the total population of the 
city will have decreased by about 7.5% in the 20 year 
period between 2005 and 2025, as chart 3 shows the 
percentage of the city population living in the city 
center will have increased from 28% in 2005, when 
the plan was first established, to about 42% in 2025.

In the Toyama vision, compact does not mean that 
everything is concentrated in the city center. Instead 
the emphasis is on encouraging residents and 
business to locate along the transportation lines. This 
encompasses hub areas which were once centers of 
smaller cities that consolidated into the new Toyama.  
Hence, transportation and many city services are 
efficiently combined and compact, but all areas of 
the city - urban, suburban and rural - are served. And 
the rural to urban citizen’s resultant sense of equal 
entitlement has become the underlying model for 
Toyama’s resilience approach: careful planning and 
wide stakeholder engagement.

RESILIENTTOYAMAII. Resilient Toyama

Flooding 

With the exception of the devastating bombing of 
the city during World War II, the greatest shock the 
city has faced is the threat of flooding. Two Class A 
rivers, the Jinzu and Jōganji, flow precipitously down 
from the mountains directly through the center of 
Toyama to the Japan Sea on the north, producing the 
wide Toyama Plain of loose volcanic debris. The land 
is subject to the constant threat of floods and rapid 
erosion. In 1858 the magnitude 7 Hietsu Earthquake 
caused the largest landslide in recorded history when 
a 700m high section of Mt Tombi collapsed into the 
Jōganji River above Toyama. Filling rapidly with melt 
water from heavy snows, within two months the huge 
landslide dam broke twice, generating devastating 
floods of debris laden water. In 1969 torrential 
rainfall caused massive flooding, killing many people, 
devastating homes, collapsing bridges, and isolating 
villages. 

As early as 1906, now famous Sabo erosion control 
projects were launched to prevent landslides in the 
Mt. Tateyama Caldera and debris laden floods on 
the Jōganji River into Toyama. 260 erosion control 
facilities have been built, including the highest and 
the largest sabo dams in Japan. Between 1901-
1920 Toyama completed a second large project 
to straighten a major bend of Jinzu River in the 
downtown. 

More recently, climate change has raised a new threat 
of urban flooding. A greatly increased incidence of 
torrential rain, which can reach 100mm per hour, 
has started to overwhelm the once adequate urban 
drainage system for downtown streets.

Neighborhood Disaster 
Prevention Associations

After the Great East Japan Earthquake, Toyama sent 
300 disaster relief professionals to the Sendai area 
and housed refugees. This experience led the city to 
restudy its disaster risk management and voluntary 
Neighborhood Disaster Prevention Associations were 
developed. These Associations are composed of local 
groups of neighbors who have a natural tendency 
to look out after each other. By March 2014 the city 
had already successfully trained 385 Associations. 
These Associations are key elements in the city’s 
ability to convey critical information about disaster 
response and to successfully implement emergency 
plans during disasters by helping citizens follow 
official evacuation routes and by watching over 
the young, infirm and elderly. These Associations 
embody the strong social bonds and a high degree 
of volunteerism which is an essential characteristic of 
the resilience of Toyama’s citizens.

Toyama citizens are proud of their scrupulous 
attention to waste, reflecting the Japanese adage 
“mottainai” or “don’t waste”, with its Buddhist roots 
conveyed with a sense of regret concerning waste.  If 
you go to a beach in Toyama, there are no trash cans 
but the beach is spotless. Executives of high rises will 
come into the street once a year to clean the area 
around their building and neighborhood associations 
have a regularly scheduled routine of each neighbor 
cleaning storm drains around their own house. 

On the municipal scale, one important city waste 
management project is Eco-Town, a city supported 
industrial park housing waste-to-useable-product 
companies. The Eco-Town program was founded 
by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry 
and the Ministry of the Environment and Toyama  
established its Eco-Town in 2002, the first approved 
in the Hokuriku region and the 16th in the nation. The 
goal is to advance city planning in harmony with the 
environment while promoting the local region as part 
of a “Zero Emission” initiative that aims at ensuring 
that waste discharged from one industry is reused as 
a raw material for other sectors. 

Waste Recycling – Eco-town 

With city incentives, seven different companies 
now turn “waste” into usable products at the Eco-
Town Industrial Park, started in 2002. An extensive 
waste recycling education center increases citizen 
awareness of the methods and importance of waste 
recycling.

In 2008 the National Government of Japan 
designated Toyama an “Environmental Model 
City” and then in 2011 designated Toyama an 
“Environmental Future City”. This was followed by a 
series of international recognitions and international 
cooperative agreements in resilience knowledge 
sharing, which also saw Toyama selected to host the 
G7 Environmental Ministers’ Meetings in 2016.

Since the 2011 East Japan Earthquake, the City 
has sponsored 765 disaster awareness lectures 
by disaster experts, fire department staff, and by 
Neighborhood Disaster Prevention Associations. The 
Associations have then carried out 712 drills. Directly 
involving these voluntary groups in the city’s disaster 
relief strategies heightens citizen’s awareness, builds 
a framework for disaster preparedness, and develops 
strong communal bonds for securing the safety of 
the elderly and most vulnerable.

100RC Journey

Toyama began its resilience planning journey with 100RC 
in April 2015 when the Office of Strategic Planning 
and Resilience was created to oversee the planning, 
development and implementation of the Resilience 
Strategy. In July 2015 Dr. Joseph Runzo-Inada was 
appointed as Toyama’s CRO, reporting directly to the 
Mayor and heading the Office of Strategic Planning and 
Resilience. These are the milestones on our resilience

RESILIENTTOYAMAIII. A New Strategy

Throughout this process, 100RC has been an 
invaluable partner. The Resilience Framework 
helped our city staff and citizens achieve a more 
comprehensive understanding of resilience and 
a more precise understanding of which issues 
Toyama was better at addressing and what areas 
needed improvement. We were also able to assess 
the importance of Toyama’s unique attributes in 
resilience planning. 

For example, Toyama’s natural setting is more similar 
to cities in the 100RC system like Vancouver and 
Wellington than to mega urban centers. With 1242 sq 
km of land from a seacoast to a mountain range, 2 
major and 8 minor rivers and 70% forested land, and 

against the background of the Japanese sense of the 
sacredness of nature, our resilience strategy has a 
strong emphasis on both environmental management 
and on conservation, which have different ethical 
motivations. The former is primarily concerned with 
what is best for humans while the latter focuses 
on valuing animals and nature for their own sake. 
Moreover, the present Toyama City was formed 
under a national reorganization plan for formerly 
separate cities with the intent of incorporating rural 
areas so that the whole is officially the “city”. Hence 
Toyama’s Resilience Strategy addresses and balances 
urban, suburban and rural needs and interests and 
every system – transportation, water etc – is treated 
holistically as one integrated whole.

Defining Resilience

One of the most crucial questions is “What is 
Resilience”? 100RC identifies seven qualities of a 
resilient city:

Reflective: Reflective systems are accepting of the 
inherent and ever-increasing uncertainty and change 
in today’s world. 

Robust: Robust systems include well-conceived, 
constructed and managed physical assets. 

Redundant: Redundancy refers to spare capacity 
purposely created within systems so that they can 
accommodate disruption. 

Flexible: Flexibility implies that systems can 
change, evolve and adapt in response to changing 
circumstances. 

Resourceful: Resourcefulness implies that people 
and institutions are able to rapidly find different ways 
to achieve their goals or meet their needs during a 
shock or when under stress. 

Inclusive: Inclusion emphasizes the need for broad 
consultation and engagement of communities, 
including the most vulnerable groups. 

Integrated: Integration and alignment between 
city systems promotes consistency in decision-
making and ensures that all investments are mutually 
supportive to a common outcome.

During our resilience planning process, and 
particularly our 2016 Resilient Cities Summit session 
with the World Bank, OECD, UN Habitat and Dr. 
Adrian Healy of Cardiff University on the topic “What 
is resilience?”, we found that the seven qualities 
are helpful and necessary criteria but not sufficient 
criteria of resilience on Toyama’s model.  

The seven resilience qualities are relatively 
quantifiable, a useful feature. For Toyama, some of 
the qualities which make the city resilient are not 
quantifiable. With its agricultural milieu and Japanese 
cultural setting, Toyama sees itself in organic terms. 
As CRO Runzo-Inada noted in the Dassault Systems 
Compass, the 3D Experience magazine article 
“Uniting for Resilience”, on Toyama’s model resilient 
cities are like resilient people and a suggestive 

parallel would be to resilience vis-à-vis athletes. 
Two athletes might have the same “measurables” 
but one performs at a consistently outstanding 
level and the other does not. What is the underlying 
difference? With athletes we sometimes talk about 
“heart”, that immeasurable something extra of the 
successful athlete. Likewise for Toyama, it is essential 
that the city maintain strong civic pride (“Amazing 
Toyama”), exceptional community bonds, and a deep 
and abiding commitment among our citizens to self 
realization of oneself and of others (a Confucian 
ideal) – qualities of “heart” which are not fully 
measurable. 

The pragmatic effect of these immeasurable qualities 
of “heart” help explain how the most bombed city in 
Japan in World War II could recover to become the 
vibrant modern city of Toyama; how seven former 
cities could peacefully merge into one Toyama; how 
urban dwellers do not look down on rural dwellers as 
“peripheral”; and how doors are often left unlocked, 
streets and public places are meticulously cleaned, 
and this major city still has volunteer firemen to 
complement the professional firefighters. They are 
also foundational for the consensus management 
style, unusually strong working relationship the city 
government has with the business community, our 
wide stakeholder involvement, and our drive for a 
long range city plan which supports all segments of 
society and all regions of the city and foregrounds 
the deep relationship between the city and the 
natural environment. Perhaps one word which best 
sums up the essential centrality of relationships to 
people and nature in Toyama is the Japanese phrase 
"itadakimasu", said traditionally before eating to 
give thanks to every being which made one’s meal 
possible: the fish, the fisherman, the farmer, the cook 
and the server. 

Consequently, the initiatives in our Resilience 
Strategy incorporate the high degree of mutual 
support and volunteerism inherent in the citizen’s self 
understanding and emphasis the arts as a means of 
self realization. (We owe CRO Sara Toy special thanks 
for sharing her insightful views on the importance of 
the transformative value of art to civic life in Bristol’s 
resilience understanding.)

RESILIENTTOYAMAIII. A New Strategy

Toyama’s Resilience Strategy 
Development Process

Organizational Structure

Toyama’s Resilience Strategy draws on a rich and 
diverse array of stakeholders and sources, including 
the city’s already extensive municipal planning. A key 
document is the new 10-year plan required by the 
National Government and just completed in March 
2017. Working with 100RC and our city resilience 
consultant team from PwC Advisory, we created

1.  A distinguished Resilience Advisory Committee of 
prominent CEOs and Presidents from the business 
community, Presidents of NGOs and Director 
Generals of key city government Departments, and 

2. Four Working Groups to generate new initiatives 

for our elements of People, Infrastructure, 
Prosperity and Environment, with a cross section 
of members of the business community, NGOs, 
municipal government leadership, and citizens. 

The results of these discussions were added to 
that of the Mayor’s separate Task Forces (e.g. on 
Working Women), advice from the Mayor’s Policy 
Advisers, wide ranging discussions with citizens and 
city experts, and the city’s various 3-year, 5-year 
and 10-year plans, such as the Urban Development 
Comprehensive/Compact City Plan.

CRO

The Organizational Structure of our Strategy 
development has six key components: 

1.  A direct relationship between the CRO and 

the Mayor which is supported by the Office of 
Strategic Planning and Resilience (SPR) which in 
turn is directly linked to pivotal city departments.

2. A Resilience Advisory Committee of prominent 
stakeholders to advise the CRO, SPR and Mayor 
throughout the process.

3. Working Groups of diverse stakeholders to 

research and develop initiatives. 

4.  A consensus vetting process overseen by the 

CRO and SPR Director which flows from the 
city advisors and accumulated research then 
through the Resilience Advisory Committee, city 
Department Director Generals, city Executive 
Committee and Mayor. 

5. Final presentation by the SPR Director of the 

Resilience Strategy to the City Assembly, which 
will be overseeing the city budget during the 
implementation of initiatives.

6. The understanding of all parties in this process 
that genuine and effective city resilience plans 
depends on all city policies working cross-silo 
and in concert toward the one goal of a long-term 
comprehensive resilience.

This process ensures that diverse stakeholders are 
already invested in the Resilience Strategy by the 
time it is launched.

Resilience Strategy 

City Resilience Framework 

Structure of Toyama’s 
Resilience Strategy 

Our Resilience Strategy was created to both address 
the shocks and stresses facing Toyama and nourish 
the foundational resilient spirit of Toyama’s citizens 
through comprehensive, integrated and long 
term resilience planning. The basic format for our 
Resilience Strategy is based on the City Resilience 
Framework (CRF) developed by The Rockefeller 
Foundation and Arup, which is also Toyama’s official 
100RC Strategic Partner. 

The 100RC understanding of urban resilience driving 
the CRF is:

The capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within a city 
to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of 
chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.

The CRF helped us assess Toyama’s resilience 
strengths, weaknesses and opportunities through 
the four main dimensions and 12 drivers of the CRF 
which help indicate what makes a city resilient. As 
the 100RC analysis points out, genuine resilience 
involves the capacity to not only overcome stresses 
and shocks but to learn from those experiences 
to be better prepared to deal with future shocks 
and stresses.  This is a paramount goal of Toyama’s 
Resilience Strategy, extended, as noted above, to 
our constituent rural and agriculture areas, and 
comprehensively directed toward sustaining and 
fostering the resilient spirit of our citizens.

Putting the CRF together with our Resilience Vision, 
the Mayor’s leadership and compact city vision, 
and Toyama’s unique perspective on resilience, we 
developed Guiding Principles for developing our 
resilience initiatives:

•  Creating a model resilient city
•  Developing a comprehensive 30 year plan for 

resilience with step by step progressions

•  Focus on four interrelated elements: Resilient 

People, Resilient Infrastructure, Resilient Prosperity 
and Resilient Environment

•  Emphasis on self realization for citizens
•  Wide stakeholder engagement
•  Specific plans for the urban suburban and rural/
agricultural areas which are mutually integrated

•  Integrated/cross silo communication and 

cooperation

•  Efficient, with the resilience dividend of multiple 

results from each project 

•  Flexible time line
•  Maximum utilization of public-private partnerships 

and cutting edge technologies

We then developed four subsidiary Visions for the 
four integral and connected elements in the city 
DNA. These four subsidiary Visions, together with 
the city Resilience Vision and the Guiding Principles 
set the parameters for our comprehensive Resilience 
Strategy.

RESILIENTTOYAMAIII. A New Strategy

Resilience Structure

People

Infrastructure

Prosperity

Environment

The Toyama Vision for People is a flourishing, 
mutually supportive community for all generations. 
As we support our seniors to live active lives, they 
can support younger people with families, while 
we encourage youth to support our seniors. This 
strengthens social bonds, enhances civic pride, and 
increases opportunities for self-realization regardless 
of age, gender or disability, a Toyama vision of 
mutual support which will be passed on to the next 
generation.

The Toyama Vision for Infrastructure is a resilient 
network connecting urban, suburban and rural 
areas. The heart of Toyama's vision is the sustainable 
compact city which includes social infrastructures, 
and integrates disaster risk management into a labor 
and cost saving technology-driven infrastructure 
through public-private collaborations, radiating from 
the central city throughout the regional hubs and 
agricultural and rural areas.

The Toyama Vision for Prosperity is an 
entrepreneurial and flexible response to demographic 
change and the needs of every generation of 
citizens. While continuing to enhance Toyama's 
current strengths in the IT, pharmaceutical and 
manufacturing industries, Toyama's innovative 
promotion of advanced technology industries 
such as aviation nano-technology, robotics, bio 
technology, and its infrastructure modifications and 
city promotion drive to increase tourism, will attract 
industries, create jobs, and engage young people.

The Toyama Vision for the Environment is a 
harmonious balance between human health, animal 
health and the health of Toyama's bountiful nature. 
Working with organizations like UNEP, NOWPAP, 
SEforALL, IUCN and IGES, Toyama will continue to 
vigorously support eco-friendly socio-economic 
practices, efficient waste management systems, 
green industries and longrange conservation plans.

Inspiration from peer cities : Peta Jakarta, Jakarta

The city of Jakarta is prone to severe annual 
flooding, causing significant damage and 
disruption. During periods of extreme weather, 
up-to-date and accurate information is critical in 
order to inform disaster response efforts. 

In 2014 the Jakarta provincial government 
launched its Smart City Platform which 
includes a flood map, called PetaJakarta, an 
issue reporting app, called Qlue, and a traffic 
management tool, called Waze . 

PetaJakarta.org  was developed by Jakarta 
Emergency Management Agency (BPBD DKI), 
and is an online map which improves disaster 
response at a city scale by providing citizens 
and government departments with live data 
on flood levels across the entire city.  The 
map combines data from a variety of sources, 
including:

•  river gauge measurements, 
•  sensor data, 
•  citizen reporting, and 
•  social media. 

Making use of Jakarta’s high concentration of 
Twitter users, the system automatically interacts 
with users whose tweets contain the word 
“flood” (“banjir”), asking them to confirm their 
destination and the current status of the flood. 
It answers questions that are vital to public and 
emergency services, such as ‘There’s flooding 
nearby, should I collect my kids from school 
early?’ and ‘Which neighborhoods are currently 
worst affected by flood waters?’ 

The system allows for a far greater reach 
and speed of data collection and information 
dissemination. The map and its data are shared 
amongst government agencies, NGOs and 
residents, helping to enable joined-up and 
improved decision-making, and speeding up 
disaster response times. Once waters levels 
have receded, the data can also be used to help 
prepare for and mitigate future flooding . The 
system is seen as a successful and low cost 
application of open data principles that could 
help other cities improve their disaster response 
systems and overall resilience to extreme 
weather events.

Inspiration from peer cities : 
Gastronomy tourism, Donostia-San Sebastián 

San Sebastián, Spain, has built a reputation 
for being a destination for food tourists. The 
city is only the 27th largest in Spain but has 
the second highest number of Michelin starred 
restaurants per inhabitant in the world (behind 
Kyoto, Japan).

The Basque Culinary Center (BCC), located 
in the center of San Sebastián, aims to ensure 
the continuity of cuisine as a center for 
innovation for the future, by providing expert 
training, promoting research and knowledge 
transfer between haute cuisine professionals 
and businesses. It plays an active part and a 
leadership role among the tourism offerings 
of San Sebastián, aimed not just at culinary 
professionals but a more general audience of 
food lovers.

The food capital brand is maintained through 
the various events held in the city. The World 
Tourism Organization (UNWTO) holds a World 
Forum on Gastronomy Tourism, started in 
2015, in San Sebastián and will return to the 

city every two years. Therefore the third World 
Forum of Gastronomic Tourism, in 2017, will 
return to San Sebastián co-organised by the 
Basque Culinary Center. The city also hosts an 
annual event of an international gastronomy 
congress, called San Sebastián Gastronómika. 
This is the biggest event of its kind where the 
world’s most celebrated chefs perform. The 
International Seminar on Local Public Policies 
for Food Sovereignty  was held in San Sebastián 
in 2016. This was an opportunity to debate and 
promote public processes which provide food 
sovereignty. The annual San Sebastián Film 
Festival holds ‘Culinary Zinema’, partnered with 
BCC, where top international chefs prepare a 
menu based on the films screened that day.

Gastronomic tourism can help the development 
of local economies, preserve local tradition, 
create jobs and improve other sectors. It 
is most effective when it is collaborative, 
where everyone involved has one view on the 
gastronomic brand.

RESILIENTTOYAMAIV. Initiatives

Inspiration from peer cities : One Tree Per Child, Bristol 

The ‘One Tree Per Child’ project was launched 
in Australia, but Bristol was the first city in the 
world to roll out the One Tree Per Child initiative, 
which began in February 2015. 

The initiative had a primary target of planting 
36,000 trees by April 2016. This target was met, 
and exceeded, by the target date with 39,000 
trees planted. The city council supported 
the schools by providing a plot for them to 
undertake planting if they have no spare land . 
Bristol City Council also covered the costs of the 
following: 

•  Tree seedlings, 
•  Existing council staff to assist with the school 

plantings (including roles like community 
liaison officers, tree officers and parks and 
roads maintenance staff), and

•  Council staff to talk about the ‘One Tree Per 

Child’ project and the importance of trees.

 ‘One Tree Per Child’ is part of Bristol City 
Council’s tree plan. Children are being 
encouraged to play an active role in doubling 
the city’s tree cover . Local tree planting 

organisations, native nurseries, horticultural 
volunteers and community groups have also 
been involved in the project. 

This initiative was set up by Bristol’s previous 
Mayor, George Ferguson, who said the scheme 
was “a great way for school children to connect 
to the environment and their local community. 
As a child’s tree grows, their commitment to the 
environment and their local community grows 
as well.  ”

This initiative has continued with the current 
Mayor, Marvin Rees, committing to continue the 
scheme by planting 24,000 trees in schools, 
parks and open spaces across Bristol in the next 
four years . Rees has described the scheme as 
“an amazing opportunity to develop lasting 
change in environmental education, wellbeing 
and community engagement. ”

The initiative is replicable across the world, with 
the programme now starting to plant trees in 
Australia, the Netherlands, Kenya, Ghana, Mali 
and South Sudan. Tree plantings are also set to 
begin in Jamaica and the USA .

Inspiration from Peer Cities - Pittsburgh

Supporting aging Pittsburghers and those with 
disabilities The City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny 
County, and a number of local non-profits and 
foundations offer services for Pittsburghers 
with disabilities. As the population in the region 
continues to age and demands for services 
increase, a number of ongoing and new efforts 
aim to meet the needs of these populations, 
including offering healthy living opportunities, 
enabling mobility, promoting workforce 
development, enhancing home and community-
based care, meeting basic needs, providing 
access to supportive housing, and other 
objectives.

Pittsburgh’s long-standing traditions of social 
connectivity and civic engagement as well as 
its wealth of non-profit institutions enables a 
wide variety of opportunities for Pittsburghers 
to get engaged in making the city a better 
place. The resilience strategy presents an 
opportunity to expand the scope of activities, 
many coordinated through the city’s ServePGH 
program, that aim to address resilience-related 
issues through impact volunteerism, including 
protecting the urban forest, cleaning up blighted 
neighborhoods, or assisting Pittsburgh’s elderly 
or disabled populations.

RESILIENTTOYAMAV.  Implementation 
  and future resilience 
  delivery structures

With the release of Toyama’s Resilience Strategy, we 
will continue implementation of initiatives currently 
underway – such as our environmental education 
programs and compact city strategy - ensuring that 
their resilience value is maximized. We will also begin 
implementation of new resilience initiatives. We will 
develop an implementation plan for the first year 
with specific actions and outcomes. 

We have already established resilience planning 
structures which will also be essential to successful 
implementation. The principal structures include:

•  Continuity of the Mayor - reelected to a new four 

year term in April 2017

•  Continuity of the position of Chief Resilience 

Officer directly under the Mayor - term of service 
aligns with the Mayor’s

•  Firmly established and budgeted Office of Strategic 

Planning and Resilience (currently 11 members) 
under the CRO, with civil service staff reporting 
to the Director General of Administration and 
Planning

•  Establishment of a Resilience Advisory Committee 

model comprised of city administrative staff, 
business leaders, and NGO representatives 

•  Structure for Working Groups comprised of 

city administrative staff, business leaders, NGO 
representatives, city policy advisers and Platform 
Partner representatives

Working closely with the Mayor and the Director 
Generals of the city’s departments, the CRO and 
SPR will provide a coordinating role to support the 
implementation of resilience initiatives and sub-

initiatives by the relevant departmental teams. The 
CRO and SPR will be able to leverage resources to 
support the departments’ work, such as the 100RC 
network and Platform Partners, and the World Bank 
and its Partner and Client cities. The SPR will work 
with city departments to monitor the progress of 
initiatives and sub-initiatives as they are carried out, 
and offer additional resilience support as needed in 
view of each department’s progress.     

The CRO and SPR will also oversee the Working 
Groups, which will be organized in specific resilience 
policy delivery areas in consultation with the relevant 
city departments and divisions. The Working Groups 
will offer advice to ensure our resilience initiatives 
and sub initiatives bring together the best knowledge 
and innovation in each area. Current plans are to 
establish new Working Groups for the following 
Initiatives:

•  Initiative 1 Comprehensive Smart City (planning 

already underway)

•  Initiative 7 Business Investment 

Additional Working Groups may also be established 
for:

•  Initiative 3 Water/Waste/Energy Management 
•  Initiative 8 Tourism 
•  Initiative 10 Conservation & Environmental 

Education. 

Progress with implementing the resilience strategy 
will be monitored in part by making use of the key 
performance indicators for each sub-initiative. 
Progress will be reported on a yearly basis, allowing 
us to take stock of our successes, review new 
opportunities, and articulate our next actions.

More than 200 actions, including more than 50 key plans of 
Toyama City, were compiled in the City Resilience Actions 
Inventory, which demonstrates how the actions the City is 
taking are contributing to resilience. The most important 
plans for the development of a city resilience strategy are 
summarised below.

Toyama City Comprehensive Plan (2007-2016 & 
2017-2026)

Like many of cities in Japan, the operation of Toyama 
City is based on a Comprehensive Plan which consists 
of a ten-year policy concept, a five-year basic plan, 
and a one-year implementation plan. In the current 
Comprehensive Plan, five objectives, 19 policies, 62 
programmes are designed and 157 key projects are 
budgeted as Comprehensive Plan Projects. (The 
2012-16 Basic Plan).

The five objectives are summarized as Safety, 
Security, City environment with nature, Economic 
vitality, and Partnership. These are responding to 12 
key issues. 

The 1st Comprehensive Plan issued in 2007 will be 
completed in March 2017. The Provisional Policy 
Concept for the 2nd Comprehensive Plan starting 
FY2017 was released in 2016 for public comment and 
will be issued as a five-year Basic Plan this year. 

In the 2nd Comprehensive Plan, four objectives – 
human asset and secured lives, city and environment, 
vitality and wider linkage, and partnership and 
connectivity, are proposed. The issue of city resilience 
is mainly situated in the “city and environment” 
section but also related to all other objectives. 

country, coping with the declining and aging 
population. Each local government is required to 
develop a plan based on the strategy.

Toyama City published a population vision to 2060 
and the city strategy in 2015. As a basic policy to 
implement the priority programmes and project 
in 5 years, it laid out four objectives in relation to 
employment creation, incoming population, quality 
of life for all generations, and compact city. 

Toyama City Regional Disaster Prevention Plan 
(2006, 2016)

A Regional Disaster Prevention Plan is developed 
by a local government, according to the Disaster 
Countermeasures Basic Law. Toyama City drew up 
the plan in 2006 and updated it in 2016, following 
the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake. The Plan 
describes counter measures, including  prevention, 
preparation, emergency response, and recovery. The 
countermeasures are categorized into three types 
of disasters; i.e., wind and flood, snow and severe 
accidents, earthquake and tsunami. The recent 
update enforced in particular the sections related 
to tsunami. The plan also includes a set of related 
materials including hazard map, organizational 
network, reporting line, and list of disaster control 
headquarters and shelter facilities. 

Toyama City Urban Master Plan (2008) 

Toyama City Regional Resilience Plan (2017-2021)

Under the Urban Planning Law, Toyama City 
developed a Urban Master Plan in 2008. The Master 
Plan is built upon the Comprehensive Plan and the 
Urban Land Use Masterplan, and looks about 20 
years ahead. 

This plan envisions the Compact City development 
that aims to control the suburban sprawl and 
revitalise the downtown, promoting the use of public 
transportation. 

The Masterplan includes basic policies for land use, 
transport, urban infrastructure and public facilities. 
The development plans for fourteen districts are also 
included.

Toyama City Population Vision (2015) and Toyama 
City Comprehensive Strategy for City, People and 
Work (2015-2019) 

In 2013, the national government initiated a “Regional 
Revitalisation Strategy” as a part of growth strategy 
that aims to recover  earning power across the 

A Regional Resilience Plan has been developed by 
each local government, according to the Basic Act 
for National Resilience (2013). Toyama City Plan 
was released in March 2017.  The planning process 
of the Resilience Plan of Japan follows a unique 
framework designed by the central government. Four 
objectives, and 45 types of incidents that should 
be prevented are established; then, a vulnerability 
assessment is carried out with 12 policy areas and 
3 cross-cutting areas. A 5-year plan is produced 
based on the assessment and reviewed every 5 
years. The hazards are any kind of natural hazards 
and accidents, hazards such as nuclear plant failure, 
are not included. The national government placed 
the National Resilience Plan as a top layer plan 
which umbrellas various plans, including the Disaster 
Prevention Plan and National Land Use Plan.

especially targeting buildings- and reduce the

RESILIENTTOYAMAToyama City Eco-Model City Action Plan 
(2009-2013 &2014-2018）

 Global warming has been increasing and Strong 
measures are required these days. In order to 
change the nation into a “the low-carbon society” 
and exercise leadership in international society, the 
national government selected “Eco-Model Cities” 
which have made progressive efforts with high 
goals to realize a low-carbon society including a 
large reduction in greenhouse gas. Toyama City was 
selected as “Future City” in 2008 and developed 
“Toyama City Eco-Model Action Plan” in 2009. Since 
2014, the city has developed and implemented “the 
Second Action Plan” based on the plan for the past 
5 years. The plan mentions the long-term goal of 
reducing greenhouse gas by 2050, the medium-term 
goal by 2030, the principles for achieving this, the 
specific projects, the prospect for the reduction of 
the greenhouse gas, follow-up measures to grasp the 
progress of the whole plan and the periodic emission 
situation, and so on.

budgeted pressure for the city.  562 building assets 
with a total floor area of 1.6 million m2 were listed 
and the cost for maintenance and replacement was 
estimated. The necessity of cost-reduction was well 
recognized and, referring to the current and future 
demand for such facilities, approaches for elimination 
and consolidation were proposed.

Based on this report, the city is currently preparing a 
“Public Asset management plan (2015 － 16). The plan 
aimed to optimize the all city-owned building assets 
and reduce the budgeted pressure for the city. Detail 
investigation and analysis are carried out and the 
solution is discussed, engaging the citizens. 

Report on the study for social asset investment for 
realization of a compact city (2017-2056)

This study analyzed the current situation and issues 
of key city assets; i.e., roads, bridges, parks, and 
water supply and sewage, and proposed basic policy 
for future capital investment and management costs 
for aging infrastructure, aiming at sustainable social 
asset management that aligns with the compact city 
policy.

Based on this proposal, further actions are designed. 
Some are implemented under the Infrastructure 
Long-life Plan, a national initiative of the MLIT. 
Currently the city is developing an asset management 
plan for bridges, which are aging and urgently 
require efficient and effective countermeasures.

The study confirmed major challenges for the city 
to maintain the quality and the current volume of 
the existing assets with limited city budget. Also the 
study confirmed the necessity of integrating various 
objectives of cross-cutting policies, such as transport 
policy, industry, welfare, and disaster preventions, 
which is not fully incorporated in the urban master 
plan. 

Toyama City Basic Environment Plan 
(2007-2016&2017-2026)

The Basic Environmental Plan of Toyama aims to 
secure a good environment for the next generation 
through 1) showing common recognition for future 
image of the environment in the city, 2) revealing the 
direction to implement the policy comprehensively 
and strategically, and 3) guiding citizens, business 
promoters, the city and tourists to facilitate 
participation and action. Planned period of this plan 
is 10 years from 2017 to 2026 (the second phase 
plan). In the second phase plan from 2017, Toyama 
City set the following six goals. The theme is "Toyama 
has full of vitality and appeal which is created from 
the environment".

1. Natural Symbiosis
2. Low Carbon
3. Resource Recycling
4. Compact City Planning
5. Improving the Value of the Environment, Society, 

and the Economy

6. Collaboration and Human Resource Development

The second phase of the plan is based on the idea of 
SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) adopted at 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit 
2015.

Toyama City Future City Plan 
(2012-2016&2017-2021)

The “Future City” Conception is part of the “21 
National Strategy Project” positioned in National 
New Growth Strategy the Cabinet decided in 2010. 
The national government selects a few cities and 
areas as “Future City” and creates techniques 
for coping with the environment and the super-
aging and outstanding successful cases in urban 
development. The government develops these at 
home and abroad. This aims at increasing demand, 
creating jobs, and ultimately realizing the sustainable 
economic and social structure of the nation. Toyama 
city was selected as a “Future City” in October 2011. 
The plan aims at promoting “a Concentrated type of 
Compact City planning through the Renovation of 
Public Transport” further and realizing a vigorous city 
where anyone wants to live by introducing renewable 
energy utilizing the geographic characteristics and 
promoting new industry utilizing the traditional 
pharmaceutical industry and so on. In order to 
implement the projects in the plan efficiently and 
continuously, the city has established a “Toyama City 
Future City Advisory Group”, and a “Toyama City 
Future City Promoting Conference” composed of 
industry, academia, public sector, and Toyama city. 
Each project teams composed of companies and 
research institutions etc., and promoted the project 
with engagement of various stakeholders. At the end 
of FY 2016, the second phase plan was formulated.

Toyama City Energy Efficiency Accelerator Plan 
(2015-2019）

In view of Toyama City’s achievements in working 
as a  Future City” and “Eco-Model City” and the 
fact that improvement in energy efficiency can be 
expected in the future, the city was selected as 
an “Energy Efficiency Accelerator City” in United 
Nation’s SEforALL（Sustainable Energy for All).

The Toyama City Energy Efficiency Accelerator Plan 
contains measures aiming at improving the energy 
efficiency accelerator pace in order to achieve the 
goal SEforALL established.
