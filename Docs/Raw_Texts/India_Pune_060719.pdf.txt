PUNE 
RESILIENCE
STRATEGY

MUKTA TILAK
Hon. Mayor of Pune

Pune, one of the most progressive cities in India, has played a significant role in 
pioneering urban planning. It is known for its active citizen participation in the 
city’s growth. The city has transformed over the years, from an education hub 
to an auto industries hub, and now an IT hub. This has resulted in migration, 
increase in population and expansion of city limits. In the future, the city is 
expected to expand further with addition of 23 surrounding villages and will 
probably become the largest city of Maharashtra in terms of size.

Like other Indian cities, Pune faces many challenges such as uncontrolled 
growth, continuous migration, pressure on urban environment, institutional 
complexity, etc. The city administration tries to resolve these issues with the use 
of technology, capital works, internal resources, and the organization’s internal 
capabilities. Sustainability and resilience are two key concepts that need to be 
built in for holistic development. The 100 Resilient Cities Network is supporting 
Pune city in building resilience.

It is an honour for Pune city to become part of the global 100 cities under 100 
Resilient Cities (100RC), pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, selected 
through a stringent process and filtering numerous applications received from 
cities worldwide. This is one more step for Pune city to become a global city 
and an opportunity to guide other Indian cities to follow in its footsteps.

The resilience strategy process should focus on three key areas considering 
the current pattern of development and the future growth of the city. 
These three areas are – need for improvement in urban mobility, focus on 
urban environment including water body management, and preservation of 
biodiversity; and identify ways to improve employment opportunities and skills 
especially in the informal sector. The informal sector plays a very important role 
in the city’s overall economy and will be given access to various services in an 
affordable manner.

Citizen involvement is very crucial in the resilience building process in these 
areas. The strategy should emphasize on citizen engagement and developing 
Information Education and Communication strategies to effectively implement 
various actions. This will help in achieving the city’s vision of citizens involved 
and supported resilient growth.

SAURABH RAO, IAS 
Pune Municipal Commissioner

One of the finest cities in Maharashtra, Pune has witnessed significant rapid 
growth over the last decade. Pune City envisions becoming one of the most 
liveable cities in India by solving core infrastructure issues in a ‘future-proof’ 
manner, and by making neighbourhoods clean, green, and beautiful

The character of the city transformed over the decades with its economic, 
demographic and social development. The ‘Oxford of the East’, ‘Cultural Capital 
of Maharashtra’, ‘Auto Hub’, ‘IT hub’ and now ‘Smart City’ has the potential to 
become ‘Model Resilient City’ of India.

To achieve this, it is important to integrate and mainstream the Resilience-
building into city services, plans, and initiatives. Thus, the partnership with 
100 Resilient Cities (100RC), pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, has 
happened at an opportune time. In this partnership, Pune Municipal Corporation 
(PMC) has shown its commitment by appointing Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) 
and setting up CRO’s office to steer the strategy formulation process.

Fundamental to 100RC’s philosophy on resilience is preparing cities for disasters 
but also, working with different socio-economic groups and a wide range of 
stakeholders to prepare for economic, social, and physical stresses and shocks. 
Now we have completed the Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA) Report 
and are moving ahead to Phase 2 of Strategy formulation. The scale and depth 
of stakeholder engagement that has gone into the PRA is very enriching.

The key Discovery Areas identified under PRA are a clear reflection of the 
challenges that lay ahead of the city and the need for future strategies to drive 
aligned actions and reforms. The CRO’s office has got excellent support from 
the PMC, other government agencies, and local ecosystem including civic 
agencies, NGOs, individual experts and educational/research organizations 
during the PRA stage. This has helped in coming out with a comprehensive and 
detailed PRA document.

In Phase 2, the CRO’s team will deep dive into three Discovery Areas through 
extensive consultations with various stakeholders and assessment of the city’s 
needs. PMC will ensure its full support to the CRO’s team in Phase 2.

Pune is slowly becoming a global hub by attracting and collaborating with many 
international agencies including foundations, donor agencies, and industry 
bodies, thus bringing in the best know-how to the city and facilitating them to 
set up pilot projects.

The Resilience Strategy will not only guide Pune city in streamlining and 
strengthening its plans and actions but also help in strengthening its position 
as a global hub. Pune has potential to become a Lighthouse City in resilience 
building in India and can encourage other cities to follow it.

MICHAEL BERKOWITZ
President, 100 Resilient Cities

On behalf of the 100 Resilient Cities organization, I’d like to offer my sincerest 
congratulations to the City of Pune, Municipal Commissioner, Mr. Saurabh Rao, 
I.A.S, Joint Secretary MoHUA and Former Municipal Commissioner, Mr. Kunal 
Kumar, I.A.S, Honorable Mayor of Pune, Ms. Mukta Tilak, and Chief Resilience Officer 
Mahesh Harhare on the release of the city’s first ever urban Resilience Strategy.  

This strategy takes a clear-eyed look at Pune’s most pressing and complex 
challenges, including uncontrolled growth, inward migration, un- and under-
employment among youth, and a degraded urban environment. Pune has a 
reputation as the ‘Oxford of the East’ and it has long built upon its academic 
tradition to ensure prosperity. But even Pune – with academia built into its 
foundations, with access to a young, well-educated talent pool, with a favourable 
reputation for business and industry – even Pune must adapt and innovate to 
ensure its growth doesn’t get the better of it and to ensure its future is as  
illustrious as its past.  

With a focus on Growth, Economy and the Environment, this strategy seeks to 
draw on all of Pune’s resources to transform the city into a green, equitable and 
livable city for every resident. Two projects in particular highlight this ambition. 
First, Pune participated in the Resilience Accelerator program in partnership with 
Columbia University; consulting with every environmental group in the city to 
design an alternative vision for the Mula-Mutha River. This vision will ensure that 
the river once again serves the city not only as a source of clean water but also 
as a gathering space and green refuge from the heat of the city. Second, Pune’s 
work on its innovative Pune Skills World project, which will show the city where its 
strengths and weakness are and will serve as a roadmap for ensuring that every 
citizen is valued for his or her contribution to Pune’s economy. 

What sets this strategy apart from other plans the city has compiled is the level 
of community and stakeholder engagement undertaken to develop meaningful 
solutions. Pune’s CRO Mahesh Harhare and his team worked tirelessly to act 
as a bridge between local government, citizen forums, civil society, NGOs, and 
industry to ensure that every voice is represented in Pune’s resilience building 
efforts. It is this dialogue that will give this strategy a successful start and it is only 
by continuing to work openly and collaboratively that these actions will come to 
life. As Pune takes on this challenging work, I encourage you all to continue to 
collaborate to build a more resilient Pune.

MAHESH HARHARE 
Pune Chief Resilience Officer (CRO)

Physical, economic and social challenges have become an integral part of 
urbanization. Cities are grappling with shocks such as flooding, droughts among 
others, and stresses like traffic chaos, water shortage, pollution of water bodies, 
etc. The 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation 
identifies these shocks and stresses as critical challenges and aims to make 
cities more resilient. The 100RC will provide support to 100 select cities across 
the world, including Pune, to develop a holistic Resilience Strategy that reflects 
each city’s distinct needs. Further, the 100RC platform will provide opportunities 
for Pune to connect with its global peers to share knowledge and best practices.

Pune has a unique position in Maharashtra due to its cultural heritage, 
educational progress, and industrial development. Availability of skilled work 
force, entrepreneurship, and abundance of water sources are major drivers for 
the development of the city. Pune city is known for its development-focused 
initiatives and reform-oriented approach to serve citizens better.

However, increasing population, rapid peri urban growth, and the expansion 
of city limits are creating complex challenges. There is no single solution 
to address these growing issues. There is a need for strengthening the 
sustainability concept and building resilience aspects in policies, plans, and 
actions. Therefore, the Resilience Strategy process, supported by 100RC, will 
be an important activity for Pune city to do a self-examination of its plans and 
assimilate the resilience concept.

Resilience building is a continuous process and needs people involvement. 
The Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA) work, which was carried 
out in Phase 1, involved extensive consultations with different experts and 
scanned through various plans and programs of the city. The Phase 2 work 
of strategy preparation will try to achieve this through promotion of people 
engagement. The strategy does not involve merely adaptive measures, but also 
transformative actions, for both the short and long term.

Pune city is becoming more global. The kind of interest that is being developed 
in international agencies and institutes for collaboration with Pune to explore, 
share, and create pilot projects is remarkable. This partnership with 100RC gives 
a platform to Pune to demonstrate its capabilities and explore potential for 
scaling new heights at a global level. As the CRO, my role is to focus on these 
aspects, deliver a holistic Resilience Strategy for Pune, and further support the 
city in implementation of pilot projects.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCITY CONTEXTRESILIENCE DIAGNOSISRESILIENCE STRATEGYIMPLEMENTING RESILIENCERESILIENT PUNERapid urbanization in Pune has meant that structural 
inequalities and systemic vulnerabilities of individuals, 
institutions, ecosystems, and city development processes 
have surfaced; necessitating strategic engagement to make 
city-systems more resilient.

With the motivation to address these challenges, Pune was 
selected in 2016 to join the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) 
Network, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. 
Fundamental to 100RC’s philosophy on resilience is not only 
preparing cities for disasters but also, working with different 
socio-economic groups and a wide range of stakeholders to 
prepare for economic, social, and physical stresses and shocks. 

According to 100RC, “resilience is 
the capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, 
businesses, and systems within a 
city to survive, adapt, and grow no 
matter what kind of chronic stresses 
and acute shocks they experience.”

Challenges within a city are framed as shocks and stresses

ACUTE SHOCKS are sudden, sharp events that threaten a city
CHRONIC STRESSES weaken the fabric of a city on a day-to-
day or cyclical basis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCITY CONTEXTRESILIENCE DIAGNOSISRESILIENCE STRATEGYIMPLEMENTING RESILIENCERESILIENT PUNEPune holds significant historical 
importance in India...
The city’s role as the historical capital of the Maratha Confederacy during its opposition 
to Mughal rule, it contributions in the struggle against the British Raj during India’s 
independence movement, and its place as the locus of many socio-cultural reform 
movements, has made it an important political and cultural center.

...It is also one of the most important urban 
economies in the country
The city’s growth is driven by a variety of factors including a knowledge economy, diverse 
economic engines of auto, manufacturing, IT and IT enabled services (ITES), a fertile 
hinterland, proximity to Mumbai & the western coastline, and a legacy of cooperatives in 
Maharashtra. Well positioned to lead the economic revolution in India, vulnerabilities of the 
unorganized sector, and evolving skilling needs, demand focus.

From a group of fishing villages on the Mula-Mutha River, 
Pune rose to political significance under the Marathas in the 
18th century; and retained its importance as a major military 
base under the British.

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Pune became one of 
the centers for political unrest against the British rule and 
a hub for social movements, moving the needle on societal 
progress in the nation.

Led by Chattrapati (King) Shivaji “Maharaj”, what began 
as a resistance movement against the Mughals, became a 
powerful empire that dominated much of the Indian sub-
continent under Peshwa (Prime Minister) Baji Rao I, with Pune 
as the seat of its power. The regional economy, based on a 
closed agrarian and Balutedari system (artisans), frequently 
disturbed by famines, diseases and wars. Pune was not 
located on any major trade route and it rose to prominence 
primarily as a political-military center under the Marathas. 

After their decline 1818, the new British rulers retained 
the city as one of their major military bases in the sub-
continent. In order to meet the need to create a new class 
of local individuals to support in the administration of the 
region, the British introduced the modern education system 
training government employees, lawyers, doctors and other 
professionals from the traditional, often high caste, ‘literati’ 
that already had been serving the administrative apparatus of 
the pre-British rulers. Introduction of electric train lines and 
telegraphic communication, and proximity to Bombay (now 
Mumbai), which had become a major port under the British, 
provided significant logistical benefits to Pune, and placed it 
at an advantage from an economic and military standpoint. 

Leading figures of the freedom struggle leveraged the 
printing press to start a local-language newspaper that 
became the spokes-piece for the Indian national freedom 
movement. The ‘swadeshi movement’, an economic strategy 
boycotting British products and promoting the revival of 
domestic products and production processes, also started 
in Pune. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, founded to mediate 
between the Indian government and its people, is the 
forerunner of the Indian National Congress. The INC went on 
to become a major force against British rule and became the 
first ruling party of Independent India. 

Prominent leaders and thinkers came forward to set up 
educational institutions for natives in Pune, like the Deccan 
Education Society and Fergusson College. Education was 
inclusive of gender and caste, a pioneering move at the time. 
Pune saw the rise of crucial civil society organizations for 
women’s rights & education and socio-religious reforms. The 
first caste-linked national level affirmative action, the Poona 
Pact, signed between Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Babasaheb 
Ambedkar, marked the beginning of the movement against 
untouchability within the larger freedom struggle against  
the British. 

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN PUNE REGION

Post-independence, with the state government’s targeted 
industrial development policies, Pune and its surrounding 
areas, including the twin city of Pimpri-Chinchwad, gained 
economic importance.

class infrastructure, exemption of taxes, and flexible labor 
regulations. Infrastructure investments like the Mumbai-
Pune Expressway, a new international airport for the Pune 
Metropolitan Region (PMR), entry of global banks, etc. also 
contributed to the region’s growth.

EDUCATION ECOSYSTEM
Many academic institutions not only produce talent but 
are also employment centers themselves. In addition, such 
institutions drive economic activity through their large 
student population. 

Pune has 9 universities and over 100 higher education 
facilities that generate significant employment in the city. 
It has also been found that the housing demand around 
universities is usually high due to the student population in 
the area, which also creates a market for restaurants and 
other commercial activities. Thus, universities have a major 
spillover effect on the local economy of Pune and the PMC 
benefits from the property tax gains from private academic 
institutions and housing/commercial developments. 

result in potentially significant job losses in the IT services 
sector as well. Evolving technological trends present 
challenges for companies to remain competitive in the 
future driven by (a) the need to upgrade the organizations 
capabilities, in part by re-skilling/up-skilling to take on the 
jobs of the future, and (b) the requirement to handle potential 
automation in the value chains of sectors. The strategies 
utilized by the high-skilled sectors in Pune will have a 
significant impact on the city’s economic resilience. 

Up-skilling and re-skilling of low-skilled workers, including 
migrant workers from outside Pune, is seen as essential to 
provide a pathway for improved livelihoods. 

Rural migrants from within Maharashtra, especially from 
drought affected agricultural areas, have been migrating 
to Pune for jobs in its growing industrial sectors, to avail 
quality service delivery (e.g. in education, water supply), 
and for spillover benefits of proximity to the commercial 
capital - Mumbai. While Pune has a strong base of educational 
institutions, there are a relatively limited number of programs 
targeted at poor people, resulting in limited opportunities for 
informal workers to join formal work spaces. There are several 
initiatives, which, if scaled up, could provide much required 

EMPLOYMENT AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT

Drivers like automation and artificial intelligence are 
expected to increase demand for high-skilled employment, 
and create new economic opportunities; however, pressure 
on medium/low-skilled jobs will increase and enhance focus 
on re-skilling & diversification.

Pune now has the 7th highest GDP among cities in India (USD 
69 bn), as ranked by the Brookings Institute (2014). Jobs 
offered by the knowledge economy in the area have attracted 
and retained a highly skilled and young workforce (as per 
census 2011, 30% of the workforce holds graduate degrees 
and 33% of the city’s population is below 30 years of age).

skilling solutions, e.g. private sector & philanthropy initiatives 
like Tech Mahindra’s Skills for Market Training program, 
and city supported programs like Pune City Connect are 
conducting skill training and job readiness programs for low 
skilled individuals.

Underlying vulnerabilities of low-income groups continue to 
demand focus as they limit the upward mobility expected 
from skilling.

Informal, daily wage workers with poor incomes are forced 
to move into informal housing due to limited low-income 
housing supply. Limited asset ownership (~30% of households 
live in slums without tenure), limited penetration of capacity 
enhancing/sustaining products and services like health 
insurance, combined with an uncertain legal environment 
(e.g. the risk of eviction and confiscation of goods for 
street vendors) lead to cycles of poverty for many (10.9% 
households holding below-poverty-line ration cards as 
of 20081). This may limit upward mobility of low-income 
populations even if skilling programs were to be implemented. 
Thus, efforts to improve the economic well-being of such 
individuals need to go hand-in-hand with improvements in 
access to basic services including low-income housing and 
government schemes for urban poverty alleviation. 

Informal workers in certain sectors in Pune and farmers in 
the peri-urban areas have self-organized leading to some 
redistribution of wealth and greater negotiating power for 
these groups.  

A number of organizations have emerged among the low-
income residents of Pune and its peri-urban areas. For 
example, building on the legacy of the well-developed co-
operative movement in Maharashtra and taking advantage 
of Pune’s rapid growth, farmers in adjacent areas have 
voluntarily pooled their land to form co-operatives and 
have attracted IT companies to setup integrated townships 
with offices, housing, and amenities, including schools. This 
has allowed farmers to transition into urban livelihoods and 
build community wealth. Benefits of co-operation are also 
being seen among the urban poor. For example, SWaCH 
Pune Seva Sahakari Sanstha, a waste picker cooperative has 
succeeded in improving work conditions and livelihoods for 
the marginalized community

PUNE LIGHTHOUSES

Lighthouse is a flagship project of the Pune City Connect (PCC), an 
industry-led corporate social responsibility (CSR) platform working in 
partnership with the PMC. Under PCC’s Sustainable Livelihoods program, 
Lighthouse centers located close to slum communities (aimed at one 
per ward) provide the underprivileged youth of Pune with the chance 
to enhance their skills based on individual interests and connect them 
to meaningful career opportunities. A successful example of the private 
sector and local government working together, the Lighthouse provides a 
blueprint for Resilient Pune initiatives.  

SPOTLIGHT
SWaCH MODEL 

The wholly worker-owned SWaCH cooperative - born in 2007 to provide 
front end waste management services to the city of Pune and recover user 
fees, entered into a formal memorandum of understanding with PMC for 
door to door collection of waste in 2008. SWaCH is the success story of 
how thousands of waste pickers in Pune, India came together to get first 
and rightful access to recyclable waste. 

Private contracts to Waste management companies threatened the 
livelihood of waste pickers who depend on recyclable waste (paper, metal, 
plastic, and glass) to sell and make a living. The cooperative is the direct 
result of the advocacy of KKPKP (established in 1993). The Cooperative has 
3000 members (and growing) who are engaged in door step collection of 
waste in Pune who are KKPKP members or their family members. Members 
are not paid by municipality for this work but collect user fee for door step 
collection from citizens with sale of scrap is their other source of income. 
The Corporation saves approx. Rs.12 crores each year in this model.

However, Pune’s infrastructure and spatial 
growth have been largely unplanned
The rapid rate of urbanization in Pune has not been accompanied by planned infrastructure 
development and service expansion causing significant stresses such as traffic congestion, 
lack of affordable and secure housing, and poor service delivery, especially in peri-urban areas

SPATIAL GROWTH
Different politico-economic growth trajectories in Pune’s 
history have manifested in four distinct urban spatial patterns 
in the Pune metro region, each faced with distinct challenges. 

Dense historic core: The seventeen ‘peths’ (neighborhoods) 
of the old city, dotted with heritage structures, grew over 150 
years between the 17th and 19th centuries under the Maratha 
and Peshwa rules. With distinct ethnic identity, specialized 
trade and artisans, commercial activities in the peths have 
continued to date attracting heavy vehicular traffic in its 
narrow lanes. Poor traffic management has caused severe 
congestion and reduction in air quality here. The city core is 
also the densest part of the city today where Bhavani Peth 
and Kasba Vishrambagh Wards have densities of 661 and 
445 persons/Ha2, much above the national norms of 125-175 
persons/Ha. 

Spacious military cantonments: By the early 19th century, 
cantonments were set up outside this core to accommodate 
British military troops and over time military officers and 
civilians set up sprawling bungalows, schools, colleges and 
hospitals. Cantonment Boards, which incorporate both elected 
representatives and members of the military, govern these 
low-density areas with wide avenues. 

Serviced industrial developments: Post-independence in 1947, 
large land tracts around Pune were acquired and serviced 
with roads, and water supply for industrial development, 
under the umbrella of the Maharashtra Industrial Development 
Corporation (MIDC). These areas did not mandate residential 
and commercial development until 2015, because of which 
squatter settlements for migrant laborers sprung up around 
MIDC lands, along riverbanks, railway lines, and on hill slopes. 
Many middle and high-income employees commute daily from 
Pune to these industries on the outskirts with implications on 
traffic commute time and air pollution levels. 

Unplanned fringe developments: By the mid-90s, large IT/
ITES hubs and educational institutions were developed on 
lands converted from agricultural use, in the fringe areas of 

Pune. Private developments meet the consequent housing 
demands for professionals and students in this rapidly 
urbanizing zone. Many of these developments face with water 
shortages since they fall under the jurisdictions of village 
panchayats, and are therefore not connected to city water 
supply and sewerage systems. 

Pune City area of 250.56 sq km (in 2013) went upto 331.56 
sq km when 11 fringe villages were included within the city 
limits, in 2017. After merging of remaining 23 villages, the PMC 
jurisdiction area is likely to go upto 465 sq km. This will make 
PMC the largest corporation in Maharashtra compared to BMC 
with an area of 413 sq. km. Increase in land area together with 
a projected 37%3 decal growth in population raises concerns 
about the city’s capacity to provide services and guide growth.

Housing supply and access have not kept pace with 
economic growth and demographic demands of the city,

As per Census 2011, 22% of the city’s population lives in 
informal settlements with variable security of tenure and 
limited coverage of basic services. In the city core, median 
home prices have gone up by 50% over the past decade 
(median home price in Shivaji Nagar increased from approx. 
INR 5,500/sq. ft to 11,000/sq. ft). Housing developments have 
therefore moved to PCMC and fringe areas of the city, closer 
to employment centres. This reflects in Census 2011, which 
indicates 22.7% decadal population growth in Pune versus 
70% in adjacent Pimpri-Chinchwad. 
As per a Cushman Wakefield report projecting housing  
demand-supply between years 2016-2020, low-income 
groups drive nearly 75% of the demand in Pune but only 4% 
of the supply; with majority of the upcoming supply directed 
towards the middle-income group. The major barriers to 
private developer led affordable housing are availability of 
low cost developed land as well as government approval 
processes, in addition to the lack of access to credit for the 
low-income group.

2018, “while there are good reasons for encouraging home 
ownership, it must be recognized that the rental market is 
also an important part of the urban eco-system. Unclear 
property rights and difficulties with contract enforcement 
have constrained the market in India in recent decades. These 
problems need to be resolved in order to allow horizontal 
and vertical mobility as well as to address a related issue 
– high vacancy rates.” According to the Survey, Pune has 
between 20-25% of the total residential census houses lying 
vacant compared to about 15% in Greater Mumbai, Delhi, and 
Bengaluru. This can be explained by outside investors buying 
real estate in the city for capital appreciation versus income

PMPML operates the public bus service, with PMC and PCMC 
sharing 60% and 40% cost, respectively. For years, PMPML 
has faced operations and maintenance challenges because 
of insufficient funds for upkeep, limited parking, inefficient 
route design due to limited data-driven planning, and poor 
traffic management systems. Nevertheless, the city has been 
making improvements in the bus-system especially with the

Department within PMC to oversee development. Street 
improvements of major traffic roads with reduced parking 
spaces, increased sidewalk widths, addition of bio-swales, 
trees, and furniture have increased foot traffic. This increase 
pedestrian activity is expected to improve revenues for 
businesses along the street and make them safer. These 
succeses for Pune are a testament to the close collaboration 
between the PMC and civil society organizations that have 
been championing for safe and inclusive mobility in the city. 

However, integration between different modes of mobility 
and with land-use planning remain to be fully explored. 

Pune lacks a unified mobility agenda for the city. Different 
agencies look after different modes, for example PMPML is in-
charge of bus-transit, PMC will undertake the implementation 
of the new cycle plan, MAHA METRO overlooks metro 
and different local, and state agencies are responsible for 
construction of roads and bridges. Often these agencies have 
conflicting mandates and there is no convening authority 
that coordinates the different initiatives under one common 
mobility vision. This has led to sub-optimal and often, 
conflicting efforts and outcomes.

What makes issues more complex is that land-use planning is  
not well coordinated with transportation. Thus large 
developments are undertaken without much regard for transit 
routes and vice-versa. This has led to further reliance on 
private cars over the years, increasing traffic congestion and 
commute times.

Wider housing policies seem to have focused on 
construction of new units, and have not taken a holistic 
approach to housing.

The Kundu Committee Report released in 2012 concluded that 
increasing housing stock do not necessarily lead to reductions 
in housing shortages. The supply demand mismatch, especially 
in low-income housing segment shows the inability of the 
current market mechanisms to meet the gap. Civil society 
organizations in Pune, with support of PMC, have taken an 
approach of incremental improvement and upgradation 
of slums, which have the advantage of using existing land 
footprints and can be done at a fraction of the cost.

Easy access to finance for private vehicles, convenience

dependence on private vehicles, especially two wheelers. The 
city has among the highest two-wheeler registration rates in 
India – out of the 3 mn vehicles registered in Pune in October 
2015, 75% were two-wheelers. Limited availability of reliable 
and quality transit has also increased dependency on ride-
sharing providers like UBER and OLA, in the middle and high-
income segments.

PUBLIC BICYCLE SHARE, PUNE CYCLE PLAN

A component of the Pune Cycle Plan, the Public Bicycle Share is a public 
transportation option for short trips in Pune, with the goal to increase 
bicycle mode share in the city from 8% to 25% by 2030.

Brightly coloured for visibility, the durable, dock-less bicycles eliminate the 
cost of setting up, operating, and maintaining docking stations. Bicycles 
work on QR codes and e-payments. The capital expenditure is borne by the 
Pune Municipal Corporation and the operations and maintenance is done by 
a private vendor with revenue generated from advertisements, promotions, 
registration charges, and user fees.  

SPOTLIGHT
RAINBOW BRTS

Bus Rapid Transport System in the twin cities of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad 
provides dedicated bus corridors along with buses, bus stations, terminals, 
and an intelligent transit management system, for safe, fast, affordable, 
and efficient public transit. The system is operated by the Pune Mahanagar 
Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and the infrastructure has been 
developed by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and Pimpri-Chinchwad 
Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Of the total proposed 113-km length across 
both cities, 68.8 km has been approved for Pune with financial support of INR 
1014 Crores (USD 152 million) from Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal
Mission (JnNURM) of the Government of India. A BRTS cell has been set up in 
PMPML for inter-agency coordination.

Additionally, the city’s ecology and environment 
are severely stressed and degrading
Pune is rich in natural resources with 35% of its land area under green cover. This 
provides significant natural diversity in a relatively small area, comprised of hills, wooded 
forests, rivers, lakes, and parks. The interacting effects of increasing population density, 
industrialization and urbanization, and poor environmental management practices are 
causing significant degradation of Pune’s environment 

Situated in close proximity to one of the most biodiverse 
regions of India, the Western Ghats, Pune is rich in  
natural assets.

At a height of 560 m above Mean Sea Level (MSL), the city 
is characterized by vast stretches of undulating plains inter 
spread by low and medium ranges of hills. As per the land-use 
distribution of Pune city, the total land area covered under 
hills and hill slopes is 5.1%. The rivers of Mula and Mutha, 
which originate in the Western Ghats, meet in the city to 
eventually drain into the Bay of Bengal. There are three major 
lakes in Pune - Pashan (62.6 ha), Katraj upper (7.2 ha), and 
Katraj lower or Rajiv Gandhi Zoo (18.6 ha). The city is also 
surrounded by dams - the Khadakwasla, Panshet, Warasgaon 
and Temghar, that provide water to the city.

Upstream settlements with limited basic sanitation services, 
several rapidly urbanizing fringe areas outside the jurisdiction 
of the PMC, and areas within city limits that are not connected 
to the sewer system release untreated sewage, industrial 
effluents, and agricultural run-off into the rivers and lakes. 
With PMC’s sewage treatment plants working at limited 
efficiency, only 71% of the total generated sewerage in the city 
is treated while the remaining 29% is released into the rivers 
untreated (PMC-ESR Report 2017).

In addition, municipal solid waste generation in Pune is among 
the highest in Indian cities at 1600-1700 tons/day. Challenges 
such as inadequate coverage in door-to-door solid waste 
collection (54% household coverage in 2016), inefficiencies 
in waste processing, and suboptimal citizen behaviour has 
caused dumping of solid waste in the water bodies. 

This has led to high levels of both BOD (Biochemical Oxygen 
Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) in the water 
bodies, causing many native aquatic species to go extinct and 
nuisance species to thrive, resulting in an increase in the cost 
burden on the city. Water pollution has also increased the 
risk of water-borne diseases, like dengue and malaria, and has 
increased the pollution of ground water resources. 

The city is undertaking the Mula-Mutha Pollution Abatement 
project to augment and increase the number of sewage

Encroachments along the water bodies and channeling have 
disrupted the riparian zones, causing siltation and other 
problems, thereby reducing their water holding capabilities. 
The interruption of the physical integrity of these zones 
has disturbed habitat corridors resulting in reduced species 
migration, and reproduction. This is also relevant for the hills 
in the city, that are encroached upon by informal settlements 
and unauthorized building construction, as well. Citizen groups 
have been active in protecting some of these critical assets of 
the city by carrying our cleanliness and plantation drives. 

The city experiences disruptions from flooding of the 
Mula-Mutha River when upstream dam flood gates are 
opened. However, a rejuvenation plan for the river is to be 
implemented and should help in mitigating some of the issues.

Rising air pollution levels, primarily due to vehicular exhaust 
and construction dust, is a growing public health concern.

transient greenhouse-induced warming is expected to be, 
greater over land than over the oceans’. These effects have 
been observed more prominently over the last 50 years as 
one of the adverse outcomes of urbanization and have had a 
direct impact on human health and urban energy consumption 
patterns. Over the past 35 years, more than 20,000 people

have died of heat-related causes in Indian megacities4. Pune 
is impacted by this pattern as well, as climate change has 
systematically increased temperatures for the city.

Green spaces in and around the city partly mitigate these 
challenges – Pune currently has over 4 m2/capita of open 
space, owing to its natural topographic features and green 
cover, but only specific areas of the city benefit from this 
green cover.

Functional fragmentation of the public administration system 
and limited mainstreaming of environmental planning and 
management have exacerbated challenges, but an engaged 
civil society has played a leadership role to push key 
environmental priorities.

Environmental systems are complex and span across 
administrative boundaries. Bureaucratic management 

procedures make planning and coordination for these 
ecological assets difficult, especially when there is currently 
no institution mandated to oversee regional, cross-ecosystem 
planning. Limited efforts in collecting, analyzing and using 
data to make decisions, has attributed to poor coordination 
among agencies while hesitance to make information public 
has limited the participation of private and civil society actors 
to arrive at solutions. 

Development Plans have historically been land-use centric, 
with the exception of the Draft Development Plan of 2007-
2027 that incorporated a plan to protect the surrounding hills 
by converting them into Biodiversity Parks. Although there 
are implementation challenges, since almost 40% of the land 
designated as biodiversity parks is privately owned and needs 
to be acquired with due compensation, this is a substantial win 
for the civil society of Pune that initiated and mobilized for this 
approval to come from the state government of Maharashtra.

MULA-MUTHA RIVERFRONT DEVELOPMENT

The Mula and Mutha rivers have been faced with severe issues of pollution 
by sewage and solid waste, and see reduced flows of water due to 
upstream dams. PMC has initiated an INR 2600 Cr river development 
project where it envisages keeping the river clean and making it pollution-
free, reducing risk of flooding, creating a continuous public realm along 
the river, retaining water, improving city’s access to the riverfront, and 
integrating heritage structures, current activities, parks and gardens.

PASHAAN LAKE RESTORATION-PASHAAN BIODIVERSITY PARK

Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had reserved Bio-diversity Parks for 
restoring the local flora and fauna, to produce carbon sinks and to create 
awareness about nature conversation. Under the Pashan Lake restoration 
project carried out under JNNURM* and as part of the biodiversity park, 
desilted the lake and created an island in the middle of the lake to attract 
birds. However, the lake faces operations and maintenance challenges 
after the funding ended and brings to light the need for focus on financial 
sustainability of other ongoing large-scale projects like that of Mula-Mutha 
Rejuvenation. Restoration also highlights challenges due to the lack of a 
singular body mandated to undertake holistic environmental decision-
making in Pune.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCITY CONTEXTRESILIENCE DIAGNOSISRESILIENCE STRATEGYIMPLEMENTING RESILIENCERESILIENT PUNENevertheless, effective urban governance and 
basic service delivery are significant levers...
Viewed as a high performing urban local body, Pune has made strides in enhancing service 
delivery for its citizens; however, considerable coordination is required between various 
governing bodies to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth, alongside deepening of civil 
society engagement in decision-making processes.

Pune is part of an ever-growing urban agglomeration, 
which is governed by two different corporations, parastatal 
agencies and state-level departments making co-ordination 
and systems level thinking somewhat challenging.

Pune and its twin city of Pimpri-Chinchwad, considered an 
industrial township, are both managed by their respective 
Municipal Corporations and are highly independent, which 
has implications for how resources are allocated, and how 
planning is conducted in the broader Pune Metropolitan 
Region. As described in the previous sections, multiple 
state and local agencies have mandates to oversee different 
aspects of a single service or asset. 

Pune has made significant advances in service delivery, 
achieving wide coverage with the political will and 
resources to do more.

Delivery levels for key public services such as solid waste, 
access to toilets, and access to water surpass much bigger 
municipal corporations. Even in informal settlements, 
access to key public services is better than other major 
cities (e.g. household toilets are accessible to 55% of slum 
dwellers and electrification rates are at 90%)5. However, the 
areas of solid waste management and sewerage treatment 
need improvements across various aspects of their value 
chains (described in commentary on the right.) The city 
has undertaken major initiatives to augment capacities and 
improve in various areas, e.g. the River Pollution Abatement 
and Sewerage Project, Strategic Waste Management Plan 
2017-2025, and 24x7 Water Supply. 

PMC has built greater transparency, accountability, and 
citizen centricity in its administrative processes compared 
to most other cities in India.

PMC has brought about reform in its property tax regimes, 
levies on civic services, and introduced transparent 
accounting practices. Pune has also instituted a system of 
regularly monitoring major financial transactions with the 
municipal chief auditor at the helm. Greater transparency 
has come through the city’s open data platform, which has 
allowed a wide range of stakeholders to engage with Pune’s 
challenges, and hold the local government accountable. The 
city has also made it easier for citizens to pay their property 
taxes with payment kiosks set up across the city. Citizens 
can also voluntarily declare their properties for taxation 
without attracting any penalties leading to an increase in tax 
collection.

A vibrant and active civil society in the city monitors the 
administration on various issues. 

Groups in the city have advocated and mobilized for action 
on various socio-economic, and environmental justice 
issues. They have done so by proactively providing technical 
expertise and have negotiated with government and 
businesses for consensus building. An example of this is seen 
in The Biodiversity Parks (BDP) project that was included 
in Pune’s draft Development Plan (DP) for 2007-2027, 
which came to be known as the Green DP by citizens. With 
considerable pressure from environmentalists, reservation of 
the land on surrounding city hills for biodiversity parks was 
approved by the state government. Land acquisition, under 
PMC Building Dept, is still pending, but once acquired the 
lands stand to be developed as BDP by the PMC Garden Dept. 

DATA AND COMMENTARY ON KEY AREAS OF SERVICE DELIVERY:
Water Supply Management. With 93% of households connected to water supply, Pune has sufficient water, with 219 
litres per capita per day (lpcd) at gross level compared to 150 lpcd benchmarked by the Government of India (GoI). 
To meet 100% coverage, PMC has undertaken the 24x7 Water Supply project to ensure all households in Pune receive 
safe and equitable supply of water for the next 30 years. The focus has been to improve supply by minimizing losses 
due to leakages in distribution networks, improving metering, and reducing non-revenue water.

Municipal Sewerage Management. According to the PMC Environmental Status Report 2017, out of the 750 MLD 
sewerage generated, only 567 MLD gets treated. Inadequate sewage treatment capacity contributes to the ineffective 
management of grey water and fecal sludge which finds its way into the city’s rivers, polluting not just the surface 
water but also ground water. The city has undertaken the Mula-Mutha Pollution Abatement project supported by JICA, 
to augment and increase the number of sewage treatment facilities. On the toilets access front, the city has very strong 
coverage, civil society organizations continue to facilitate the construction of individual and community toilets in slums.

Solid Waste Management. Average total waste generated in Pune is ~1,700 Metric Tons per Day (TPD). Pune 
faces challenges in solid waste collection and segregation of waste at source. In addition, there is also a shortfall in 
treatment capacity at existing facilities. The city has launched several initiatives to better manage its waste, including 
a three-year contract for solid waste collection with SWaCH, a cooperative of self-employed waste collectors and 
other urban poor. The city also rolled out a Solid Waste Management Strategy Plan 2017-2025 with the objective of 
minimizing waste generated, 100% door-to-door collection, 100% processing, IT enabled monitoring and tracking of 
waste, etc. The city also intends to completely stop open dumping of waste on landfill sites by 2020.

RIVER POLLUTION ABATEMENT AND SEWERAGE PROJECT

PMC is implementing the River Pollution Abatement and Sewerage Project 
supported by funding from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 
A loan agreement was signed on 13th Jan 2016 with JICA for pollution 
abatement of the Mula-Mutha River in Pune by January 2022, under the 
National River Conservation Plan. The major components proposed under 
the project include construction of 11 new Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), 
which will result in the creation of an additional treatment capacity of 396 
million litres per day (MLD) over the existing treatment capacity of 477 
MLD, laying of 113.6 kms of sewer lines, and renovation/rehabilitation of 4 
existing intermediate pumping stations. A consultant has been appointed 
for further support to the project.    

The total cost of the project, estimated at INR 990 crores, will be shared 
in the ratio of 85:15 between the Central Government (CG) and the Pune 
Municipal Corporation (PMC) respectively. 

And Pune’s robust finances also make it 
attractive for investments
PMC has exhibited strong financial performance with revenue surpluses supported by effective 
collection of taxes, transparency and accountability in governance, and political stability. 
These have enhanced Pune’s creditworthiness and attractiveness for investment, unlocking 
access to large financing pools such as municipal bonds for infrastructure development. 

PMC has robust finances compared to other Indian cities 
with significant dependence on own-source revenue and 
improvement in per-capita capital expenditure, on average 
over the last three years.

Pune is the second city in India, after Mumbai, with the 
highest proportion of own-source revenue, and is among 
the top three in India, with own sources contributing greater 
than 50% of the total revenue. Thus, with low dependency on 
state and national grants, Pune has greater fiscal autonomy 
compared to other cities in India. 

The total municipal budget/revenue has increased from INR 
3,167 crores (USD 0.46 Bn) in FY 2013-14 to INR 5,912 crores 
(USD 0.87 Bn) in the FY 2018-19 budget. Major sources of 
revenue comprise Goods and Services Tax6 (GST) (35%), 
followed by property tax (30%), and building permission 
& development fee (14%). The city improved efficiencies 
in property tax collection by setting up payment kiosks, 
improving online information, and starting a voluntary 
disclosure scheme for citizens to declare their property for 
taxation without penalty. The share of building permission 
fees in total income reflects the demand for housing and 
commercial activities and the increasing urban growth in 
Pune. The city also raised civic taxes like water tax and user 
charges on public services to ensure that the economic base 
for the services was covered. For example, it raised water 
charges for 2016-2017 by 12% and plans to increase them 
every year till 2020-2021 by 15%. This is expected to lead to a 

96% hike from existing rates.

The replacement of Local Body Tax (LBT) with the Goods 
and Services Tax (GST) might pose some future challenges.

Before introduction of GST, PMC’s major source of income 
was a Local Body Tax, which was discontinued this year 
(FY 2017-18) in favor of GST. The introduction of a Goods 
and Services Tax regime in India has meant that municipal 
corporations across the country have ceased collections 
of the Local Body Tax (LBT). While the Government of 
Maharashtra has compensated PMC for the loss in revenue, 
it is unknown if the compensation will be commensurate 
with expected LBT collections in the long term. As the 
entire country adjusts to the new GST rules, PMC may face 
uncertainty in the transition period. PMC has presented 
budget surpluses for most of the last few years until this year, 
with such structural and cyclical changes leading to a deficit. 

Despite these challenges, PMC is one of few AA+ rated 
municipal governments in the country with the opportunity 
to tap further into commercial markets to access capital for 
growth.

PMC has decided to undergo a credit rating exercise since 
the introduction of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal 
Mission (JNNURM). Both India Ratings and CARE Rating 
have assigned PMC with the AA+ rating with ‘stable’ outlook. 
The key drivers for these ratings were higher reliance on

PUNE RANKS 1ST IN ANNUAL SURVEY 
OF INDIA’S CITY-SYSTEMS (ASICS) 2017

Bengaluru-based non-profit organization Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship 
and Democracy, released the 5th edition of its Annual Survey of India’s 
City-systems (ASICS) report comparing 23 cities in India along four 
dimensions of governance: urban planning and design; urban capacities and 
resources; empowered and legitimate political representation; transparency, 
and accountability and participation. Pune ranked first, with a score of 
5.1 on a scale of 10, followed by Kolkata and Thiruvananthapuram. The 
report also indicates where Indian metros stand when compared with 
megacities elsewhere. According to the 2017 report, Johannesburg in South 
Africa, London in the UK, and New York in the US scored 7.6, 8.8, and 8.8 
respectively. See appendix for Pune’s report card.

MUNICIPAL BOND FOR 24x7 WATER SUPPLY PROJECT

In December 2016, the Prime Minister urged Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (SEBI) and Department of Economic Affairs to ensure that at least 
10 cities in India issue municipal bonds within one year in the context of the 
‘Smart Cities Mission’. Additionally, the Union Government has proposed 
to give a compensation of 2% interest subsidy on the total size of the bond 
issue. Both these events have been pivotal in providing an impetus to PMC’s 
Municipal Bonds programme. On June 22nd, 2017, Pune became the first city 
in the country to issue municipal bonds since the publication of ‘Issue and 
Listing of Debt Securities by Municipalities Regulations, 2015’ by SEBI. PMC 
became the issuer of the largest municipal bond in India’s history with an  
INR 200 Cr (USD 30 million) issue at the Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai, 
to fund a 24X7 water supply scheme for all residents in the city. 

PMC aims to mobilize INR 2,264 crore through municipal bonds in five years, 
starting 2017, for the 24X7 Water Supply project estimated to cost INR 2,818 
crore. The first INR 200 Crores were issued in June 2017 at a coupon of 7.59%, 
which will be paid twice in a year. The debt servicing will be from two streams 
of revenue, user charges and property tax. The property tax will be parked in 
an escrow account, which is the designated account for repayments.

100RC CITY RESILIENCE PROCESS IN PUNE

The 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative, was 
pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation. The 
initiative helped cities build resilience towards their 
respective social, economic, and physical challenges. 
It did so by providing technical assistance and tools, 
access to services of global organizations, and 
opportunities to exchange experiences and best 
practices among member cities.

Pune was selected to join the 100Rc network in 2016. 
The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), led by the CRO’s 
Office, introspected on Pune’s shocks/stresses, resilience 
strengths/opportunities, analyzed ongoing and new 
initiatives, and developed a resilience strategy. To do 
this work, the CRO’s Office was institutionalized within 
the PMC. This enabled the team to engage a wide variety

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCITY CONTEXTRESILIENCE DIAGNOSISRESILIENCE STRATEGYIMPLEMENTING RESILIENCERESILIENT PUNEStakeholder Engagement

The CRO spent time in building valuable relationships both inside 
and outside the PMC to synergize efforts and build coalitions. 

GAIN TRUST

BUILD CREDIBILITY

PROVE VALUE

The CRO spent considerable time in 
the beginning of Phase 1 in stakeholder 
engagement. Because the Pune Office 
of Resilience is institutionalized within 
the PMC, the CRO has been designated 
office space within the PMC Disaster 
Management Cell. With initial support 
and guidance from the Commissioner’s 
Office, the CRO has been able to have 
significant face time with various 
heads of departments, technocrats, 
and key personnel working in the 
corporation. His ability to navigate 
through institutional hierarchies and 
perseverance in building one-on-one 
relationships helped him gain trust. 
Stakeholder mapping done with the 
strategy partner and the CRO’s own 
professional networks, helped the 
team identify individuals in other local 
government offices, academia, and in 
the private and civil society sectors who 
provided insights and can be potential 
collaborators. 

43

The CRO’s technical background 
in civil engineering, professional 
work in urban consulting, and deep 
understanding of Pune through lived 
experience helped him build initial 
credibility with people. Through 
Phase 1, he was able to identify 
champions that became anchors 
for some of the thematic working 
groups and helped him understand 
nuances of challenges and actions 
taken by the city. In turn, he has 
been leveraging the 100RC platform 
to connect them with necessary 
support, like technical knowledge or 
global best practices when needed, 
and has also been creating space for 
them to take ownership of how the 
strategy is designed.

The working groups for Pune have been 
very well attended and average to about 
15 members per group. This has required 
the CRO to make phone calls to each 
member atleast twice besides email 
communication to coordinate schedules 
and ensure they prioritized attendance. 
A briefing document with participants 
before the meeting and a summary note 
shared after have ensured transparency 
and allowed for information to be 
documented and disseminated. 
Visits by the 100RC Pune team to meet 
with the mayor, commissioner, additional 
municipal commissioners, and key staff 
members, learn about their perceptions of 
shocks and stresses and share the 100RC 
offering, has given the PMC more  
confidence in the CRO’s Office and the 
value it brings. One such meeting directly 
resulted in an Additional Commissioner 
presiding over a working group on 
environment giving the CRO greater 
convening power.

The city’s shocks and stresses were prioritized based on 
inputs from citizens, government officials, civil society 
leaders, academics, and private sector leaders. A citizen 
survey was deployed online and offline, which helped identify 
priority shocks and stresses. These were juxtaposed to 
results from the agenda setting workshop (annex) and other 
stakeholder interactions. Based on this, ‘Mobility’, ‘Air Quality’, 
‘Availability of Affordable Housing’, ‘Garbage Management’, 
‘Health of Water Bodies’, and ‘Condition of Tekdis/Hills’ were 
identified as priority stresses, while ‘disease outbreak’ as a 
priority shock area for the city. Below, each stress and shock, 
and its implications are discussed.

100RC’s proprietary Perceptions Assessment Tool (PAT) was used to source and analyze the perceptions 
e
s
of city leaders and civil society actors on key resilience strengths and weaknesses. A mixed method 
a
h
approach was used which included expert surveys, working group sessions, and inputs from the Agenda 
P
Setting Workshop. One-on-one interviews with city champions helped validate hypotheses on priority 
strengths and weaknesses. Below, key resilience strengths and weaknesses are discussed.

250 plus resilience related actions from the year 2005 onwards were sourced from publicly available 
documents. These were verified with Heads of Departments at the Pune Municipal Corporation and 
were also checked against municipal budgets (past two years) and confirmed with stakeholders across 
government, civil society, and academia. The purpose of this activity was to identify actions and gaps in 
resilience efforts across different drivers of resilience, against evolving priority areas.

ACTION 1.1.1
Improve processes and capacities for integrated development planning in Pune 
region

The Pune metropolitan region has multiple institutional levels 
and entities undertaking development planning. While each 
local authority is mandated to prepare its own development 
plan responding to locale-specific needs, stronger mechanisms 
are needed for synergizing these plans towards enhancing 
resilience and sustainability at the regional scale. Strategic 
planning for the urban area by PMRDA and municipal 
jurisdictions by PMC and PCMC, while also enabling local area 
plans may be the way forward. Innovative approaches and 

instruments may also be needed. 

Transit projects (metro, BRT, High Capacity Mass Transit Road) 
and addition of peri-urban areas are opportunities for new 
models of development planning, such as Transit Oriented 
Development and Local Area Plans. Plan frame-works are 
also needed to rejuvenate old core, high density areas that 
have below-par building stocks and services, while conserving 
heritage precincts and the pre-motorization urban fabric.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCITY CONTEXTRESILIENCE DIAGNOSISRESILIENCE STRATEGYIMPLEMENTING RESILIENCERESILIENT PUNEAs Pune’s population and urban 
spread increases, three broad spatial 
patterns emerge – a congested core of 
historic significance, medium density 
neighbourhoods that surround the core, 
and rapidly urbanizing peri-urban areas 
with governance deficit, witnessing 
haphazard township developments 
proximate to large employment centres. 

The rapid urbanization following the 
booming economic opportunities in the 
region, with no institutions mandated 
to foresee and predictively plan and 
monitor these services, have accentuated 
environmental as well as infrastructural 
stresses of mobility and affordable 
housing. For example, there is no single 
authority or process that oversees the 
convergence of works by the traffic dept, 
road dept, public bus & metro mobility 
services. Similarly housing adequacy is not 
measured or comprehensively planned for. 

The development plans only cover land-use 
in their scope, and therefore integration 
of mobility, environment, economic 
development is overlooked, causing 
uneven and unsustainable growth. As the 
34 surrounding villages get incorporated 
into PMC over the next few years, nearly 
doubling its footprint, it is imperative to 
guide growth and to ensure that the citizen 
experience across the region is equitable 
along various development parameters. 
Enhancing citizen engagement and 
promoting social cohesion, especially in 
areas populated with new migrants (both 
high-income professionals and livelihood-
seeking populace) will make these 
communities more resilient. 

GOAL 1.1
Promote integrated 
development planning 
in Pune urban region

GOAL 1.2
Strengthen low carbon & 
shared mobility services in 
Pune urban region 

GOAL 1.3
Ensure access to safe, 
secure, adequate & 
affordable housing for all

GOAL 1.4
Strengthen pathways 
for democratic decision-
making & civic participation

as mobility planning, ecosystem conservation, economic 
development, and re-development of older/core city 
areas into land-use and development planning is evident, 
given the desire to enhance resilience in the urban region. 
The absence of a modern urban planning framework, 
performance measures of spatial plans, and common digital 
GIS base map across agencies lead to weak plans, and 
inadequate implementation and enforcement. This results 
in unregulated growth, destruction or degradation of 
natural assets, and failure or inadequacy of infrastructure. 
The city becomes more susceptible to shocks such 
as extreme weather events. Chronic stresses emerge, 
exacerbating poverty and disease due to unhealthy 
environments.

Transit projects (metro, BRT, High Capacity Mass Transit 
Road) that are underway in Pune provide an opportunity 
to develop new models of development planning, such 

as Transit Oriented Development and Local Area Plans. 
Guidelines are also needed for re-development of high 
density areas that have below par building stocks and 
services, while conserving heritage precincts and the 
pre-motorization urban fabric. Currently the surrounding 
villages that are to be integrated into the PMC, will have 
a separate Development Plan. Thus there is a need for 
integration of the multiple Development Plans into one 
‘Strategic Plan’ for the entire municipal jurisdiction, while 
enabling local area plans.

Enhance resilience at the regional scale including by mapping environmental 
assets and integrating conservation objectives into development plans 

As the largest city in the metropolitan region, Pune impacts 
the region; conversely, a large population within Pune will be 
impacted by regional-scale developments and changes. It is 
in the interest of all local self-governments (PMC, PCMC and 
towns and villages in the region) to be aware of resilience 
challenges and take steps to enhance resilience at the 
regional scale. PMC as an important stakeholder can advocate 
improved natural resource conservation, especially water and 
biodiversity, integrated land-use and mobility planning, as well 
as help enhance appropriate economic growth in the region. 

A key strategy to do this is to map natural/near natural lands/
ecosystems and other environmental assets and maintain such 
information as part of the Geographic Information Systems of 
planning authorities for consideration in planning processes. 

Pilot projects may be initiated with a view of securing natural 
resources through instruments such as Payment for Ecosystem 
Services (PES), conservation easements and Transfer of 
Development Rights. The feasibility of these instruments, within 
the current planning legislative framework, needs to be assessed.

GOAL 1.2
Strengthen low 
carbon & shared 
mobility services in 
Pune urban region 

WHY?

Rapid increases in the urban area and population, and 
the inability of transportation planning and service 
provision to keep pace, have generally been seen as the 
reason for the increase in private motorized modes of 
passenger transport. The adverse impacts of this trend 
include increased road crashes and fatalities, increased 
health impacts from air pollution and driving stress, 
time wasted in congestion and increased contribution 
to climate change. The National Urban Transport Policy, 
2006, lays the direction for improvements in this sector. 
The PMRDA, PMC and PCMC have also taken up projects 
for improvement, such as Pune Metro, Rainbow BRTS, the 
Comprehensive Bicycle Master Plan, and the Pune Streets 
Projects. However, critical gaps in institutional structures, 
coordination, and understanding are preventing and/or 
delaying the transition to sustainable mobility in Pune.

ACTION 1.2.2
Improve bus-based public transit 

The PMRDA, PMC, PCMC, PMPML, Traffic Police and RTO 
have a role in transportation planning, infrastructure, 
service provision and regulation, and they have taken up 
transportation improvements. These include preparation 
of mobility plans, infrastructure for metro, BRTS, ‘complete 
streets’ projects, public bicycling, etc. 

However, critical gaps in institutional structures, coordination, 
and understanding are preventing and/or delaying the 

transition to sustainable mobility in Pune. It is essential 
that all government agencies linked to mobility planning, 
infrastructure development and service delivery in Pune have 
a comprehensive and coherent approach with adequate 
institutional and technical capacities.

District Collector, Maha Metro, PMPML, RTO, Traffic Police

Bus-based public transit is the backbone of the public 
transportation system in the Pune region, providing 
affordable mobility through an extensive network operated 
by the Pune Mahanagar Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML). However, 
the quality of bus-based transit services has declined 
tremendously in recent years due to lack of adequate funding 
from the primary stakeholders (PMC and PCMC). This is 
exacerbated by inadequate allocation of land parcels for bus 
depots/ parking and workshops, and weak regulation through 

the Regional Transport Authority. Repeated leadership 
changes, lack of long-term strategic planning mechanisms, 
and a near absence of public engagement are institutional 
challenges. Improvements are needed through actions 
external to the PMPML (such as investment, land-use planning 
linkages, regulation) as well as internal to PMPML (technical 
capacity, management, public engagement).

Integrate and improve para-transit and shuttle operations for last mile and local 
area shared mobility

ACTION 1.2.4
Improve facilities for pedestrians and cyclists

Short local trips currently made by private motorized modes 
could be converted to shared modes, with local circulator 
services. This would help create a more conducive environment 
for on-street parking demand management, which if 
implemented, would help free up street space for pedestrians 
and cyclists. 

Para-transit providers are primarily in the informal sector, such 

as share-rickshaws and six-seater services. Better integration 
of these informal services into the PMC’s mobility plans will 
help improve shared transport services in areas under-serviced 
by public transport, for local circulator services and as last mile 
connectivity.

Leads: RTO, Traffic Police, Auto rickshaw unions/associations, 
PMC 

Facilities for walking designed with universal access principles, 
cycling or non-motorized transport are essential elements in 
any city. PMC has already formulated a Pedestrian Policy, a 
Parking Policy, developed Urban Street Design Guidelines, and 
a Comprehensive Bicycle Master Plan.  
Implementation of the Pune Streets Program is underway, 
through which about 100 kms are to be developed as 
‘complete streets’.  

These projects need to be continued and supported. As 
non-motorized transportation planning and infrastructure 

development are relatively new areas of work in India, it is 
important to enhance institutional and technical capacity at 
the PMC to effectively implement these new initiatives.

Civil society engagement is also essential to effect a transition 
in street design and usage. For this, a multi-stakeholder 
partnership could be devised with options for corporate 
groups, commercial associations, educational institutions, etc., 
to join.

Institute a comprehensive public engagement program on sustainable mobility 

While PMC has taken steps for strengthening mobility 
services, lack of public understanding and support delays the 
transition to a sustainable mobility system in Pune. Protection 
of pedestrian and cyclist facilities, acceptance of parking 
regulations, and the shift to more sustainable modes requires 
public support. Equally, public engagement is needed for local 
refinement of new physical infrastructure and services being 
put in place. 

Improved public understanding and engagement can be the 

leverage that will result in better physical designs and systems, 
as well as exert pressure on political and administrative 
systems. It may the most enduring approach to enable the 
transition and future sustainability.

Concomitantly, adequate institutional capacity to undertake 
public engagement, and actual processes to inform and 
engage the public, would enable a smoother and more rapid 
system transition.

Housing policies seem to have focused on the construction 
of new units with little impact on reducing housing vacancy 
of 20-25%. Not just this, policies have also not been able 
to address the supply-demand mismatch, especially in 
low-income housing segments, showing the inability of 
the current market mechanisms to bridge the gap. These 
have been especially difficult to assess, plan, and monitor 
with no single authority mandated to oversee housing in 
the urban region and limited data for the market to make 
relevant products. These challenges are further expected 
to exacerbate with the incorporation of additional villages 
and doubling of the jurisdiction area under the PMC.

housing market 

In Pune, low-income housing drives nearly 75% of the housing 
demand but only about 4% of the supply; with majority of the 
supply directed towards the middle-income group. Almost 
90% of the local housing stock in Indian cities is met by local 
developers. However, private developers have traditionally 
not able to meet the low-income housing demands because 
of limited availability of low cost developable land in the city, 
long government approval processes that drive up interest 
on borrowed capital, high stamp duty and registration costs, 
limited access to finance for small developers, and poor 
professional management of their businesses. 

Recent reforms like the introduction of Maharashtra Real 
Estate Regulation and Development Act (MahaRERA), 
infrastructure status accorded to affordable housing, lower 
interest rates and reduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
rate for affordable homes, new PPP policies to incentivize 
private land for affordable housing, and the various delivery 
models under PMAY Urban are encouraging the real estate

and banking sectors to meet the low-cost housing demand. 
Rise in affordable housing finance companies backed by 
the National Housing Bank and affordable housing fund 
is improving access to finance for beneficiaries. Though, 
more can be done here to ensure identification of correct 
beneficiaries, increase outreach through micro mortgage 
financing mechanisms and self-help groups (SHGs), and 
flexible repayment mechanisms for loans to cater to variable 
income flows.

The local government in Pune needs to ensure housing supply 
is met through inclusive housing polices while developing 
transit-oriented development, earmarking land for low-cost 
housing in the development plans, and ensuring building 
permissions for quality, and well-connected, low-cost housing 
is fast-tracked with transparency and accountability from 
developers.

Between 20-25% of 2011 residential census housing in Pune 
was lying vacant. A large percentage of this is attributed 
to investor housing bought for capital appreciation rather 
than rental income. Rental yields in India are not lucrative 
enough, averaging at 2-4%, much lower than global averages 
as per IDFC Institute’s analysis. Returns are also lower than 
the more secure government bonds in India. In addition, 
further challenges in enforcing contracts that do not protect 
landlords adequately, and long and expensive judiciary 
processes in case of conflict, dissuade investments in the 
rental market. 

But there is great merit in developing a healthy rental 

ecosystem given Pune’s large populace of students, young 
professionals, and migrant workers. For low-income households 
that often work in the informal sector, rental housing better 
suits their income volatility and risk profile. Thus it is access 
to housing, not ownership, that is of primary importance. To 
bring the vast available stock of vacant housing into the rental 
market, there is considerable space for the emergence of rental 
management companies (RMCs) that can professionally manage 
and rent out properties on behalf of the owners. This will be 
possible if policy measures create an enabling environment.

Strengthen pathways 
for democratic 
decision-making & 
civic participation in 
local area planning 

WHY?

The rapid pace of urbanization poses challenges for 
governance. Aspects such as societal heterogeneity, 
structural inequalities, varied literacy levels add to the 
complexity of urban sustainability issues. While rural 
areas in India have the ‘gram sabha’, there is no analogous 
institution in cities, where citizens can participate in civic 
matters in their neighbourhoods. This impacts not just 
accountability of municipalities, but quality of democracy 
itself. Low levels of transparency in finances and operations 
of municipalities worsens this problem. 

It is recognized that public participation in cities must 
improve, e.g. urban planning guidelines by Govt of India 
mention the need for public participation (URDPFI 2015). 
A provision for Area Sabhas was added to the Maharashtra 
Municipal Act in 2009, but not implemented as rules have 
not been made. In addition, Public Disclosure Law is not 
implemented in spirit despite being enacted. The lack 
of well-structured public engagement and participation 

processes impedes problem analysis, search for 
alternatives and innovations, and implementing solutions.

Innovations are needed in processes of public engagement 
and participation in civic matters to help harness 
the wisdom of the public, improve trust and enable 
collaborative problem solving, be especially responsive 
to the needs of vulnerable and marginalized groups, and 
enhance well-being.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

GOAL ENDORSED BY

ACTION 1.4.1
Institute policies and undertake capacity building at PMC for inclusive local area 
participatory planning and public engagement

Public participation is important for urban sustainability and 
effective governance. However, there is no policy or guideline 
adopted about why, when and how public engagement may 
be done as part of civic public governance. In the absence of 
a policy, good practice guidelines, and standards, the efforts 
made for public participation often fall short, leading to under-
alignment between program goals and citizen needs, and 
greater mistrust of the government by the public.

The ambition of instituting participatory processes must 
be accompanied with some effort on capacity building to 
anchor and conduct participatory processes in an inclusive, 
thoughtful and effective manner. This will include supportive 
administration, trained facilitators and civic or public capacity 
to contribute as informed participants.

Formal forums such as an Area Sabha, analogous to the 
‘gram sabha’, are needed to enable participation. These are 
envisaged under the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 
but not yet operationalized.  

Pilot projects will help develop and refine methods of inclusive 
and effective public engagement in the urban context. The 
role of Area Sabhas is to deliberate on civic issues and engage 
with corporators and the civic administration, be informed 
about plans and budgets for local area, provide inputs and 
suggestions for plans and projects in local area, raise issues 
and ensure timely redress of various grievances and increase 

accountability of corporator and civic administration. 

PMC already has e-governance systems and is using ICT 
tools for public outreach and complaints management. The 
experiences with participatory approaches shows that the 
higher populations and densities of urban areas would require 
innovation in ICT tools, which could support meaningful 
participation. Such efforts to strengthen structured, inclusive,

The long history of social movements and the high degree of 
decentralization and devolution due to the 74th Constitutional 
Amendment Act (CAA) as implemented by Maharashtra 
state, has led to PMC’s representative democratic institution 
to be among the strongest in the country. In recent years, 
the average voter turnout in election is declining, which 
undermines representation and democracy. The reasons 
include high levels of migration and difficulty in registration 
in electoral rolls. There is also erosion of trust that individual 
votes make a difference, and low visibility of progress of civic 
works. Studies show that non-participation in elections is 
higher among marginalized migrant communities, as well as 
youth from higher income groups. Participation in Municipal 
elections is lower compared to state and national election, 
with wards that are further away from city core showing 

lower turnout. This spatial variance is attributed to low PMC 
engagement and service levels in these areas.

In order to improve democratic outcomes, not only is it 
important to update electoral rolls, but also enhanced 
civic engagement and encouragement for the exercise of 
citizenship and franchise. Projects to support the PMC Election 
Dept in regular and ongoing updation of electoral rolls, and 
campaigns to encourage people to register, especially among 
marginalized groups are recommended. Simultaneously, 
outreach to different types of rare and intermittent voters, 
especially youth, can help improve voter turnout and 
democratic outcomes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCITY CONTEXTRESILIENCE DIAGNOSISRESILIENCE STRATEGYIMPLEMENTING RESILIENCERESILIENT PUNEValued for its climate and access to 
natural environment, Pune has been 
experiencing severe degradation of its 
ecological resources. Ecosystem benefits 
are often considered extraneous and 
devalued in development planning and 
infrastructure creation. Degradation or 
destruction of the natural environment, 
as well as introduction of invasive alien 
elements, can result in exacerbation of 
extreme weather events, flash floods, 
landslides and spread of disease. Further, 
sections of the urban poor population, 
and certain migrant communities, have 
direct dependencies on natural resources. 

The overarching issue is to mainstream 
environmental thinking within the 
governments in the Pune metropolitan 
region. The focus is currently on 
compliance with environmental standards, 
and instead needs to be proactive 
environmental planning that recognizes 
the role natural assets play in making the 
city resilient, and the lives of people safer, 
healthier and enriched. 

The objective of this pillar is on 
solutions that broadly institutionalize 
environmental planning while building 
capacities across departments within the 
PMC, and in the PMR, to better manage 
the natural resources in the city. The 
knowledge, capacities and efforts of 
different civil society and community 
groups are valuable resources to enhance 
environmental planning and conservation. 
Enabling structures and processes 
to enhance public participation in 
environment conservation are also a focus 
of this pillar, that intersects with pillar 1.

WHY?

Environmental governance encompasses various functions 
of different line departments and institutions in the 
Pune urban region right from water to waste, energy to 
gardens, transport to forests, housing to service provision, 
education to planning, culture and heritage. The public, 
too, has historically been active in bringing environmental 
concerns to the forefront of governance in Pune. However, 
there is a lack of an overarching, responsive and proactive 
environmental governance framework and coordination 
mechanism among various institutional actors. 

Efforts are needed to build upon the historical perspective, 
further curate knowledge and databases. This should be 
used to advance evidence-based policy-making and scenario 
building for future predictions and comprehensive planning.

GOAL ENDORSED BY

ACTION 2.1.1
Expand institutional mandate and capacity of PMC to conduct proactive 
environmental planning and monitoring

The PMC has a mandate for improving the urban environment. 
Currently, the Environment Dept is part of the Garden Dept. 
Among the activities of the Environment Dept are technical 
inputs for certain types of projects directly impacting 
natural ecosystems in the city, preparation of the mandatory 
Environment Status Report by compilation of secondary 
data and analysis of certain types of primary environment 
monitoring data, and management of the Indradhanushya 
facility. The Garden Dept manages all the public gardens, 
maintains avenue trees, conducts the Tree Census, supports the 
Tree Officer in managing the applications for tree-felling, etc. 

There is a need for a more comprehensive style of management 
of the urban environment that includes the prevention 
of pollution, remediation and restoration of degraded 
environments, protection and conservation of natural assets, and 
addressing climate change impacts. The SDG framework is well 
aligned with resilience enhancement. Setting up a monitoring 
and reporting system for the set of goals and indicators relevant 
at the city level would be very useful in resilience efforts. 
This will require strengthening the Environment Dept with an 
enlarged mandate, enhanced technical capacity, growth in 
human resources and proper budget allocation.

projects may be initiated with a view of developing ways 
of strengthening and supporting community stewardship, 
especially with a focus on knowledge about sound ecosystems 
management. These initiatives would go a long way in 
improving natural landscapes and resilience of the Pune region.

Biodiversity provides multiple ecosystem benefits to urban 
dwellers. These include direct benefits such as places for 
recreation, as well as as sources of food, firewood, medicinal 
herbs and forage for cattle and sheep, supporting life and 
livelihoods of various vulnerable and marginalized groups, such 
as dhangars (herders) and katkaris (tribals). Their traditional 
rights and use arrangements of village commons and fields 
have been disrupted with changes in urban physical form and 
governance, often causing conflicts. 

A process is needed to recognize the direct dependence on 
ecosystems and knowledge of communities, and dialogue to 
ensure sustainable use and conservation of natural assets. 
Their deeper knowledge and cultural connections are valuable, 
intangible resources that can enrich understanding about 
nature among city folks.

Study, monitor & 
proactively plan for 
ecosystem benefits 

WHY?

City development encompasses economic and 
environmental aspects of growth, with an aim to improve 
human well-being. Human settlements have enormous 
dependency on the services and benefits provided by 
natural ecosystems. Conversely, they also modify and impact 
ecosystems in many different ways. 
 
Ecosystems are dynamic systems and sub-systems. 
Developing a scientific and evidence-based understanding of 
ecosystems, their status and benefits is a critical prerequisite 
to developing conservation and sustainable use management 
plans. Studies to map these ecosystems and their status, 
and appropriate monitoring systems are essential. Such 
studies can also help in valuing the services and devise ways 
for payment of ecosystem services and conservation cost 
benefits to strengthen development strategies.

Biodiversity in urban areas is an important indicator of the 
health of the ecosystem. It influences local climate, nutrient 
recycling, air quality, water quality, provides resources 
(e.g. grazing, firewood), cultural and recreational services 
which people depend upon, directly and indirectly. These 
dependencies are not adequately mapped. PMC has taken a 
major initiative of conducting a tree census using technological 
tools. Additional data sets on species, habitats, ecosystems 
and the nature of human dependence/interrelationship need 
to be developed. Participatory methods such as People’s 
Biodiversity Registration (PBR) involving residents as well 
as migrating communities are effective in mapping cultural 
aspects of biodiversity, dependencies and in developing a 
sense of belonging.

Pune faces disease outbreak threats due to mismanagement of 
its biodiversity. Pune’s climatic conditions can aggravate this 
problem. Elements such as invasive birds like rock pigeons, 
allergen-containing plant species like the Satvin tree (Alstonia 
scholaris) have been reported to create health hazards. Pet 
breeding and owning is a fast-growing economic and cultural 
activity. Lack of any database and management system leaves 
this activity beyond the city’s administration, though animal 
welfare, public health and pounds for animals are part of the 
municipal government’s responsibility. This can be a significant 
area to create positive values for Pune’s resilience.

PMC fulfils its mandate of water supply to the city, currently 
over 1300 million litres per day, through an arrangement 
with the state Irrigation Department by which an allocation 
is made from the storage at Khadakwasla and other dams. 
With increases in water demand, Pune will need to put in 
place demand management measures, waste water recycling 
and develop groundwater resources. Currently, thousands 
of borewells are operational in the city, but the quantity of 
groundwater drawn is unknown. Groundwater provides an 

important buffer against low rainfall and shortages in surface 
water storages. Sustainable management of groundwater 
requires better information about the groundwater resources, 
and a strategy to improve recharge. In the medium-term, 
improved information and monitoring processes would help 
devise sustainable use strategies with the participation of the 
public.

Comprehensive air quality monitoring, impact studies and Air Action Plan

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has prescribed 
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in 2009 
under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. Pune 
is among the 102 cities identified across India that consistently 
violate these standards. The National Clean Air Programme 
(NCAP), launched by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and 
Climate Change, has a goal to reduce air pollution by 20-30% 
by 2024, which Pune must also comply with. 

Steps to improve air quality management and reduce health 
risks to the public include – robust systems for monitoring 
of air quality, modelling and projection of impacts, putting 
in place a detailed, locale-specific plan for mitigation of air 
pollution, and communication of health risks and mitigation

GOAL 2.3
Promote circular 
economy through 
waste management 

WHY?

Pune is recognized as a city with a progressive waste 
management system. About a decade ago, PMC 
entered into an agreement with SWaCH (Solid Waste 
Collection and Handling), a cooperative of waste pickers, 
integrating them into doorstep waste collection services. 
This has helped improve source segregation and retrieval 
of recyclables. PMC has also set up bio-methanation 
plants and incentivized composting. Yet, several hundred 
tons of waste do reach the landfill every day. 

Newer approaches of waste governance, finance, 
management and physical systems are needed to 
respond to the ideals of circular economy. Decentralized 
systems for scrap recovery and organics processing, 
improving the recycling chain and instituting Extended 
Producer Responsibility are steps that will help 
enhance the circular economy. A creative and sustained 
outreach strategy to all stakeholders and participatory 
governance that engages citizens as well as the private 
sector will help develop more robust systems, accelerate 
and smoothen the transitions desired.

HOW?

ACTION 2.3.1
Strengthen the capacity of PMC and 
the circular economy ecosystem 
towards 100% in situ processing 
of organic wastes, recovery of 
recyclables and liquid waste 
management

ACTION 2.3.2
Support formalization of scrap recycling economy and improve sanitation worker 

Over the last decade, the Pune Municipal Corporation has 
instituted doorstep waste collection through SWaCH, a 
cooperative of waste pickers that has provided safer work 
conditions and other worker benefits, as well as improved 
source segregation of wastes. Enhancing the extent of 
doorstep collection to cover the entire city, especially in areas 
that have been recently added to the municipal jurisdiction, 
and improving the quality of services are among the next set 
of priorities. 

The Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd has 
recently initiated a Zero Waste project that aims at 100% in 
situ processing of organic waste. This pilot project will help 

understand the institutional changes and capacities needed, 
including for promoting source segregation of waste streams, 
and decentralized organic waste processing. Efforts are 
also needed to enhance retrieval of recyclables, closing or 
shortening recycling loops and setting up systems to enable 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for difficult to recycle 
materials. Similarly, waste water treatment too will require 
innovations, including market-based approaches to mitigate 
untreated effluents. Good quality data, MIS and GIS on waste 
generators, collection services and processing sites would 
provide critical inputs for effective management of these 
services and facilities. 

Progress towards a Circular Economy including waste 
reduction and increasing materials recycling. In Pune, as 
in much of India, the scrap recycling economy is largely 
in the informal sector. While recycling provides economic 
and environmental gains, the informal nature of the sector 
often means hazardous work conditions and pollution from 
mismanaged materials recovery processes. 

environmental compliance is imperative. This must be done 
through participatory approaches and institutional capacity 
building. Enhancing the circular economy also means 
shortening the materials loops and reducing distances for 
transport of materials. Re-organization of the physical systems 
for materials movement and recycling may be needed to 
enhance the value of the recycling economy in Pune.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYCITY CONTEXTRESILIENCE DIAGNOSISRESILIENCE STRATEGYIMPLEMENTING RESILIENCERESILIENT PUNEPost independence, Pune has been one 
of the most dynamic urban economies 
in India. This was due to its proximity 
to Mumbai and the western coastline, 
legacy of cooperatives, industrial growth 
driven by MIDC* (especially in automotive 
manufacturing) and high human capital 
(education/skills) level as a result of being 
an educational hub. These factors also 
allowed Pune to take part in India’s IT boom. 

The region’s economy is rooted in diverse 
industry clusters of auto components, 
locomotives, agro-based products, electronic 
consumer durables, pharmaceuticals, 
chemicals, and IT software among others. 
However, recent data/trends suggest that 
some of the traditional drivers of Pune’s 
economic dynamism, especially low-skills 
manufacturing and IT/ITes, are in decline/
evolving and there is a risk that Pune will not 
be able to compete, provide jobs/livelihoods 
and meet the aspirations of its young 
educated population. The adverse impact 
is more severe in the informal sector, with a 
majority facing multi-dimensional poverty.

In conclusion, for Pune to leverage its 
strengths, there is a need for the city 
to develop sectors beyond IT and auto 
industry, especially those that generate 
high employment but also absorb the city’s 
skilled graduates. Pune has the potential 
to transform itself from being just an 
educational hub to also being a regional 
centre of critical research and innovation. 
However, for the economy to be truly 
resilient for all, multiple stresses faced by the 
most vulnerable workers in the city need to 
be addressed to capitalize on the potential 
of its citizens.

Boost Pune’s 
economy through 
skilling and support 
for business

WHY?

HOW?

Government of Maharashtra has introduced policies, 
provided specialized infrastructure, and offered other 
incentives to attract manufacturing & IT companies in Pune. 
This demand-led approach to economic development 
has been successful thus far. But to build economic 
resilience the city needs to concern, not with identifying or 
establishing markets alone, but have structures in place to 
be able to respond to market demands as they arise. 

Thus, Pune can benefit from bolstering its supply side 
infrastructure such as its skilling ecosystem, ease of doing 
business, and proactive economic planning to have a 
competitive advantage.

ACTION 3.1.1
Create a conducive environment for 
MSMEs to start, thrive, and expand to 
generate employment in the city

ACTION 3.1.2
Invest in skilling the workforce for 
growing and evolving needs of 
sectors

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

GOAL ENDORSED BY

ACTION 3.1.1
Create a conducive environment for MSMEs to start, thrive, and expand to 
generate employment in the city

Availability of resources and skilled labour, conducive 
business environment with strong buying capacity, ease 
of firm entry and exit, and geographic location with good 
regional connectivity have contributed to Pune having 
the highest number of MSMEs in Maharashtra State. 
However, the state economic survey has shown a decline 
in MSMEs between 2016-2018. While there is much scope 
for improvement in intra-city traffic management, reliable 
power and broadband services to boost enterprise growth, 
this decline is attributed to the rising cost of doing business, 
especially in auto manufacturing, and slower adoption of 
evolving technologies. 

Thus, for Pune to remain competitive, by MSMEs will need 
support in raising productivity, spurring innovation and 

building business capabilities. The city will also benefit from 
catalysing enterprise creation in newer clusters that leverage 
its core strengths in manufacturing-engineering (like low-
cost medical devices), and arts-culture (creative economy, 
tourism). With about 70% of Pune’s workforce participating 
in the informal sector, the city needs to make it easier for 
the informal self-employed to register their businesses, pay 
operating fees where necessary, as well as make taxation 
progressive and transparent. However, within those that are 
self-employed by choice, ‘choice entrepreneurs’, and not 
by necessity, will need support to start, grow and create 
jobs. Those that are self-employed out of need, ‘necessity 
entrepreneurs’, will need pathways for gainful employment.

Invest in skilling the workforce for growing and evolving needs of sectors

The Pune District skill-gap study conducted by National Skill 
Development Corporation (NSDC) forecasts that the district 
is likely to generate incremental demand/jobs for about 
2.85 million persons between 2012 and 2022. So as to create 
planned employment, it is essential to understand the skills 
demanded by projected job growth, and the current skill 
levels in supply in the region. 

The 811 colleges in the Pune urban region, the Pune 
Lighthouse program along with many other institutions in 
the city form a rich but disaggregated skilling ecosystem. 

Numerous stakeholders offer training programmes of varying 
standards with multiplicity in assessment and certification 
systems which are not comparable. These need to be 
consolidated and standardized across the urban region, and 
supplemented with strategic vocationalization of higher 
education. This vision is also in alignment with the national 
level transformation in which the government shifts from being 
a skills provider to a regulator, facilitated by a tech stack for 
local skilling ecosystems to plug into.

The productivity of Pune depends on a hybrid urban 
economy that comprises economic diversity i.e. formal and 
informal businesses and services. The informal workforce 
in Pune, constituting about 70% of total workforce, is more 
exposed to – and less protected against – common core 
contingencies such as illness, disability, and property loss, 
compared to formally engaged workers. The self-employed 
and non-standard employees are also particularly vulnerable 
to market fluctuations. Workers in the informal sector 
often struggle with the shocks and stresses of working in 
hazardous conditions, lack secure assets, basic infrastructure, 
and social services. They also operate with limited rights and 
inclusion as workers or citizens; thus perpetuating a cycle of 
poverty for them.

Thus for Pune to be more resilient, it has to support the 
economic rights of the working poor in the informal economy.

Ensure universal delivery of social protection, and improve government regulation 
& worker entitlements for informal work

ACTION 3.2.2
Improve women’s participation in paid work across income groups and education 
levels, to increase economic productivity and gender equity

Social protection is a policy instrument to reduce 
vulnerability, break intergenerational cycles of poverty, and 
foster social cohesion. The ILO highlights nine work-related 
contingencies that all workers should be protected against as 
a minimum – medical care, sickness benefit, unemployment 
benefit, old-age benefit, employment injury benefit, family 
benefit, maternity benefit, invalidity benefit, and survivors’ 
benefit. Extending these to informal workers is one way to 
support their transition from informal to formal economy. 
Universal coverage of contributory and tax-financed social 
protection measures are needed to boost coverage for these 
groups. But other delivery barriers must also be addressed, 
including lack of legal identification, limited awareness of 
programs, high opportunity costs to access them, and distrust 
or lack of familiarity with formal bureaucracies, especially 
since programs are operated under various city, state and 
national government departments. From the perspectives 
of government agencies, i.e the supply side, challenges 

include limited data and record keeping, especially of seasonal 
migrants. 

Workers belonging to industries that are poorly regulated 
or where enforcement is challenging (domestic work, 
construction, sanitation, transportation) may be further 
alienated from basic entitlements. The risks and regulations 
vary and need to be assessed individually and suitable 
regulations for each need to be developed and enforced. To do 
this, workers need to be able to organize themselves and have 
representation in institutions and processes that set policies 
and the ‘rules of the (economic) game’. Supporting the growth 
of their organizations, building capacity for leadership, policy 
advocacy, and collective bargaining – is both an end in itself – 
as informal workers achieve a sense of empowerment and are 
able to support each other, and a means to leveraging wider 
impact at the local, national and international levels. 

In India, only 27% of women do paid work, compared to 40% 
in South Asia. In fact, only 19% of skilled women participate in 
India’s workforce. More than in any other country, attitudes 
towards women’s responsibilities at home prevent them from 
entering the workplace. Indian women do six times as much 
housework as men – the least balanced ratio in the world. This 
means that those who do manage to juggle this work with a 
career face extreme time poverty. 

Apart from household chores, women are the primary 
caregivers for seniors and children. The burden is faced more 
severely in low-income households that are dependent on 
public healthcare and child care services. Long waiting times, 
high user fees and poor quality services mean they either do 

not seek out or do not have access to preventative care. When 
these public services are not available, it is women who take 
time away from work to care for the ill and young children, 
thus reducing their daily income and savings over the long-
term, potentially leading to debt as well. While improving 
access to and quality of public services is the bedrock of 
effective social protection policies, the city can also lead the 
way in professionalizing senior and child-care services for 
various incomes groups. This especially makes sense for Pune 
since it is a sought-after retirement destination.

A city like Pune, which is transitioning from an economy 
that has heavy reliance in a few sectors (like autos and 
IT), is at risk of falling behind if it is not able to adapt and 
innovate in new sectors especially in more high productivity 
services. For it to do this and support new and emerging 
sectors, it needs to be able constantly reinvent itself. In this 
new world, innovation, information, research, and creative 
industries are integral to staying ahead of long term trends. 
If Pune is to realise its potential in innovation and creativity, 
it will need to make investments in higher research and 
create a better enabling ecosystem for the same.

This goal focuses on reducing those barriers, setting up 
systems for information sharing, and making better use of 
Pune’s cultural and creative assets as part of its longterm 
economic resilience strategy.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

GOAL ENDORSED BY

ACTION 3.3.1
Create pathways for transfer of knowledge and technology between industries, 
research institutions, and universities

Research and innovation is important but ultimately holds 
its highest value when it is shared and flows freely between 
institutions where it can be practically used. This means 
creating better and stronger connections between industry, 
researchers, and universities. These institutions can be 
complementary but their different styles, goals, and personnel 
can be barriers for effective collaboration and for allowing 
businesses and individuals to translate new research into new 
products and services. In some Western countries like the 
United States, corporates reach out to universities/institutions 
to bring innovation into their work, while in India, corporates 
and industry bodies rely mostly on their own research. Thus 
there needs to be the right incentives and mechanisms for 
such collaboration to take place. 

While Pune is an educational hub and has several industrial 
clusters like pharma, IT, and auto, it has not contributed to 
its full potential towards research and innovation. Compared 
to cities like Bengaluru, Koltaka, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and 
Hyderabad, Pune lags behind in research and professional 
practice indicators of - number and quality of publications, 
number of patents filed, and footprint of projects and 
professional practices. Thus Pune needs to focus on developing 
its R&D with public-private partnerships, strengthen university 
incubation centers and their linkages with MSMEs and 
industry sectors, focus on outcome-based research, faculty 
development programmes, and improve cognitive learning in 
schools.

Promote collection, storage and dissemination of quality open-data, in a privacy-
emboldening way

In Pune, like other cities across India, data that is collected 
is siloed and often not shared, leading to a fragmented data 
landscape that exacerbates information gaps. Data is also 
collected in formats that are not functional for analytical 
purposes, and especially lack visualizations that can otherwise 
help recognize spatial and temporal trends; resulting in 
inaction or delayed action. Though Pune has created an open 
data platform and appointed a Chief Data Officer, compliance 
of various departments needs to be enforced with adequate 
training and capacity building.

Further, the global question of data-privacy demands a 
national adoption of data protection regulation which makes 
data sharing to be done in a privacy-friendly way; where the 
capability to trace the data to individuals is made through 
‘anonymisation’. This should in no way shift away from the 
agenda of open-data, which is – to raise transparency and 
accountability, to gauge the performance of public authorities, 
contribute to choices in policymaking, and spur research and 
innovation.

Pune helped inform outreach and selection of startups and 
other potential tech participants. Pune has taken up Solid Waste 
Management as a problem statement, for which select startups
