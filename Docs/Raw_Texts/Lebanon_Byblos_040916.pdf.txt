RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURE

LETTER FROM MAYOR ZIAD HAWAT

Dear friends, 

It is with great pride that I present to you Byblos’ Resilience Strategy, a strategy 
for a contemporary city, drawing on elements of our past and present to guide us 
toward a vision for a resilient future. 

Byblos is a city of tradition as well as modernity; diverse but also peaceful and 
united. We treasure our past – its customs, traditions, and culture – but that 
doesn’t mean we’re fixed in time. As much as we value our heritage, we know 
that maintaining our unique society requires effort and even change to guide us 
toward a balanced and resilient future. 

This strategy charts our journey toward that goal and provides a vision for 
Byblos in which our natural assets are integrated with urban development, new 
partnerships are created to foster a thriving multi-sector economy, and traditions 
are protected and honored. The strategy sets out the actions we’ll take to ensure 
we meet the targets we’re setting for ourselves, and provides a robust framework 
for strategic planning and governance. 

The strategy acknowledges the social, economic and environmental challenges we 
face, and recommends practical, achievable solutions to ensure Byblos remains a 
reflective, inclusive and innovative city in which social cohesion, cultural diversity 
and local identity meet and merge for the benefit of everyone who lives in and 
visits the city.

Resilience building is a dynamic process that requires input from everyone in the 
city, I hope you’ll join me on this exciting journey.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURELETTER FROM THE CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER

In December 2013, the city of Byblos was selected as one of the very first 
100 Resilient Cities (100RC). 100RC is the brainchild of The Rockefeller Foundation 
and is now evolving into an influential global network of cities, of which we are 
proud to be a part.

We are grateful to the 100RC President Michael Berkowitz, the Vice President 
for Relationships Bryna Lipper, the Regional Manager Cristiana Fragola, and 
our Relationship Manager Scott Rosenstein for their inspiration and continuous 
encouragement on our resilience journey.

We are also highly appreciative of the support we have received from Mayor Ziad 
Hawat, along with the rest of the staff and members of the municipality. 

The development of the strategy has been a fascinating process, involving 
research, brainstorming, stakeholder engagement, data collection and analysis, 
and much more. The final strategy is the culmination of months of hard work and 
dedication by many highly motivated people, not least my assistant and lead 
writer Ms. Tania Kallab, as well as engineer and reviewer Eng. Anthony Sfeir. 

Special thanks go to the Steering Committee, Mrs Alice Eddé, and our local 
consultants: Ms. Roula Haidar, Ms. Maya Karkour from EcoConsulting, Mr. Adib 
Dada and his team from theOtherDada, and Prof. Eleish SD from Organization De 
Developpement Durable (ODDD).

We also gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the academic experts who 
have supported the Byblos municipality: Dr. Rashid Chamoun, Dr. Tony Lahoud, 
Dr Joseph Kyprianos, and Dr. José Manuel Madrigal from the Lebanese American 
University (LAU), Dr Elsy Ibrahim and Notre Dame University (NDU).

Special regards also go to our Strategic Partner, the Arup team: Paula Kirk, Dima 
Zogheib, Laura Frost, and Johnny Ojeil.

Finally, we’d like to thank Ms. Nathalie Zaarour and her assistant Karine Zoghby 
from the UNDP, in addition to all of our local stakeholder representatives including 
NGOs, associations, members of the private sector, and government officials, 
as well as Ms. Najwa Soueidan, and the special needs organization Ms. Sylvana 
Lakkis, whose participation in workshops had an extremely positive effect on the 
strategy.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURELETTER FROM 100 RESILIENT CITIES

100 Resilient Cities is honored to partner with the City of Byblos to release the 
first resilience strategy in the Middle East from the first office of resilience in the 
region. This marks the beginning of an extraordinary journey for this incredible 
Lebanese city as it continues to build its reputation as a global leader in resilience 
planning.

First and foremost, this would not have happened without the vision and passion 
of Mayor Ziad Hawat. Tony Sfeir, the Chief Resilience Officer, and his extraordinary 
support team led by Tania Kallab have gone above and beyond the call of duty 
to produce this visionary document. Arup’s technical support was instrumental in 
guiding this process.

Building urban resilience requires recognizing the interplay of a city’s strengths, 
weaknesses, shocks, and stresses. It is also about bolstering the foundation of a 
city so that it can respond to new, unforeseen events, and help a city function in 
good times and bad.

For Byblos, this resilience building journey involves navigating a complicated 
regional landscape. But at the core of this journey is the city’s history and 
identity, which inspires great affection from both visitors and residents. This has 
a significant impact on the economic, social, and environmental fabric of the city. 
The need for an integrated approach to decision-making is therefore an essential 
component of the prosperity, stability, and sustainability of Byblos.

This strategy, which is the result of many months of research, outreach, 
introspection, and analysis, looks to identify a road-map for the future. It identifies 
a range of goals and actions that will address the above-mentioned interplay of 
challenges and opportunities.

100 Resilient Cities is committed to working with the city of Byblos in the 
coming years to implement the vision laid out in this strategy. Through the 
100RC Platform of Partners – a powerful cadre of public, private, non-profit, and 
academic sector partners – we will bring many resources to this partnership. 
Unlocking this support and signaling a growing marketplace that is interested in 
working with cities that incorporate resilience thinking into their planning process 
is a key tenet of the 100RC philosophy. This partnership and strategy is just the 
beginning!

Sincerely, 

MICHAEL BERKOWITZ

President, 100 Resilient Cities

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREINTRODUCTION

About 100 Resilient Cities 

About the City Resilience Framework 

The City Resilience Framework provides a lens 
through which the complexity of cities and the 
numerous factors that contribute to a city’s 
resilience can be understood. It comprises 4 
dimensions and 12 key drivers.

100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the 
Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) is dedicated to 
helping cities around the world become more 
resilient to the physical, social and economic 
challenges that are a growing part of the 
21st century. 100RC supports the adoption 
and incorporation of a view of resilience that 
includes not just the shocks – earthquakes, fires, 
floods, etc. – but also the stresses that weaken 
the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical 
basis.  By addressing both the shocks and the 
stresses, a city becomes more able to respond 
to adverse events, and is overall better able to 
deliver basic functions in both good times and 
bad, to all populations. 

"CITY RESILIENCE DESCRIBES THE CAPACITY OF CITIES TO 
FUNCTION, SO THAT THE PEOPLE LIVING AND WORKING IN 
CITIES – PARTICULARLY THE POOR AND VULNERABLE – SURVIVE 
AND THRIVE NO MATTER WHAT STRESSES OR SHOCKS THEY 
ENCOUNTER".

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURE

City Resilience Framework

About this strategy

The strategy comprises the work that the city 
team has done to date.

The strategy sets out the vision for our city, 
the challenges, the strategic pillars, goals and 
actions to pursue and achieve this vision.

current and future shocks and stresses could 
aﬀ ect the city and identifi ed which assets are 
already providing resilience as well as those in 
need of strengthening. At the end of Phase I, we 
identifi ed 5 Focus Areas which went on to form 
the basis of the fi nal Resilience Strategy.  

We believe that local ownership of the strategy 
is critical to its long-term adoption and success. 
To guarantee that outcome, we’ve made sure 
to include city stakeholders from a variety 
of disciplines and backgrounds including 
the municipality, private sector, academic 
community and NGOs. 

Phase I of the strategy process aimed to 
produce a vision for resilient Byblos based on 
assessments of the current state of resilience 
in Byblos and the challenges and opportunities 
facing the city. Working with our academic 
partners from LAU, alongside stakeholders from 
the Advisory Group, and a range of other public 
and private sector groups. We explored how 

In Phase II, we delved more deeply into the 
opportunities identifi ed in Phase I, using the 
Resilience Lens tool to prioritize opportunities 
based on how, and to what extent they 
contribute to resilience over the short and 
longer terms. From this we produced a number 
of actions to be carried forward and practically 
implemented – these are the main output of the 
strategy document.

OBSERVING OUR CHALLENGES 
Oil spillage, 2006

While the past conflicts in Lebanon have not directly 
affected the peace of Byblos, our environment and 
economy have been deeply damaged. In 2006, the Old 
port, rocks and beaches of Byblos were polluted by a 
2 centimeter thick oil slick following the Israeli bombing of 
storage tanks at the Jiyyeh power station south of Beirut. 
Short term damages included severe damage to the 
marine life, disruption to the fishing and tourism industry, 
and severe stains to the archaeological remains. The long-
term damage to the city’s natural environment could not 
be quantified.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURE

BYBLOS RESILIENCE PROFILE

Byblos is a coastal city vulnerable to numerous 
shocks and stresses – physical, environmental, 
economic, societal and political – that will affect the 
city’s assets. Over the last few years, the city has 
been implementing actions to mitigate our known 
risks. Now, in the face of additional challenges facing 
our city, country and region, we need to do more. 

Our challenges:

A fragmented city is not a resilient city

Our environment is changing

For Byblos, preservation of peace is fundamental to our future 
ability to survive and thrive

Loss of customs, traditional businesses and know-hows threaten 
our city’s heritage

Our economy requires diversification

A fragmented city is not a resilient city

Historically, Byblos was a small coastal town, with 
2,000 inhabitants. It was a human scale city, low rise, 
and compact, with a balance of open space. The city 
itself consisted of a small fishing harbor that was 
the regional and commercial hub for the caza. The 
Old City remains at this human scale, but the wider 
city has expanded to accommodate the growing 
population. The city expanded up the hills in an 
uncontrolled and unregulated pattern of development 
with less community focus, which has led to a 
reduction in social cohesion and interaction, and a 
loss of accessibility around the city. Urban sprawl has 
affected both the physical and social structure of 
the city. Today, the city is fragmented; a major road 
cuts the city in half, and part of the infrastructure 
cannot cope with the network demand of travel. This 
is due to the reliance on the car as mode of transport.  
Improving accessibility and linkages around the city is 
a particular challenge.

Our environment is changing

Byblos is a city rich in natural heritage, which includes 
a diverse coastline, river valleys, beaches, orchards, 
agricultural land, and the surrounding hillside 
woodlands. These features contribute to the beauty 
of the city and its setting, and offer valuable services. 
However, they are under threat from urban growth 
and human intervention. Rapid population growth, 
rural-urban migration, unplanned urbanization and 
unregulated construction is causing encroachment of 
developments into river valleys and the surrounding 
landscape along with pollution of rivers and aquifers 
with waste and sewage and occasional droughts 
due to rising water demands. This is coupled with 
the absence of appropriate infrastructure such as a 
waste water treatment plant. Recently the situation 
has been aggravated by the waste management 
crisis in the country and in Hbaline landfill site, and 
the absence of a national integrated and sustainable 
waste management strategy. Regular power cuts have 
increased the demand for private generators, which 
are polluting our air. Protecting the environment is 
critical for our resilience.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREFor Byblos, preservation of peace is 
fundamental to our future ability to 
survive and thrive

Loss of customs, traditional businesses 
and know-hows threaten our city’s 
heritage

Peace has long been a characteristic of Byblos, and it 
remains a strong value of the city’s citizens. However, 
with rapid population growth, internal migration 
and an influx of refugees from Syria, maintenance 
of social cohesion is a growing challenge. 1.5 million 
Syrian refugees have recently sheltered in Lebanon; 
a country whose own population is just 4 million. 
The region is threatened by armed conflicts resulting 
from injustice, oppression, lack of freedom, radical 
ideologies, ruthless dictatorship and religious 
extremism. Regional instability is accelerating an 
existing economic crisis and escalating problems of 
unemployment. 

Byblos’ rich archaeology is nothing less than an 
open air museum, with sites and artefacts dating 
back to the early days of the city. Fishing, crafts 
and other traditional businesses are being replaced 
by more profitable activities. Cultural customs and 
traditions are being diluted or forgotten due to 
lack of education, youth migration, and changing 
demographics. If this erosion of cultural heritage is 
not curbed, Byblos will lose the reason why so many 
visitors are attracted to the city in the first place. For 
Byblos, preservation of historical assets and culture, 
and revival of customs and crafts is an important 
aspect of resilience. 

According to UN statistics in December 2014, 
the latest number of registered Syrian refugees 
in Lebanon is 1,158,995. In the caza of Byblos, the 
statistics compiled on the 30th of April 2015 show 
a total of 1,660 registered refugees in a population 
of 27,250. The percentage increase since the initial 
registrations in September 2013 compared to an 
estimate of a 1% yearly growth rate, is thought to 
challenge Byblos’ population growth rate.

Our economy requires diversification

The ancient city had a variety of economic activities 
such as fishing and agriculture. Today, the economy 
relies mainly on tourism, retail and health. Regional 
unrest, migration of young people (brain drain), 
shifting economies, growing unemployment and the 
decline of traditional trades are having an impact on 
the economic prosperity and resilience of the city, 
and its attractiveness to investors.  Steering economic 
growth and economic diversity are of particular 
importance for our city’s resilience.

OBSERVING OUR CHALLENGES 
‘Zina’ Storm, 2015

In January 2015, a powerful winter storm swept across 
Lebanon, creating strong winds reaching 100Km/hour 
together with high waves and heavy rain. The storm caused 
an infrastructure collapse. In Byblos, the storm threatened 
our Old port, archaeological site, and affected some of the 
businesses. The storm lasted a few days and it was reported 
as an extraordinary event for Lebanon, unlike any weather 
conditions experienced for a long time.

The launch was held at the 
Cultural Center in Byblos, bringing 
together city stakeholders from 
the municipal government, private 
sector, academia and civil society. 
The objective of the launch was to 
introduce the resilience strategy 
development process and publicly 
launch the strategy by the Mayor 
of Byblos.

Agenda Setting Workshop 
represented the first significant 
opportunity for 100 Resilience 
Cities to engage the Byblos 
municipal government and key 
stakeholders following the city's 
selection. The workshop primary 
function was to start a dialogue 
between 100 Resilient Cities 
and key stakeholders on Byblos' 
resilience context, shocks and 
stresses and interdependencies. 
Stakeholders included Byblos 
Municipal Council leader, 
government ministries, police, 
NGOs, academic institutions, and 
civic societies.

Resilience Diagnostic and 
Assessment
To better understand the physical, 
social and economic risks facing 
Byblos, we carried out a Resilience 
Diagnostic where we have 
developed diagnostic questions 
to further research our Focus 
Areas to identify opportunities 
that the city can take to improve 
its resilience. The group of all 
the opportunities is the Field of 
Opportunities.

Identification of Focus Areas 
Five key themes and focus areas 
emerged from the PRA; these 
illustrate the priority areas of focus 
for the resilient strategy: 

•  Regulate urban development 
and improve accessibility and 
linkages of the city

•  Understand and respect 

environmental limits

•  Preserve the peacefulness of the 

city

•  Preserve historical assets, and 

protect and revive customs and 
traditions

•  Promote and maintain economic 

diversity

Development of City Resilience 
Strategy
To develop an integrated strategy 
that underpins the city’s vision, 
goals, and actions.

The Mayor's Pledge

100RC Mayors’ Pledge

Byblos agreed to commit at 
least 10% of the annual city 
budget in support of delivering 
resilience initiatives. This will help 
to fund the actions outlined in 
this strategy, and support us to 
access further funding by showing 
our commitment to building 
our resilience. In return for this 
commitment, 100RC will provide 
the city with up to $5 million worth 
of goods and services from service 
providers (Platform Partners) over 
the next five years.

1. A CONNECTED CITY: BYBLOS 
WILL BE A CITY THAT PIONEERS 
INNOVATIVE AND INCLUSIVE URBAN 
SOLUTIONS

Our understanding of a Resilient Byblos is 
anchored in multidisciplinary and integrated urban 
strategies that promote innovative, responsive and 
sustainable interventions in our city to encourage 
economic development, ecosystem and resource 
management, preservation of cultural and natural 
heritage, and a good quality of life for all.

Our city is suffering from urban sprawl, uncontrolled 
construction and a fragmented urban form, which are 
largely the outcomes of three events: 

•  The construction of the highway linking Beirut 

to Tripoli, which improved access to the city 
but also contributed to population growth and 
split the city into two parts, resulting in growth 
and physical expansion eastwards up the hills, 
transforming the Old City into a marginal section 
of the greater Byblos. Another wide road was 
also built linking the Old City to the upper 
mountain villages, which further bisected the city 
from north to south.

•  The 1972 city masterplan – the last masterplan 

proposed for the city – preserved the Old City at 
the expense of unrestricted development in other 
zones, leading to uncontrolled sprawl. 

GOAL A: BUILD OUR DIGITAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE

Goal objective: Our city suffers from a lack 
of data about the people and assets we have, 
and how we are changing. We are in the digital 
age, where data is crucial in informing decision-
making and building more sustainable and 
resilient cities. We want to improve our city's 
measurement capability, in order to improve our 
management.

ONGOING ACTION: 1. COLLECT AND MANAGE 
DATA

Action description: The difficulty in finding and 
acquiring data is pushing us to design a brand 
new  data collection and management system, with 
support from national agencies and our Platform 
Partner ESRI. As part of working toward a consistent 
database, we will:

•  The Lebanese civil war, which led to significant 

1.  Design our own conceptual data model for 

migration from war torn areas of the country 
to peaceful metropolitan Byblos, leading to 
population growth. The increased demand for 
housing, intensified the pace of construction, and 
put additional strain on the city’s infrastructure.  

All have a role to play in what the city suffers today. 
We need to move toward a more integrated and 
cohesive urban form. We need improved data about 
the city and its growth to inform better urban 
management. And we need to curb the ongoing 
urban sprawl. 

Our work on urban development is integrated with 
each of our other goals. Through the way we plan 
and manage our built environment, we will seek to 
progress toward better management of our natural 
environment, more cohesive communities, protected 
and enhanced cultural heritage, and a more holistic 
approach to economic growth.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREWE WILL:

•  Build our digital infrastructure
•  Connect our city’s neighborhoods and limit urban sprawl
•  Design our blue-green network

GOAL B: CONNECT OUR CITY’S 
NEIGHBORHOODS AND LIMIT 
URBAN SPRAWL

Goal objective: One of the major issues in all the 
coastal Lebanese cities is the road that was built 
to connect and facilitate access to the capital 
Beirut. The highway split Byblos into two parts; 
the Old City (west) and the new city (east). 
The voie romaine (decumanus) divides the city 
further into north and south. Four parts of the 
city converge in a major vehicular roundabout at 
the geographic center of the city. A fragmented 
city is not a resilient city. We want to improve 
connectivity across our neighborhoods, and curb 
the ongoing trend of unregulated development, 
which is expanding our city into the hills, leading 
to traffic congestion, obstruction of major view 
corridors, and development of the remaining 
natural landscape. 

In the longer term, we may find opportunities to 
further enhance our digital infrastructure with the use 
of satellite imagery and other assets.

ASPIRATIONAL ACTION: 2. OPEN BYBLOS’ 
DATA FOR PUBLIC USE

 

Action description: Once we have our digital 
infrastructure place and a robust approach to data 
collection and maintenance, we want to pioneer 
the open data initiative in Lebanon by opening 
our data for anyone to access, use or share. Open 
data stores across different cities around the world 
have generated multiple benefits for the economy, 
community and to help cities address their challenges 
through innovative digital solutions. This will help 
collaboration between citizens and Municipality to 
plan for a better city and quality of life for all. It will 
also help the Municipality to direct its resources 
where they are needed most through a better 
understanding of the extent of city challenges, such 
as traffic congestion, parking availability, or water 
leaks. With support from our Platform Partners ESRI 
and Khatib & Alami, we will create an online data 
store for public access.

PRIORITY ACTION: 1. SYNTHESIZE EXISTING 
MOBILITY PLANS AND TRANSPORT 
RESEARCH TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
AN INTEGRATED MOBILITY PLAN

Action description: We aim to synthesize and assess 
all the transport studies done to date toward the 
development of an integrated multimodal mobility 
plan that not only responds to the spatial challenges 
that Byblos is facing, but also addresses the problems 
of the lack of basic fixed infrastructure such as

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREsidewalks, safe pedestrian crossing points and 
signage. This is a particular issue along some of our 
main roads, including ‘Voie 13’ in the new city, and at 
the roundabout. There is a need in Byblos to improve 
transportation on different levels: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Improving walkability and introducing pedestrian 
streets, particularly connecting the east and west 
parts of the city.
Improving the public transportation system, 
which is currently limited to small electric buses 
in the Old City and a main bus route along the 
highway between Tripoli and Beirut, with no other 
access around the city apart from by car.
Introducing cycling paths to promote active, 
sustainable travel and recreation, particularly 
along the coast. 
Integration of car parking with public 
transportation.

•  Policy led multi-modal strategy.

A group of students led by ODDD has started a 
transport initiative entitled Toward a Sustainable 
Mediterranean City: Byblos sustainable transportation 
policies, to understand and address the transport 
issues Byblos is suffering from. 

We want to create a safer and more inclusive mobility 
network for our citizens and reduce urban sprawl by 
redirecting growth along planned corridors, and will 
be supported by an integrated zoning plan for the 
city. We want to set a precedent that other coastal 
cities in Lebanon can follow. 

Action objective: Improve transport linkages across 
all parts of the city, promoting safer streets, offering 
residents and visitors different modes of transport to 
move around, and creating an exemplar city for other 
Lebanese coastal cities to learn from. 

Action owner: Byblos Municipality

Action partners: Transport advisors,  ODDD

Timeline: Medium term 

Resilience value: 

• 

Improved connection between communities, key 
services and places of work

•  Safer streets and neighborhoods
•  Environmental improvements, including air quality 

and provision of green spaces

•  Reduction of urban sprawl and redirection of 

urban growth

•  Reduction of travel congestion, which can boost 

economic activity

• 

• 

Improved health and wellbeing associated with 
walking and cycling
Improved social interaction via use of public 
transport.

ACTION: 2. CREATE PEDESTRIAN LINKS 
BETWEEN THE OLD (WEST), NEW (EAST) 
PARTS OF THE CITY AND NORTH-SOUTH.

Description: Pedestrian linkages across the 
distributary road and roundabout are crucial to 
improve connectivity between the old and new city, to 
encourage residents to walk between the two parts of 
the city instead of going by car, and to reintegrate the 
Old City into the modern Byblos. Design proposals for 
linkages include creation of an elevated public space 
across the road and roundabout, connecting the Voie 
Romaine with the new municipality headquarters 
and extending up to the eastern part of the city. 
Combining this major action with more regular and 
safe pedestrian crossings, footpaths, cycling routes, 
will enable the whole city to be navigated by foot 
and connected east-west, north-south. An integrated 
pedestrian plan will form part of the overall mobility 
plan for the city, of which we expect some of these 
specific interventions to be part.

SHOWCASING BEST PRACTICE
The natural wastewater treatment systems in Remhala, 
Lebanon use the dense roots of local canes (Arundo donax) 
to fix bacteria and remove pollutants from the water. The 
system relies on gravitational force alone to move the water 
from one stage to the next. The process starts with waste 
water passing through a sedimentation tank where all solid 
particles are removed to leave a homogeneous effluent. This 
flows through a primary followed by a secondary purification 
‘station’ or container filled with the cane roots. The two 
purification stations are linked to improve the treatment 
level and regulate flow speeds. Integration also increases the 
system capacity by allowing the effluent to move into the 
second station once the first is saturated. Fresh water then 
flows out of the system ready to be reused without harming 
in the environment.

ACTION: 2. IDENTIFY WASTEWATER 
SOLUTION FOR THE OLD CITY

Description: For the Old City, separate wastewater 
treatment solutions are to be explored, since it will 
not be possible to build sub-surface wastewater pipes 
in this archeologically rich area. Wastewater solutions 
for this part of the city will take into consideration the 
sensitivity of the site. We are investigating alternative 
small scale sewage treatment plants to be installed in 
restaurants, and the use of natural treatment solutions 
which uses plant material to filter wastewater to safe 
standards. The Old City can become a model and a 
research center for universities showcasing innovative 
wastewater solutions within a historic center.

and Reconstruction (CDR)

Action partners: Byblos Municipality, Veolia, Union of 
Municipalities.

GOAL C: DESIGN A BLUE-GREEN 
NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE 
CITY

Goal objective: Urban sprawl, unregulated 
development, drought and other shocks 
and stresses have caused our open spaces, 
agricultural land, private gardens, woodlands, 
rivers and other water courses to be 
marginalized or removed. We want to bring 
these natural assets back to create a greener, 
cleaner and healthier urban environment. 

ACTION: 1. BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE 
NEW CITY TO CONNECT THE CITY USERS TO 
THE TREATMENT PLANT

Description: To further resolve our wastewater 
issues, the solutions for the old and new city will 
be addressed differently. For the new city, we have 
a wastewater treatment plant that is already built, 
but lacks infrastructure connections to the houses 
and buildings. Planning and building the required 
infrastructure through a well-maintained sewage 
network is important for our resilience. We are 
collaborating with our 100RC Platform Partner ESRI, 
and Veolia to examine how this can be done.

SHOWCASING EVOLVING 
PRACTICE 
The Beirut River LESS strategy aims to bring the Beirut river 
back to life. The Beirut river extends 30km from its source in 
the mountains, through peri-urban and urban areas, into the 
Mediterranean sea. The river in the early 1990s was a natural 
flowing river with diverse natural river banks and agricultural 
land, today it flows in a hard engineered channel throughout 
most of the urban areas, with little or no water flowing. The 
river suffers from dumping of sewage, wastewater, garbage, 
industrial waste, and slaughter house waste which then all flow 
into the Mediterranean sea. The deterioration of the river is 
having negative impacts on the economy of the surrounding 
neighborhoods, the communities and the environment. ‘This is 
a local problem with a global impact’, as the design lead of this 
initiative puts it. The initiative proposes to address these issues 
through community engagement, collaborative partnerships, 
stormwater management and restoration of lost ecosystems.

ASPIRATIONAL ACTION: 3. REHABILITATE THE 
MAIN STREAM, NAHR JAJ

Description: Nahr jaj is one of the streams that cuts 
across the old and new parts of the city. The stream 
is currently culverted under the city’s roads. We 
propose to open up the river, also known as ‘stream 
daylighting’, to rehabilitate the natural system, 
improve drainage and create a green ecological 
corridor for people and wildlife. The stream will also 
contribute to improving connections between the 
two parts of the city, the old and the new. Raising 
awareness of these forgotten streams is key to 
retaining a sense of our natural heritage in Byblos.

STRATEGY

Description: Developing an urban greening strategy 
sets a framework for protecting and restoring existing 
green open spaces, limiting urban sprawl, and 
providing context for the city’s future planning. The 
aim is to adopt a holistic and integrated ecological 
landscape planning methodology that addresses our 
city’s challenges, and integrate them with our blue 
network (rivers, stormwater management etc.) to 
create multifunctional opportunities for economic 
development, amenity and recreation.  The strategy 
will play a crucial role in connecting our city’s 
neighborhoods through a series of green corridors.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURE2. A RESOURCEFUL CITY: BYBLOS 
WILL BE A RESOURCE EFFICIENT 
CITY THAT OPTIMIZES ECOSYSTEM 
SERVICES

Our approach to managing Byblos’ natural 
environment and ecosystems is one that looks for 
synergies in approaches to address our priority 
issues. This draws on multidisciplinary contributions 
to limit anthropogenic pollution, protect natural 
habitats and encourage sustainable local practices 
of resource use. 

Some of the environmental challenges that we face, 
such as coastal flooding and the sand storm we 
experienced in 2015, are outside of our direct control 
so our focus must be to prepare ourselves for such 
extreme events. Our preparations are outlined under 
other goals with respect to specific measures to 
protect our people and cultural heritage. This goal 
therefore focuses on the environmental stresses that 
are within our control, which include the difficulties of 
managing our solid waste, the air quality issues that 
stem from reliance on back-up diesel generators for 
reliable energy supply, and the responsible behaviors 
of our citizens toward the natural environment. 

Our work to preserve our environment is intrinsically 
linked to our practices of urban development, and 
should be considered in tandem with the goals 
outlined in Strategic Pillar 1. Our view is that a unified 
approach to sustainable behaviors by all of our 
citizens will generate social cohesion and a sense of 
wellbeing (Strategic Pillar 4), and new environmental 
management practices could be a catalyst for 
economic diversification (Strategic Pillar 5).

26

GOAL A: DEMONSTRATE 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
RESPONSIBILITY AND PROMOTE 
STEWARDSHIP BY CITIZENS

Goal objective: To establish sustainable 
waste management practices and collection 
schemes within the city of Byblos, which 
protect us from the waste management crises 
experienced in other parts of Lebanon. To raise 
environmental awareness amongst Byblos 
citizens, engage the youth and local community 
in sustainability-oriented initiatives, and foster 
a deeper understanding and civic responsibility 
toward natural resources and our supporting 
ecosystems.

PRIORITY ACTION: 1. WORK WITH THE 
UNION OF MUNICIPALITIES TO INTRODUCE 
SANITARY WASTE TREATMENT AND A WASTE 
SEGREGATION PLANT IN HBALINE

Description: The first step of this initiative requires 
an assessment of the condition and usability of the 
existing waste management infrastructure that serves 
Byblos. This consists of an uncontrolled landfill site 
in the village of Hbaline, which receives waste from 
all municipalities in the Caza of Byblos. Identifying 
opportunities to introduce sanitary controls at the 
site will be critical to limit environmental damage, 
particularly as our population grows and an 
increasing volume of untreated waste is disposed in 
Hbaline. As we develop options to improve the site, 
we also have the opportunity to consider proposals to 
introduce other infrastructure that will support more 
sustainable waste management for Byblos and our 
neighboring municipalities. A waste segregation plant 
will be critical to our ability to reduce the volume of 
waste we send to landfill and ensure that our reusable 
and recyclable waste streams can be diverted. With 
the help of our partner, Veolia, we will be able to 
determine best practice strategies for improving 
the Hbaline site and establishing appropriate waste 
collection and separation strategies for the city. 

Action objective: To put in place effective 
infrastructure for sustainable waste management, 
enabling us to reduce the environmental impact 
of our solid waste and generate new economic 
opportunities related to material reuse and recycling.

•  Reduces environmental damages caused by the 

Hbaline landfill site

•  Reduces risks to human health due to the landfill
•  Reduces the future cost of environmental clean-

up and regeneration of the Hbaline site

•  Raise awareness and active participation in waste 

reduction and recycling within the community

•  Enables Byblos to generate economic value from 

“waste” materials through reuse and recycling
•  Enables Byblos to reduce the volume of waste 

sent to landfill

•  Creates new economic activity and employment 

through services related to reuse and recycling

•  Positions Byblos as a proactive, responsible and 

sustainable city, particularly following the 2015 
waste crisis in Lebanon

 

ONGOING ACTION: 2. PROVIDE SEGREGATED 
WASTE BINS IN PUBLIC PLACES 
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

Description: Following the identification of an 
appropriate waste recycling plant and collection 
scheme for Byblos, we will introduce segregated 
waste bins throughout the city to encourage 
citizens to separate their waste streams at source. 
This will be an important way to divert waste from 
landfills, reduce litter around the city, and raise 
public awareness of sustainable waste practices. 
To maximize the benefits, it will be essential to 
strategically design and locate the bins. We will use 
international best practices to apply color coding, 
symbols and shaped openings (e.g. rectangular slit 
for paper, round opening for glass and plastics) that 
can be easily recognized and understood. Bins will 
be concentrated in areas with high pedestrian flow, 
for example near cafes and restaurants, shopping 
precincts and festival venues. 

Action owner: Byblos Municipality

CHALLENGE IN CONTEXT 
Waste management crisis in Lebanon

Waste management in Lebanon is a municipal responsibility, 
however the municipal budget was given to a private 
company Sukleen to manage the waste in Lebanon. In 
July 2015, Beirut’s largest landfill site was shut down as it 
has exceeded its capacity limits. Without alternatives, and 
without support from the community, the government was 
paralyzed in finding solutions. Garbage was piling up on the 
streets of all Lebanese cities, some dumped under bridges, 
in the river valleys and forests. To make things worse, some 
municipalities and citizens started burning the garbage 
causing additional damage to the environment and air 
quality. The crisis has instigated a number of civil society 
movements and protests to urgently address sustainable 
waste management and avoid health impacts.

ONGOING ACTION: 3. STIPULATE WASTE 
sector waste collection, recycling, reuse and 
SEGREGATION FOR ALL RESTAURANT 
composting companies and NGOs.
ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE OLD CITY

Description: Following the identification of an 
appropriate waste recycling plant and collection 
scheme for Byblos, all restaurants in the Old City of 
Byblos will be required to sort and recycle their waste, 
with a long-term plan to expand recycling to other 
restaurants in Byblos. The first step, which can be 
implemented immediately, is to reduce organic waste 
generation by donating excess food to restaurant 
staff, elderly homes, orphanages and NGOs that care 
for refugees. Liability being the main impediment to 
such an initiative, it will be the shared responsibility 
of giving and receiving parties to ensure that food 
is fit for consumption. Later, each restaurant will be 
required to introduce a proper implementation plan 
to segregate glass, cans, plastics and organic waste 
for recycling and composting. 

Action owner: Byblos Municipality

Potential Action partners: Environmental 
consultancies and NGOs such as Lebanese 
Food Bank, FoodBlessed, Cedar Environmental, 
EcoConsulting, private sector waste collection, reuse, 
recycling and composting companies. 

ONGOING ACTION: 4. ESTABLISH 
ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS PROGRAMS

Description: We will organize a variety of 
environmental education initiatives in the schools 
and universities of Byblos to establish sustainable 
behaviors in our young people. At school level, all 
students will participate in at least one interactive 
environmental education class and waste awareness 
session, such as a play, presentation or discussions 
around environmental themes. Other activities 
could include hands-on gardening, painting and 
environmental graffiti by students in derelict areas 
of the city, which would have an added benefit of 
helping to uplift the neighborhoods and encourage 
community engagement. 

In universities, we will look to establish youth 
exchange programs between Byblos university 
students and a model European city; by spending 
time in cities where green behaviors are the norm, 
students will become more aware of sustainable 
lifestyles. The promotion of environmental societies in 
universities will also be encouraged, including inter- 
and intra-university competitions on environmental 
themes, such as sustainable design, mobility, etc. 
Competition winners may be announced in public 
events in Byblos, showcasing good sustainable ideas 
to the local community.

SHOWCASING BEST PRACTICE
The Green Glass Recycling Initiative Lebanon (GGRIL) is an 
initiative led by environmental entrepreneur, Ziad Abichaker, 
in response to the need for a recycling outlet for green glass 
bottles in Lebanon following the destruction of the only 
green glass manufacturing plant during the July 2006 war. 
When the initiative commenced in November 2013, 71 million 
bottles per year were being dumped in Lebanon’s landfills or 
forests, and the country’s traditional glassblowing industry 
was facing closure. Ziad began collecting green bottles for 
use in a glassblowing workshop south of Beirut, and started 
working with the glassblowers to develop new designs and 
improve access to markets. To date, it is estimated that 
over 180,000 green bottles have been diverted from landfill, 
helping to revive a declining industry and generate new 
economic value from waste glass.

SEGREGATION

Description: Following establishment of recycling 
infrastructure and a recycling plan for Byblos, we will 
encourage the establishment of a green committee 
in every neighborhood, residential complex or 
apartment building in the city. The committees will 
have a responsibility to raise awareness about the 
need to segregate and recycle waste streams, and 
will monitor the correct segregation of waste at the 
building level to ensure that waste streams remain 
clean enough for recycling. Green committees will be 
linked with neighborhood committees, as outlined in 
Goal 3.

companies to be identified.

GOAL B: INVEST IN EFFICIENT 
AND RENEWABLE ENERGY

Goal objective: To reduce the city’s exposure to 
power outages and reliance on polluting fossil 
fuels.

ASPIRATIONAL ACTION: 1. PREPARE A 
STRATEGY FOR AN EFFICIENT, RELIABLE AND 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SUPPLY TO REDUCE 
DEPENDENCY ON THE NATIONAL GRID

Description: Lebanon experiences major electricity 
supply issues, with hours of power outages each day. 
The country relies heavily on energy imports to meet 
domestic demand, the majority of which is sourced from 
oil. In Byblos, we rely significantly on polluting private 
generators to ensure the consistency of our energy 
supply. In a country with 300 days of sun each year, 
there is significant opportunity to create more local, 
clean and renewable energy supply networks, not least 
via photovoltaic and solar thermal technologies. We will 
explore options  to determine the optimal mix of energy 
sources to meet our demands. We will also ensure the 
use of incentives – such as tax credits, subsidies, and 
feed-in tariffs – and loans – like the low-interest NEEREA 
loans supported by the Central Bank of Lebanon – to 
promote the adoption of renewable energy generation, 
and consider interventions to improve energy efficiency 
and reduce demand, particularly through sustainable 
building design and operation. In addition, the efficient 
and renewable energy will contribute to our economic 
growth and to the creation of job opportunities for our

The Anti-littering animation developed by EcoConsulting 
in partnership with LMTA, and endorsed by the Ministry 
of Environment, will be shown in all schools as an extra-
curricular activity. The animation addresses irresponsible 
behavior toward waste, and the unfortunate consequences 
it leads to. It is supported by a question and answer sheet 
for teachers to engage their pupils in a discussion about 
littering and sustainable waste behaviors.

3. A PEACEFUL CITY: BYBLOS WILL BE 
A PEACEFUL CITY THAT EMBRACES 
AND PROMOTES SOCIAL COHESION 
AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY 

Byblos has a long history as an inclusive, multi-faith 
society populated by a diverse range of people and 
communities including native residents, migrant 
workers, and refugees. 

Peacefulness is a strong value for the city’s citizens; 
to date, Byblos has remained largely unaffected by 
unrest in other parts of the country. However, with 
rapid population growth, internal migration and an 
influx of refugees from Syria, maintenance of social 
cohesion is a growing challenge. 1.5 million Syrian 
refugees have recently sheltered in Lebanon; a 
country whose own population is just 4 million. The 
wider region is also threatened by armed conflicts 
resulting from injustice, oppression, lack of freedom, 
radical ideologies, violent autocratic governments 
and religious extremism. The initiatives identified 
under this goal are aimed at ensuring ongoing 
changes in the city do not jeopardize social cohesion 
or affect the peacefulness and tolerance that have 
characterized it for so long. 

Inclusivity is another key priority for Byblos. We 
are acutely conscious of the vulnerable groups that 
reside within the city, including those who are elderly, 
physically or mentally challenged, and socially or 
economically disadvantaged. This goal seeks to 
ensure these groups have a voice and their needs 
are adequately addressed. It further promotes the 
integration of vulnerable groups in all aspects of 
the city’s social, cultural and economic life. These 
principles are closely aligned with Goal 5, since by 
embracing the diversity of our people we can turn our 
unique city characteristics into a catalyst for diverse 
economic development.

Inclusivity and peacefulness also mean improving 
communication and engagement between citizens 
and local authorities, particularly outside of 
election times.. Actions under this goal are aimed at 
improving ongoing relations with our citizens and 
caza  communities to minimize the risk of instability, 
especially during volatile or strained periods. This will 
lead to improved governance for the city through 
actively engaged and empowered community.

INSPIRATION FROM PORTO 
ALEGRE  
Participatory budgeting as catalyst for 
collaboration

The 100RC process provided a platform for networking
between Porto Alegre, Medellin and New Orleans which has
helped the cities exchange experiences, collaborate to build
resilience, and identify common initiatives and actions that
respond to similar challenges. For instance, New Orleans’ 
‘Icons of Peace’ has inspired Porto Alegre to launch a similar 
initiative. Porto Alegre also recently signed a Memorandum 
of Understanding with Medellin to promote and share 
peacebuilding best practices. Along the way, Porto Alegre 
shared its extensive experience with participatory budgeting 
with these cities and discovered ways to increase effectiveness 
of this process through improved information sharing.

strengthen them and expand them to include 
the rest of the caza communities. Establishing 
these social networks will become the catalyst 
for economic, cultural and political collaboration.

PRIORITY ACTION: 1. ESTABLISH A 
COMMUNITY CENTER, PARTICULARLY TO 
SERVE VULNERABLE GROUPS (INCLUDING 
REFUGEES) IN BYBLOS

Description: The Municipality has conducted a survey 
in 2014 asking the citizens to prioritize projects and 
services that the city should take forward to address 
the community’s needs. Services for vulnerable 
groups, elderly people, and children were among 
the top priorities. Establishing a community center 
to contribute to our community’s development and 
cohesion is one of our priorities. The center will 
become the social hub for the city, and will offer 
appropriate services for the elderly, children and 
vulnerable groups, host the Youth Taskforce and 
neighborhood committee meetings, and become the 
venue for a variety of community and public events.
Action objective: To address the citizens’ needs, 
improve the quality of life and contribute to the 
community’s development and level of participation.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREONGOING ACTION: 2. PROMOTE CONFLICT 
RESOLUTION WORKSHOPS AND PROGRAMS

Description: Lebanese American University in 
Byblos, in collaboration with the Institute for Peace 
and Justice Education and the United Nations (UN), 
organized a two week conflict resolution workshop 
in summer 2014. Topics covered included an 
introduction to conflict, the root causes and triggers of 
violent conflict, causes of the Lebanese civil war, the 
political economy of civil wars, the UN and conflict 
resolution in the Middle East, prevention of violent 
conflict, power sharing and constitutional reform in 
Lebanon, and bottom up conflict resolution. Similar 

courses are delivered on a regular basis by the LAU, 
including Fundamentals of Conflict Resolution, Cross-
cultural Communication and Conflict, Community 
Conflict and Conflict Resolution. The cultural center of 
Byblos, in coordination with the Youth Taskforce, will 
coordinate the delivery of similar courses to selected 
young people, who in turn will deliver training to 
other community groups in the city. 

Action owner: Byblos Cultural Center, under the 
support and direction of the Municipality, can 
coordinate these activities between LAU, volunteers 
and the community.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURE4. A CULTURAL CITY: BYBLOS WILL 
PROTECT AND HONOR CULTURAL 
ASSETS, TRADITION, AND LOCAL 
IDENTITY

“Monuments left standing in situ include a 
small Neolithic village; a small Chalcolithic 
village; a 3rd millennium BC city wall, buildings 
and temples; a 2nd millennium royal necropolis 
and temple; a Persian period citadel; a Roman 
road, theater and nympheum; a Crusader 
castle and church; and an Ottoman mosque 
and buildings. The site is also famous for the 
treasures found in one of its temples and in its 
necropolis, which expose the craftsmanship, 
trade and cultural relations of the city in 
antiquity, mainly with Egypt.” 

Charbel Nahas, 2002, study of the development of the Old City of 
Jbail (Byblos) in the framework of the "Cultural Heritage Development" 
project, with the CDR and the World Bank.

Our cultural heritage, customs, and traditions are 
a source of pride for our people, contributing to 
the distinctiveness of our city. They need to be 
revived and celebrated.  Byblos’ history can be 
traced back to the development of the modern day 
alphabet, where myths of the death and birth of 
Adonis, Byblos’ main God made the city a famous 
pilgrimage site in the past.

Cities like Byblos can use protection and celebration 
of culture as a catalyst for improved economic 
development, community engagement, participation 
and social cohesion. This goal therefore contributes 
significantly to Goals 3 and 5. Some of our oldest 
traditional sectors have suffered from negligence, 
shifting economies, regional instability, and youth 
migration to larger cities. We believe that the 
traditional economies are an asset to our city that 
need to be incorporated in our strategy for a resilient 
Byblos. These include crafts, agriculture, fishing and 
others.

Furthermore, this goal is closely related to Goal 1, 
since without sensitive, responsible and integrated 
urban development strategies we risk losing 
our unique built heritage to uncontrolled urban 
development.

BYBLOS WORKING WITH OUR 
PARTNERS 
A tsunami simulation for our city

Our heritage sites are vulnerable to environmental change 
and shock events. The high waves created by storm ‘Zina’ in 
January 2015 damaged our Old Port. A tsunami simulation 
conducted by our 100RC Platform Partner Swiss Re confirms 
that our Old Port is at risk from coastal flooding. Based on 
two different tsunami scenarios generated from earthquakes 
in the region, it is predicted that the largest tsunami could 
create a 6 meter wave in the port area. This type of event 
has a return period of around 2,000 years, while a smaller 
tsunami of 1-3 meters may re-occur every 300-1,000 years. 
Due to the elevated coastline around Byblos, many of our 
assets on higher ground would be protected, but the port 
area would be inundated and some of our old religious 
buildings too.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURE

WE WILL:

•  Protect the City’s historic assets and coastal heritage
•  Establish local markets to cherish and protect local identity and traditional 

businesses

GOAL A: PROTECT THE CITY'S 
HISTORIC ASSETS AND COASTAL 
HERITAGE

Goal objective: To develop measures, guidelines 
and frameworks for the protection of the city’s 
historic assets.

ACTION: 1. UNDERTAKE A FEASIBILITY 
STUDY TO IDENTIFY COASTAL MANAGEMENT 
SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT THE CITY AND 
IMPROVE THE MARINE BIODIVERSITY

Description: We will investigate appropriate planning 
measures, including hard and soft engineering 
techniques to address the adverse effects of 
tsunamis, sea level rise, and flooding. The current 
pier is affecting the sea current and directing the 
force of the waves onto the ancient port. It has 
already damaged the marine habitat and created a 
moderately adverse visual impact. This has resulted in 
partial collapse of the ancient tower at the entrance 
to the port. We want to explore the options to 
construct a wave breaker to absorb the impacts of 
strong waves, reduce damage to the Old port, and 
protect fishermen’s livelihoods. We would like to 
align this project with efforts to restore the marine 
biodiversity. We will work with technical specialists to 
identify the most effective combination of hard and 
soft solutions to achieve these outcomes.  

Action objective: To ensure the protection of the 
coastal historic assets such as the old port and the 
Phoenician port. 

Action owner: Byblos Municipality, Ministry of 
Environment, Ministry of culture, Ministry of Public 
Works and Transport. 

ACTION: 2. DEVELOP RESTORATION 
GUIDELINES AND TECHNIQUES FOR THE 
PRESERVATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF 
BYBLOS’ OLD CITY

Description: Establish a framework in partnership 
with the local community, heritage experts in the 
city and national government institutions, for the 
restoration of historic buildings in the city, similar 
to the restoration of the souk façades which was 
completed in 2014. Develop affordable restoration 
techniques for property owners to implement, and 
give incentives for training and implementation, such 
as loans and tax deductions.

BYBLOS PREPARING TO 
RESPOND
In 2014, within the scope of the National 
Response Plan, UNDP collaborated with 
Lebanon’s National Committee of Disaster 
Management and the Response Committee 
of the Caza of Byblos to undertake a field 
simulation scenario of earthquake and tsunami 
disaster management in the city of Byblos. 
Local schools, hospitals, the Civil Defense, and 
the Army participated in this exercise, which 
included evacuation of students from a school, 
receiving patients in the nearest hospital, rescue 
of injured citizens, warning citizens before a 
tsunami, ushering citizens to safe areas, securing 
roads for logistical supports, and preparing 
a municipal crisis management room. The 
simulation aimed at testing the response plan 
and practicing communication and cooperation 
among the different stakeholders, and at 
identifying areas of strengths of weaknesses in 
the city’s capability at responding.

35 

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREGOAL B: PROTECT AND 
PROMOTE LOCAL IDENTITY AND 
TRADITIONAL BUSINESSES

Goal objective: To use culture, heritage and 
traditions in Byblos as a catalyst for economic 
and social development. To support our 
community in reviving Byblos’ social and 
economic heritage and dormant traditions.

 

PRIORITY ACTION: 1. ORGANIZE A LOCAL 
FARMERS' MARKET IN BYBLOS TO MARKET 
LOCAL PRODUCE 

Description: We want to organize a monthly farmers' 
market in the Old City to promote the small-scale 
farmers, fishermen and traditional industries. The 
market will become a social space where communities 
from across the caza meet and interact. We will 
engage with organizations with previous experience, 
such as Souk El Tayeb, to seek support and potential 
partnership.

Action objective: To market the local produce of 
the city and surrounding villages and promote local 
products. To revive traditional foods and recipes to 
protect and celebrate local identity.

Action owner: Community-based organizations, with 
the Office of Community Development, supported by 
Byblos Municipality
Action partners: Byblos Municipality, Souk El Tayeb, 
farmers, and fishermen cooperatives

Timeline: Medium term

Resilience value: 

•  Preservation of traditional economic activities
•  Reinforcement of social cohesion and 

relationships

•  Valorization of the local products 
•  Revival of local industries and economies

ACTION: 2. EMPOWER LOCAL COMMUNITY, 
PARTICULARLY WOMEN, TO REVIVE 
TRADITIONAL CRAFTS AND DEVELOP 
MARKETS FOR ARTISANAL PRODUCTS

Description: We want to revive and support 
our traditional crafts through collaboration and 
partnerships with private organizations to empower 
craftsmen and women, offer required skills training, 
improve quality of products, and explore innovative 
designs and improved technology. We want to give 
incentives to artisans to market and sell the products 
through valorization and promotion of a high quality 
brand for Byblos’ traditional crafts.

Action owner: Byblos Municipality, Union of 
Municipalities

Action partners: Private sector sponsors, schools, 
universities, local NGOs and social enterprises. 

BYBLOS WORKING 
COLLABORATIVELY
During the 100RC strategy development process, 
the city has collaborated with the Lebanese 
American University (LAU) under the supervision 
of Professor Jose Madrigal, to begin surveying 
and creating an inventory of the historical assets 
in the city. We need to continue our efforts in 
surveying and documenting all our historical 
assets including assets requiring restoration 
and preservation. The inventory should include 
the type, condition, age, and ownership of 
our historic assets, which will enable us to 
monitor and protect our heritage resources. The 
inventory should be accompanied with survey 
and mapping information compatible with GIS.

As we take this work forwards, the municipal 
Engineering department will become the owner 
of the inventory. They will collaborate with our 
Platform Partner ESRI, with continued input 
from LAU together with the Lebanese Ministries 
of Culture and Environment, and UNESCO.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREINSPIRATION FROM NORFOLK  
Norfolk, Virginia

This US coastal city with a bustling port is embarking on 
a resilience building journey with notable similarities to 
Byblos. Released in October 2015, their resilience strategy 
helps the city address its challenges in an integrated 
manner. Like Byblos, it is grappling with growing coastal 
threats, which threaten to undermine both prosperity and 
community cohesion. Addressing these threats will require 
better understanding and dissemination of the city’s data, 
connecting and empowering marginalized communities, and 
the identification and implementation of innovative water 
management solutions. Examples of these approaches 
include: 

•  Launching a state of the art resilience dashboard to 

integrate and synthesize data; 

•  Partnerships with the Netherlands to design robust 

water management initiatives; 

•  Empowering neighborhood faith-based communities to 

support emergency preparedness efforts across the city.    

SHOWCASING BEST PRACTICE  
L’Artisan du Liban is a social enterprise founded in Beirut 
in 1979, an initiative of the Lebanese Social Movement with 
support from private donors. Its mission is to preserve 
Lebanese crafts and artisanal creative products, and allow 
artisans to maintain a viable livelihood through their work. 
The key drivers for the initiative are to promote the creativity 
of young artisans, coordinate the marketing of products 
through outlets in Lebanon and promote distribution abroad, 
contribute to job creation in rural and urban areas, empower 
workers, and distribute revenues to promote crafts and 
finance social projects. L’Artisan du Liban currently has three 
stores Beirut and Tripoli. Currently, more than 800 artisans, 
throughout Lebanon contribute to the creation of artisanal 
work. In 2014, a new workshop opened in Tekrit-Akkar, a 
remote rural area, creating an opportunity for both Syrian 
refugees and local people to acquire skills in traditional 
Syrian Aghabeneh embroidery, sewing and block printing, 
thereby contributing to social inclusion, identity and creating 
economic opportunities for Syrian women.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTURE5. A THRIVING CITY: BYBLOS WILL 
BE A CITY THAT DIVERSIFIES ITS 
ECONOMY FLOURISHES FROM OUR 
VALUED CULTURAL AND HUMAN 
RESOURCES

Promoting and maintaining the diversity of Byblos’ 
economy is a critical requirement to ensure resilience, 
especially by expanding the city’s role as a hub for 
banking, retail, education and artistic and cultural 
activities, as well as an advanced medical center 
for the region north of Beirut and north Lebanon. 
By creating economic opportunities and enabling 
sustainable livelihoods, the city can support its 
population into the future and generate the financial 
resources needed to secure its survival.

Diversification is an integral outcome from each of our 
other resilience goals; by transforming our approach 
to urban development, environmental management, 
social cohesion and cultural heritage, we intend to 
generate new economic opportunities that build upon 
our historic assets to create a forward-looking future 
city.

Byblos is characterized by a vibrant and diverse 
economy, which places the city in a strong economic 
position compared with other Lebanese cities. 
Historically, the main economic activities of the city 
centerd around trade and agriculture. Today, with 
the help of migration and tourism, the city hosts 
12 main industries, spanning health, education, 
finance, hospitality, tourism, commerce, law, and 
construction, among others. There are around 3,000 
businesses in Byblos serving a growing number of 
city residents and visitors. 

Our dependence on agriculture has declined 
substantially as other activities have grown and 
real estate development has expanded on to our 
former farm lands. Around 150,000m2 of agricultural 
land remains in Byblos, consisting primarily of 
greenhouses. 

Byblos continues to hold a strong appeal with 
tourists, especially Lebanese and other Arab visitors; 
the city has been named Arabic Capital of Tourism 
2016 by The Arab Tourism Organization. However, 
continued instability in the region has led to a decline 
in the number of foreign tourists. Overreliance on 
tourism revenue is therefore a significant resilience 
challenge.  

38

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREWE WILL:

•  Promote innovative economic enterprises which create future opportunities 

that build from Byblos’ existing strengths

•  Strengthen the city’s role in regional economic development
Improve the socio-economic conditions of Byblos residents
• 

ONGOING ACTION: 2. DELIVER A PROGRAM 
OF EVENTS AND FESTIVALS ALL YEAR LONG 
TO PROMOTE LOCAL CULTURE, TRADITIONAL 
FOOD AND MUSIC

Description: Byblos is renowned for its annual 
International Festival, which attracts performers 
and artists from all over Lebanon and the world 
for a month-long festival of arts and music. In 
summer 2015, Byblos also launched a new festival 
to celebrate local wines, drawing on its history of 
exporting Lebanese wines to the Roman Empire. This 
ongoing festival program is important to promoting 
Byblos as a destination and attracting visitors who 
spend money in local shops, restaurants and hotels. 
The festivals will continue to play a central part in 
Byblos’ economy, and opportunities to expand and 
diversify the program of events will be considered 
on an ongoing basis to attract a wider audience, 
especially during the tourist low season. We will 
particularly focus on supporting lesser-known, 
younger artists to help build their profile, and we 
will develop a stronger communications plan to 
support our events. In 2016, an exhibition may be 
held to celebrate Byblos’ year as Arabic Capital of 
Tourism. We would also like to enhance the content 
of our existing festivals by introducing themes about 
environmental responsibility and green practices – 
for example, raising awareness through the use of 
recycling stations, recyclable packaging, e-ticketing, 
etc. – which will help to achieve our goal of resource 
efficiency. 

Action owner: Byblos Municipality.

Action partners: Ministry of Tourism, Union of 
Municipalities, event managers.

GOAL A: PROMOTE INNOVATIVE 
ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES, WHICH 
CREATE FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES 
THAT BUILD FROM BYBLOS’ 
EXISTING STRENGTHS

Goal objective: To promote diversification into 
sectors that will enable Byblos to be more active 
in the 21st century global economy, particularly 
sectors that attract young people.

ASPIRATIONAL ACTION: 1. SUPPORT AND 
ENCOURAGE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED 
ENTERPRISES (SMES) IN EXISTING AND 
POTENTIAL INDUSTRY SECTORS

Description: Byblos has a long legacy of economic 
activity and skills related to traditional crafts, 
agriculture/horticulture and fishing, not to mention 
a unique built heritage that offers a special setting 
for media, film production, and digital. We would like 
to promote growth clusters that encourage these 
creative industries to develop and thrive in Byblos, 
making use of existing networks and partnerships. 
By developing growth clusters, we will incentivize 
SMEs to locate in Byblos by offering them space 
and communication/logistical facilities. We will 
build a local knowledge base to promote research 
and innovation around our targeted industries. 
This will draw young creative entrepreneurs from 
local universities to settle in Byblos. We will create 
incubators for new creative products and activities. 
In the long term, the market for these sectors will 
grow as Byblos becomes recognized as a hub for 
the creative economy, a reputation that will further 
enhance our attractiveness to tourists and other 
visitors. 

Through our growth clusters we do not intend to 
constrain ourselves only to creative industries. Our 
encouragement of clusters will also target healthcare, 
which is already strong in Byblos but which will need 
to continue developing as we respond to a growing 
population and seek to retain our position as a 
healthy city in Lebanon.

39 

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREGOAL B: STRENGTHEN THE CITY’S 
ROLE IN REGIONAL ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT

Goal objective: To grow our local economy as 
an integral part of economic development in the 
wider region, leading to improved capacity to 
thrive sustainably as a union of municipalities 
and not only as one small city.

PRIORITY ACTION: 1. IDENTIFY AND 
INTEGRATE THE ASSETS OF THE REGIONAL 
HINTERLAND OF BYBLOS TO FOSTER 
PARTNERSHIPS AND DIVERSIFY TOURISM

Description: Byblos’ economic influence is not 
constrained to the municipal borders. The larger 
district (qadaa) of Jbeil comprises 92 towns and 
villages and around 83,000 inhabitants over an 
area of 430 square kilometers. While Byblos is the 
capital of the district and hosts a range of important 
archaeological and coastal visitor attractions, the 
wider district also has a wealth of facilities and 
attractions to offer. One of the challenging things 
about tourism in Byblos is the short average duration 
of each tourist visit. By leveraging the assets of the 
wider region, Byblos has the opportunity to create a 
program of tourist activities that would attract longer 
stays and a more diverse range of tourist experiences, 
thereby enhancing Byblos’ reputation as a tourist 
center. This would reap benefits both for Byblos 
itself, and for the surrounding towns and villages. For 
example, organized trips could be offered to tourists 
staying in Byblos’ luxury hotels, to visit beautifully 
preserved local villages in the mountains, to hike, take 
environmental excursions, sample cuisine cooked 
from ingredients grown on local farms, participate in 
cooking and craft schools, and visit local wineries. In 
collaboration with local hotels and businesses in the 
wider region, we will identify opportunities to expand 
Byblos’ tourist program and attract new types of 
ecotourism, cultural tourism, artistic and gastronomic 
tourism. This diversification will attract people 
from a wider variety of ages and backgrounds and 
help to strengthen and sustain our tourism sector. 
Opportunities could be promoted to tourists via 
hotels and a strengthened tourist office in Byblos.

Action objective: To diversify the range of tourist 
attractions available to Byblos’ visitors, promoting 
longer stays and deeper engagement with the culture 
and environment of the region. 

Action owner: Byblos Municipality.

Action partners: Ministry of Tourism, travel agencies 
and tour operators, regional businesses including 
hotels, museums, wineries, restaurants, etc.

Timeline: Medium term.

Resilience value: 

•  Strengthened and more sustainable tourist sector 

for Byblos.

•  Creation of new jobs in the tourist sector, 

supporting the growing city population.

•  Generation of additional revenues through 

expansion of tourist sector.

•  Enhanced image and reputation for the city and 

district.
Improved flow of tourist revenues to towns and 
villages in the wider area.
Improved coordination of economic planning and 
governance between the city and wider region.
Incentives to preserve heritage and traditional 
practices in the wider region as a mechanism to 
attract tourists.

ACTION: 2. PARTNER AND COLLABORATE 
WITH THE UNION OF MUNICIPALITIES 
TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SHARED OR 
COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

Description: We will schedule regular meetings 
with other municipalities, business and economic 
stakeholders to explore and identify potential 
development projects or targeted investments that 
could benefit multiple cities and villages, including 
Byblos, by building on our common resources. 
Partnerships with other municipalities and business 
beyond Byblos’ city limits will be an important way 
to create new economic opportunities within Byblos 
itself. By drawing on the combined resources of 
the Union of Municipalities we can each achieve 
more value with less individual cost. Examples of 
collaborative initiatives might be a shared program 
of cultural events and festivals at a specific time in 
the year, a shared tourist guide to promote visitor 
attractions throughout the region, networking 
and training events for entrepreneurs and SMEs 
throughout the region to help consolidate our growth 
clusters, or physical developments such as a training 
center for use by all municipalities in the Union.

business stakeholders.

RESILIENT BYBLOS – CONNECTING WITH OUR PAST, CREATING OUR FUTUREACTION: 3. EXPAND OFFERS IN EXISTING 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLABORATE TO 
CREATE NEW PROGRAMS FOR EMERGING 
SECTORS

Description: Byblos is home to the Lebanese 
American University (LAU) campus outside Beirut. 
This is an incredible asset for Byblos compared with 
other cities in the country. Furthermore, as a world 
heritage center designated by the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), Byblos is an international focus for 
research and education related to the city’s ancient 
history. These assets are the foundation for Byblos to 
grow its knowledge economy to become a regional 
hub for learning and education, especially in relation 
to history, archaeology and urbanism. Through the 
development of this strategy we have already worked 
closely with architects in the urban planning unit at 
LAU, as well as leveraging projects that are being run 
by other stakeholders via the university (such as the 
bus stop design competition for the Municipality). We 
will look for opportunities to continue consolidating 
links between the Municipality and our university, and 
to identify research and educational projects within 
the city that could attract other researchers and 
educators from inside and outside Lebanon. By doing 
so we hope to further diversify Byblos’ economy and 
raise the city’s status internationally as a center for 
research and knowledge.

Action owner: Byblos Municipality.

Action partners: Lebanese American University, 
UNESCO, other educational partners

GOAL C: IMPROVE THE SOCIO-
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF 
BYBLOS’ RESIDENTS

Goal objective: To improve the quality of life for 
Byblos residents, particularly those working in 
traditional industries, by promoting viable and 
sustainable livelihoods

PRIORITY ACTION: 1. IMPROVE THE 
SUSTAINABILITY OF FISHERMEN’S 
LIVELIHOODS

Description: Fishing is a long-standing part of 
Byblos’ economy and society. However over 
recent years, fishing has become a less lucrative 
profession, the number of fishermen has decreased 
and the special traditions of local fishing have 
been declining. We would like to reinvigorate our 
traditional fishing industry by offering support to 
fishermen via the fishermen syndicate union. We will 
explore opportunities to offer training on sustainable 
fishing and basic business skills to enable fishermen 
to manage their activities effectively. We will also 
explore options to diversify the fishing industry by 
introducing a fishing school and day trips for visitors 
to learn the traditional fishing techniques. This could 
be linked with local cooking schools to enable visitors 
to learn both how to catch and prepare their fish 
according to local customs. These opportunities will 
be promoted via local hotels and the tourist center. 
We hope this would bring an alternative source of 
income for fishermen, helping to create a more viable 
livelihood. Furthermore, we will explore options to 
re-open the fish market in Byblos to provide better 
opportunities for fishermen to sell their products. 

SHOWCASING BEST PRACTICE  
Beit Douma is a guest house located in the village of Douma 
in the Batroun Mountains near Byblos. The guest house is a 
carefully restored 19th-century Lebanese mountain home, 
and the village of Douma is recognized as one of the best-
preserved villages in Lebanon. Surrounded by olive groves 
and orchards, Beit Douma positions itself a retreat for 
visitors seeking to get away from the stress of everyday life, 
enjoying traditional foods with produce from the kitchen 
garden.

Beit Douma is one of three such guest houses developed by 
the Souk El Tayeb organization. Byblos has the opportunity 
to create its own role within an agenda of sustainable 
economic development in the surrounding region.

ACTION: 2. ESTABLISH INCENTIVES TO 
ENCOURAGE FARMERS TO CONTINUE 
CULTIVATING THEIR AGRICULTURAL LAND 
WITHIN BYBLOS

• 

Description: East of the highway, the modern city of 
Byblos is an increasingly dense urban environment, 
however there remain several pockets of agricultural 

and horticultural land that have withstood modern 
urban growth. On this land, farmers continue to 
cultivate bananas, pomegranates, olives and other 
fruits. This local produce is part of the region’s history, 
and we would like to prolong our connection to the 
land despite the ongoing threat of development. We 
will seek to help farmers diversify their businesses 
and improve productivity, for example with the use 
of improved farming practices and technologies, and 
developing brands based on local and sustainable/
organic produce. We will explore options to 
incentivize farmers to continue cultivating their 
land, for example by finding opportunities to sell 
produce locally at farmers’ markets and local stores 
in the city. Our work with farmers will connect to our 
wider strategy to protect Byblos’ natural and cultural 
heritage, and promote new forms of tourism centered 
around the region’s traditional practices.

EVOLVING PRACTICE  
The municipality of Jounieh, just south 
of Byblos, received around $250,000 
from the United States’ Agency for 
International Development (USAID) 
under the Building Alliance for Local 
Advancement, Development and 
Investment (BALADI), to improve the 
cooperative facilities for fishermen 
at Jounieh port. It aims to reactivate 
the harbor of Jounieh as part of the 
broader development strategy for 
the city. Upgrades to the port include 
rehabilitation of the fishermen’s boat 
repair workshop, renovation of the 
fishermen’s cooking station, as well 
as the fish auction site. The upgrades 
benefit around 40 fishermen and 
their families by improving working 
conditions and reducing the financial 
burden of managing fishing activities, 
leading to more viable livelihoods.

LEARNING FROM OUR PAST
During a visit to Byblos, one cannot help but notice the 
granite columns inserted in the walls of the Old city, the 
citadel and the crusaders’ castle. The granite columns 
were quarried in Egypt and brought to Byblos by the 
Romans to use in the construction of the city to reinforce 
and fortify the walls, particularly against the threat of 
earthquake. Our city’s existence to this day is evidence 
that the ancient civilizations who inhabited the city were 
thinking of innovative solutions to shocks early on.

RESILIENCE DIAGNOSTIC

BYBLOS IN CONTEXT

Byblos is known to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the 
world; a Phoenician city, inhabited since Neolithic times with evidence of human 
settlements dating back more than 7,000 years. As such, the city is already a 
testament to resilience. We want to embrace our challenges, and build resilience 
to maintain the city’s existence for the next 7,000 years.  

Ancient Byblos was a major port, trade hub and center of learning; the founding 
of the modern alphabet by the Phoenicians earned the city its name - Byblos – 
which comes from the Greek for papyrus. 

Modern Byblos – or Jbeil – retains a strong sense of its heritage; home to the 
internationally distinguished Lebanese American University (LAU) and renowned 
for its diversity of cultural and religious traditions. The city has been recognized 
as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1984. 

Despite a long and destructive civil war in Lebanon (1975-1991), the city of Byblos 
has remained largely unaffected by unrest in other parts of the country. Then as 
now, the city is proud of its long tradition of multi-faith tolerance and ethnic co-
existence. In the wake of current conflicts in nearby Syria and Iraq, efforts are 
now underway to ensure that the pressures placed upon the city’s services by 
an influx of refugees and migrants do not negatively affect the peacefulness and 
tolerance that have characterized the city for so long, but become an opportunity 
for the city in the future. Challenging events such as these should not damage the 
city’s image as open, tolerant and diverse. Among others, these factors provide a 
contextual underpinning to the development of the resilience strategy.

OVERVIEW OF OUR EXISTING RESILIENCE ACTIONS

We have already successfully implemented many initiatives to develop our city’s resilience, taking advantage 
of opportunities and partnerships on the national and international levels. We will build on these positive 
beginnings as we take forward our strategy for resilience through to 2030. 

•  Completion of a preliminary transport capacity study with the city of Carcassone, France, to begin 

planning an effective transit system for Byblos; 

•  Participation in the UNISDR Making Cities Resilient campaign, along with four other Lebanese cities, 

focused on preparing for and responding to emergency; 

ߚ

•  Participation in the MED-3R solid waste management project to identify suitable urban waste strategies;
•  Creation of a multifunctional public park for the dual benefits of recreation and environmental 

management. This project won a prize in Barcelona for its landscape design (1) ;

•  Restoration of the souk façades in the Old City, financed by Byblos Bank (2);
•  Development of a Cultural Center for Byblos, together with the Ministry of Culture (3);
•  Construction of a new municipal building, creating an iconic community center bridging the Old City and 

• 

the newer part of the city east of the main highway (4);
Installation of parking meters, electric shuttles and pedestrian footpaths in the Old City to reduce traffic 
congestion (5);

•  Construction of a sports complex for community use, funded by the association of Carlos Slim and 

suitable for local recreation as well as international sports events (6).

•  Participation in "War Free World Heritage Listed Cities", focused on defining risk preparedness plans 
and risk mitigation measures for the cities of Byblos in Lebanon and Mtskheta in Georgia. It aimed at 
developing a strategy to create the required conditions for both Byblos and Mtskheta to be candidates for 
enhanced protection status to UNESCO.

DELIVERY AND MONITORING

DELIVERING THE STRATEGY

Our Regional & National Government

We recognize that this strategy is ambitious. But we 
believe we can unlock the necessary resources to 
make these actions a reality. This will be achieved 
through local, national, and international partnerships. 
And this strategy will serve as the foundation for 
attracting these partners while providing a coherent 
and thoughtful road map for exploration and 
innovation. 

In the coming months we will create a detailed action 
plan, assign roles and responsibilities and appropriate 
timelines for the execution of these tasks. Successful 
implementation will require strong coordination and 
communication with a diverse array of individuals. 

Our People

People are our most important asset and we want to 
ensure all of our skills and knowledge are put to the 
most effective use in implementing the strategy. 

Our Platform Partners

The Platform is a curated suite of resilience-building 
tools and services, provided by partners from the 
private, public, academic, and non-profit sectors, 
giving our cities access to the resources they need to 
become more resilient. 

Our Stakeholders

The CRO’s office will be responsible for initiating 
the plan, in collaboration with the Working Groups 
and other local stakeholders including NGOs 
and academic partners. The strategy provides a 
framework for the delivery of the resilience goals and 
actions we’ve identified but collaboration is essential 
to make sure everyone is supported and able to carry 
out the actions we’ve set ourselves. 

Our Municipal Staff

Over the coming months, we’ll be working with 
municipal staff to ensure they have the tools they 
need to deliver the strategy, and the support to 
engage with a variety of other city actors. 

Beyond the limits of the city, we believe the strategy 
also provides a meaningful platform to engage 
regional authorities and partners including the union 
of municipalities, and the national government. As 
a pioneer in resilience, we hope to use what we’ve 
learned over recent months to facilitate a wider dialog 
on the importance and potential impact of resilience 
planning in the region and the country. Through this 
process we also aim to engage new collaborators and 
establish working partnerships for the mutual benefit 
of all involved.

MONITORING PROGRESS

Dialog and transparency are important to the delivery 
of the resilience plan. To ensure we’re progressing 
toward our targets and building on our actions, we 
are setting out a monitoring plan. 

City Perceptions Tool

Having developed an action plan to enhance 
resilience, it is also important that we keep track 
of how activities are progressing so we can make 
adjustments, assess impacts and explore further 
opportunities. 

During the PRA process, we carried out a Stakeholder 
Perception analysis using a structured perception tool. 
This helped us to understand how city stakeholders 
view the current level of resilience in Byblos, as well 
as the major risks facing the city and opportunities 
to tackle them using our existing assets. As part of 
the ongoing monitoring process, we will run this 
tool again to gauge how views have changed since 
it was implemented, and how drivers have evolved 
since the start of the resilient strategy development. 
This will allow us to assess progress, and identify any 
remaining gaps and future risks that the strategy may 
then be adapted to cover.

Monitoring will allow the CRO and other stakeholders 
working on resilience to review the status of actions 
and facilitate feedback between parties, for example 
relating to challenges that prevent progress. The 
monitoring schedule will also provide a framework 
through which we will keep the Mayor up-to-date 
on the development of the action plan. The Working 
Groups and other partners including LAU will also 
feed into this process.
