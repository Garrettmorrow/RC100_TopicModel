FLUCTUAT NEC MERGITUR

Front page : Bernard Pedretti/ Mairie de Paris

Anne Hidalgo, 
Mayor of Paris

“Fluctuat nec Mergitur”, which translates to “Beaten 
by the waves but not sunk”, proudly announces our 
motto. Made official in 1853 by the Baron Haussmann, 
it had been used by Parisians since the 16th century. 
Its  origins  lie  in  the  river’s  history,  dating  back  to 
antiquity!  Urban  resilience  is  therefore  not  a  new 
trend: it is an integral part of urban discourse. The 
concept  was,  however,  somewhat  forgotten  at 
the  end  of  the  20th  century,  as  our  societies  were 
convinced that technical solutions would be able to 
overcome the risks faced by our cities.

Today  we  are  confronted  with  new  and  great 
challenges,  which  affect  current  and 
future 
generations. Climate change, air pollution, growing 
inequalities, 
threats,  persistent  water 
insecurity,  the  migrant  crisis  –  all  these  challenges 
bring cities to the front line.  

terror 

Far  from  inducing  anxiety,  urban  resilience  offers 
solutions  to  better  prepare  and  adapt  cities,  their 
populations, businesses and infrastructures to these 
challenges. It also provides opportunities to create 
new  activities  and  jobs  while  improving  citizens’ 
quality of life.

Governance, which is our ability to organise ourselves 
collectively with all stakeholders and to create new 
partnerships, particularly beyond the municipality, is 
key to the resilience of Paris.

It is also the functioning of our city that is in question: 
its  flexibility,  its  ability  to  learn  from  disasters  to 
better  anticipate  them,  to  think  of  its  projects  in 
a  systemic  way  that  multiplies  their  benefits,  but 
also  to  mobilise  and  include  citizens,  companies, 
researchers in those projects. This resilience strategy 
is  therefore  aimed  at  citizens,  since  it  is  primarily 
Parisians  who  will  build  the  resilience  of  Paris.  We 
will  offer  them  opportunities  to  be  further  trained, 
mobilised,  engaged  and  united, 
in  emergency 
situations  and  in  everyday  life.  It  is  also  necessary 
that our infrastructure and the way we think about 
urban  planning  be  more  adapted  to  their  needs 
and  current  challenges.  It  is  therefore  a  matter  of 
transforming  Paris,  in  order  to  calmly  confront  the 
risks of the century and improve Parisians’ quality of 
life in both the short and long terms.

I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the 
institutional,  business,  academic  and  associated 
partners, as well as to the municipal teams, for their 
contribution  to  this  very  ambitious  work,  which 
has  only  just  begun.  I  also  warmly  thank  Michael 
Berkowitz  and  100  Resilient  Cities  –  Pioneered  by 
the  Rockefeller  Foundation  (100RC),  who  have 
enlightened,  guided  and  supported  us  in  this 
essential step for our city and Parisians.”

Deputy Mayor for the 
Environment 

“In recent years, our city has been confronted with 
some  significant  challenges.  Paris  has  experienced 
record  flooding  of  the  Seine,  intense  heat  waves  – 
including that of 2003 which led to a sanitary disaster 
–  terror  attacks,  and  a  large  influx  of  migrants.  In 
response to the scale of these challenges, structural, 
systemic and cultural changes are required, and the 
city and its citizens must be prepared to cope with 
and bounce back from such emergencies.

In  2015,  just  a  few  weeks  before  COP21,  the  City 
of  Paris  launched  an  Adaptation  Strategy  that  laid 
the  foundation  for  a  more  resilient  territory.  The 
Strategy  sets  out  a  vision  to  adapt  Paris  to  the 
effects  of  climate  change  and  resource  scarcity 
while  making  it  more  attractive  and  more  pleasant 
to live in. The resilience strategy builds on this vision 
and  further  anticipates  the  changes  in  our  society 
and  places  a  greater  emphasis  on  social  cohesion. 
The concept of resilience carries within it the notion 
of cross-cutting, interdependencies and co-benefits. 
It  allows  us  to  frame  the  major  challenges  facing 
our  territories  as  a  coherent  whole  and  to  deliver 
projects that reinforce one another.

Humans are at the centre of this strategy. Citizens, 
commuters, partners are at the heart of our attention. 
It  is  the  strength  of  social  bonds,  and  everyone’s 
active  participation  in  a  common  destiny  that  will 
enable  us  to  become  a  resilient,  livable  and  proud 
city in the face of various risks. Paris is very pleased 
to  benefit  from  the  support  of  the  Rockefeller 
Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities programme, which 
enables us to accelerate and considerably improve 
the municipality’s actions aimed at working together 
to build a more resilient city.”

Paris Resilience StrategyMichael Berkowitz, 
President, 100 Resilient Cities

“On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) family, 
I  want  to  congratulate  Mayor  Anne  Hidalgo,  the  city  of 
Paris, and Chief Resilience Officer Sebastien Maire, on the 
release of Paris Resilience Strategy, a major milestone for 
the city and 100RC’s partnership with it.

The cultural, political, and economic center of France for 
close to a millennium, Paris still remains one of the most 
vibrant  and  important  cities  in  Europe  and  the  world. 
The  city’s  motto  Fluctuat  Nec  Mergitur  --  Tossed  but 
Never Sunk – perfectly captures the city’s long history of 
resilience, as it has endured and survived invasions, sieges, 
plagues  and  violent  political  upheavals.    More  recently, 
Paris has secured its place at the vanguard of important 
political  and  cultural  forces,  hosting  COP  21  where  the 
historic  Paris  Climate  Agreement  was  reached.  Now, 
Paris stands poised to turn its challenges into resilience-
building  opportunities.  This  Strategy  provides  the  city  a 
framework for actions that ensure this is a future in which 
Paris  continues  to  not  only  survive  but  thrive,  and  lead 
other cities to do so as well.

With  the  Paris  Resilience  Strategy,  the  city  has  set  itself 
on a course to form meaningful urban resilience through 
plans that account for the city’s entire urban ecosystem.  
It  addresses  not  only  the  city’s  shocks,  such  as  terror 
attacks, extreme heat, flooding, and infrastructure failure, 
but  also  its  chronic  stresses,  such  as  poor  air  quality, 
economic  inequality,  and  social  exclusion  -  continuous 
pressures that erode the urban fabric and exacerbate the 
major  shocks  when  they  do  occur.  As  it  implements  the 
Strategy  and  its  integrated  inter-systemic  solutions,  it 
can serve as a model to cities across Europe and around 
the  world.  The  Strategy’s  six  themes  –  social,  economic, 
territorial inequalities and social cohesion; climate change; 
air  pollutions  and  environmental  health;  terrorism  and 
security;  the  Seine  River;  and  territorial  governance 
--  present  a  holistic  framework  with  interventions  that 
maximize the city’s assets and provide multiple benefits. 

As Paris implements its Strategy, it can serve as a model 
to other cities across Europe and around the world. The 
Strategy’s pillars aim to build an inclusive and supportive 
city to strengthen social cohesion, adapt infrastructure to 
meet the challenges of the 21st century, harness the city’s 
talent and dynamism and adapt its governance systems to 
better integrate with surrounding territories –  recognizing 
that many of the city’s most deeply entrenched stresses 
require a metropolitan lens. The interventions designed to 
realize these goals include using schools as cooling oases 
during heatwaves; creating a resilient and carbon-neutral 
neighborhood in Saint-Vincent de Paul; transforming the 
Paris ring road; and supporting climate change adaptation 
measures connected to the Seine to improve water quality 
and prevent flooding.  Within these lies Paris’ opportunity

to  become  a  world-class  exporter  of  best  practices  for 
tackling  climate-related  threats  while  achieving  social 
integration for its most poor and vulnerable citizens. This 
Strategy can serve as both a blueprint and an engine for 
all of Paris’ efforts to ensure a future that is more inclusive, 
healthy,  integrated,  economically  and  socially  equitable, 
and where the environment and climate change are forces 
to live with and not against.

Through the commitment and hard work of CRO Sebastien 
Maire and his team, and the unfailing support of Mayor Anne 
Hidalgo  and  Deputy  Mayor  Celia  Blauel,  this  ambitious 
Strategy reflects the diversity of voices and communities 
engaged during its development. It also reveals the active 
role  Paris  has  already  played  in  our  network,  not  least 
through  its  participation  in  the  100RC  city  exchange  on 
migration late last year and the current collaboration and 
work  on  metropolitan  governance  issues  with  Santiago, 
Greater Manchester and other member cities. 

Even  after  months  of  effort  and  tireless  leadership, 
100RC’s  partnership  with  Paris  is  just  beginning,  and  we 
are excited to see Paris continue on its path of innovative 
interventions to ensure a vibrant collective future. Because 
we know that only by implementing this groundbreaking 
Strategy  can  we  help  ensure  a  resilient  future  for  Paris, 
and all those who reside there.”

Sébastien Maire, 
Chief Resilience Officer

“This strategy is not a detailed and comprehensive 
“plan”  that  pretends  to  list  all  the  actions  to  be 
carried  out  in  the  decades  to  come  to  guarantee 
the resilience of Paris. Such an approach would be 
contrary  to  the  concept  of  resilience  given  that, 
within 30 years, scientific discoveries, technological 
advances,  changes  in  society,  natural  events  are 
likely to challenge some of the directions proposed 
today.

The strategy does not intend to “plan” for resilience, 
but  rather  to  start  engaging  with  the  City  of  Paris 
and  its  partners  on  how  to  progressively  change 
existing processes, ways of thinking and of designing 
policies and projects so as to build a more flexible, 
more responsive territory that responds proactively 
to new urban challenges.

Resilience is above all a process that aims to change 
the making of the city.

Consistent  with  the  collaborative  approach  taken 
to develop this strategy, building a resilient city will 
require  deep  involvement  of  citizens,  businesses, 
researchers  and  associations.  This  is  particularly 
important  as  most  of  the  solutions  and  answers 
to  the  challenges  of  the  century  are  already  being 
provided  by  the  civil  society  as  well  as  social  and 
technological innovators. 

We  must  also  take  better  account  of  the  issue  of 
scale. Firstly, time scale: will the infrastructure built 
today  serve  our  city  for  the  next  50  or  100  years? 
Are challenges relating to social equity and climate 
change  systematically  and  adequately  taken  into 
consideration  in  the  planning  of  our  infrastructure 
systems?  Secondly,  geographical  scale  because 
resilience-building is rarely confined to administrative 
boundaries. It is the scale of human relations at the 
level of the building’s stairwell or the neighbourhood 
that  counts  for  social  resilience;  that  of  the 
agglomeration for mobility and employment issues; 
the  geophysical  scale  of  the  watershed  to  address 
the  risks  associated  with  the  river,  and  that  of  the 
planet for climate change and mass migrations.

The  making  of  the  resilient  city,  particularly  in  a 
very dense city like Paris, must evolve to entrench 
temporary  urbanism,  modularity,  energy  sobriety 
and  reversibility  to  deliver  better  equipment  and 
public  spaces  at  lower  cost.  It  calls  for  a  true  and 
systematic consideration, both in policy objectives, 
methods and regulations for cooling, energy, water, 
biodiversity and air quality. The making of the resilient 
city must finally take an “integrated” approach that 
looks  at  how  policy  and  infrastructure  systems 
can  be  developed  as  interacting  with  one  another 
in  a  cross-cutting  way.  This  is  the  strength  of  this 
approach:  resilience  is  not  costlier,  but  rather  aims 
to  meet  more  needs  and  produce  more  benefits, 
with the same budgets.

The  road  to  resilience  is  therefore  virtuous  and 
offers remarkable opportunities for developers and 
engineers, for companies, and for the city’s citizens.”

Introduction9

Urban resilience

Resilience is the capacity of 
individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, 
and systems within a city to 
survive, adapt, and thrive no 
matter what kinds of chronic 
emergencies and acute shocks 
they experience.

Resilient  systems  are  characterised  by  seven 
qualities:
Inclusive
Based on broad consultation and engagement with 
stakeholders 

Integrated
Facilitates linkages between systems, infrastructure 
and institutions in order to maximise benefits

Reflective
Learns  from  shocks  and  disruptions  in  order  to 
become stronger

 Resourceful

Considers  different  and  more  efficient  ways  of 
using  existing  resources,  in  response  to  changing 
circumstances

 Robust

Designed to reduce risks of failure and damages in 
case of shocks or disruptions

 Redundant

Includes  spare  capacity  to  adapt  to  extreme 
conditions or unforeseen external shocks

Flexible
Can adopt alternative service delivery strategies in 
response to changing circumstances

10

Cities  in  the  21st  century  face  complex  and  inter-
dependent    crises.  This  includes  a  global  econom-
ic  system  under  great  strain;  social  and  territorial 
tensions;  ongoing  terror  threats;  rising  geopolitical 
tensions, increasing migration flows, and a leap into 
the unknown due to climate change and dwindling 
environmental  resources.  In  this  context,  a  resil-
ience-based approach is an obvious response to an 
increasingly unpredictable future. As cities are at the 
front line of all these disruptions, they must protect 
their populations against these risks.

Urban resilience aims to find effective and pragmatic 
solutions that prepare cities for expected shocks or 
stresses, as well as unforeseen challenges. This calls 
for a fundamental change in the way in which urban 
ecosystems  work,  making  them  more  flexible  and 
adaptable  to  change.  The  systemic  and  functional 
approach  advocated  by 
resilience  principles 
reinvents  urban  development  at  a  time  when  the 
share of the world’s urban population will reach 70% 
by 2050.

100  Resilient  Cities  –  Pioneered 
by  the  Rockefeller  Foundation 
(100RC)  was  launched  in  2013 
to  help  cities  around  the  world 
become more resilient to the major 
shocks  and  chronic  stresses.  The 
long-term  objective  is  a  radical 
and  large-scale  overhaul  of  how 
cities approach risk and develop.

Cities  in  the  100RC  network  are 
supported throughout the strategy 
development  and  implementation 
process with:

•  Funding for the role of a Chief 

Resilience Officer.

•  Access  to  technical  expertise 
and  methodological  guidance 
via a Strategy Partner.

•  Access to the 100RC Platform 
–  a  group  of  leading  service 
providers  who  offer  in-kind 
services to member cities.

•  Membership 

a  global 
network  of  cities  seeking  to 
build their resilience.

Agenda Setting 
Workshop

April 2016: Workshop with more 
than a hundred representatives 
from municipal departments, as 
well as economic, community, 
academic and citizen stakeholders. 
The objective was to define 
urban resilience, identify and rank 
shocks and stresses, and begin 
to understand the capacity of the 
territory to face these challenges.

October 2016: Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment of the 
territory, following consultation 
of numerous stakeholders and 
review of multiple studies and data 
available.

6 major challenges are identified:

• Social, economic and spatial 

inequalities and social cohesion;

• The terror threat and security 

context;

• Climate change;
• Air pollution and environmental 

health;

• The Seine and river-related risks; 

and

• Territorial governance.

Resilience 
challenges

The  strategy  development  process  identified  six  priority  challenges,  which  impact  the  territory  and  the 
resilience of Paris. This list of priority challenges is not exhaustive. Paris will face other risks, particularly 
related to new technologies but also nuclear risks, pandemics or epidemics, financial and oil crises, large 
scale strikes or road blockades. Ultimately, resilience means preparing for the unpredictable, preparing for 
any type of shock or stress. The priority challenges identified form the basis of the solutions presented in 
this strategy.

21

1.  Social,  economic  and  spatial 
inequalities, and social cohesion

and 

spatial 

inequalities 

Like  many  large  cities,  Paris  is  a  city  of  contrasts. 
Socioeconomic 
are 
prevalent  and  rapidly  evolving  across  the    urban 
area,  threatening  social  cohesion.  There  are  many 
dimensions  to  the  socio-economic 
inequalities 
that  plague  Paris:  precariousness  refers  to  living 
an  existence  lacking  in  predictability,  job  security, 
material  or  psychological  welfare.  This  condition 
is  no  longer  limited  to  the  isolated  and  homeless; 
families, the working poor, and migrants – who face 
additional  barriers  to  integration  –  are  increasingly 
vulnerable.   

In  Paris,  precariousness  has  manifested  is  a  spatial 
challenge.  There  has  been  a  decline  in  housing 
accessibility  and  affordability  due  to  gentrification 
and  real  estate  speculation.  In  2016  alone,  2,200 
families  were  unable  to  secure  accommodation  in 
Paris. Housing quality has also declined as vulnerable 
populations  are  pushed  into  unsafe  shelter  or 
conditions that lack basic energy infrastructure. The 
geography of vulnerability has significant secondary 
impacts  on  social  welfare.  Those  facing  social 
exclusion are often the same people with heightened 
vulnerability to health risks. 

Precariousness  is  also characterised and compounded 
by  demographic  disparities,  with  women,  children, 
the elderly, the disabled and the displaced suffering 
disproportionate  risks  of  social  exclusion.  Women 
do  not  have  the  same  opportunities  as  men:  their 
mobility,  job  opportunities  and  daily  lives  reflect 
disparate  contexts  and  constraints,  creating  and 
reinforcing  deep-rooted  gender 
inequalities. 
Children make up an increasingly large portion of the 
affected and, as the child poverty rate approaches 
22%, the wellbeing of this next generation remains a 
priority for a more resilient future.

An  aging  population  must  be  accommodated  –  if 
demographic  trends  observed  between  1997  and 
2007 continue, by the year 2030 24% of the city’s 
population will be over 60 years old and 10% will be 
over 75 years. Disability is also a challenge – in 2008, 
15% of the population of Ile-de-France was affected 
by  some  form  of  disability,  whether  identified,  felt 
or  recognised,  and  7%  were  officially  classified  as 
disabled.

territorial 

In its geographic and demographic manifestations, 
social  exclusion  can  trigger  vicious  cycles  – 
exclusion  weakens 
resilience  and 
disintegrates  the  fabric  of  human  networks, 
leading to democratic fatigue and placing growing 
pressure  on  scarce  public  resources  which  in 
turn fuels further exclusion. In response to these 
21st  century  challenges,  the  city  has  identified 
social  inclusion  and  the  fight  against  inequality, 
alongside  the  objective  of  climate  resilience,  as 
priorities for a resilient Paris.

Displaced  communities  form  a  fifth  and  growing 
group  that  suffers 
increasing  exclusion.  Since 
October 2015, on average nearly 100 migrants arrive 
in  Paris  each  day,  fleeing  geopolitical  and  climate 
induced disasters and the conflicts they generate. In 
response, Paris must assert its role as a welcoming 
European  and  global  city,  while  ensuring  the 
resilience of its most vulnerable citizens.

Pockets  of  poverty  are  concentrated  in  suburban 
neighbourhoods, especially in the north and northeast 
of  Paris.  The  “Périphérique”  (ring  road)  remains  a 
strong  physical  and  symbolic  boundary  between 
the  capital  and  the  rest  of  the  metropolitan  area, 
delineating spatial inequalities with regard to access 
to  public  transport,  government  services,  culture, 
employment  and  other  opportunities.  Intercultural 
tensions  and  heightened  security  concerns  add  to 
these  enduring  inequalities  to  further  jeopardise 
social cohesion.

2. The terror threat and security 
context

Terror  attacks  have  a  profound  psychological 
impact  and  are  perceived  by  Parisians  as  a  major 
risk.  Countering  terrorism  requires  a  wide  range 
of  actions  and  collaborative  governance  based  on 
rational  responses  and  meaningful  involvement 
from citizens.

The  events  presented  below  profoundly  affected 
Paris and its inhabitants. Each new attack in nearby 
European  cities,  such  as  Nice,  Brussels,  Berlin, 
London or Barcelona, triggers painful memories and 
serves as a reminder of the ongoing terror risk. The 
tremendous resilience of Parisians was illustrated by 
the messages of peace and solidarity that followed 
local and global attacks.

In  addition  to  the  severe  human  and  emotional 
toll,  terrorism  has  also  affected  the  economy  of 
Paris,  a  city  of  tourism.  The  retail  and  hospitality 
sectors  suffered  in  the  aftermath  of  terror  events: 
international hotel arrivals in Ile-de-France were 22% 
lower  in  December  2015,  compared  to  December 
2014.  Like  the  people  of  Paris,  the  economy  and 
tourism  sector  have  demonstrated  resilience  in 
the  months  that  followed,  benefiting  also  from  the 
support of local and national authorities committed 
to  maintaining  Paris’  role  as  a  vibrant  tourism 
destination.

In  the  aftermath  of  the  2015  and  2017  attacks, 
new  measures  were  introduced  and  implemented 
to  enhance  security  in  public  places  and  spaces. 
These steps were necessary, and were expected by 
the  population.  Rationalising  and  improving  terror 
alert  systems,  emergencies  management,  medical 
response  and  psychological  assistance  in  the  case 
of  a  terror  attack  remain  ongoing  priorities  for  the 
government,  victim  associations  and  many  others. 
They  build  on  lessons  learned  from  French  and 
international cities facing similar terror threats.

Nevertheless, there is no infallible solution that can 
fully  eradicate  the  terror  threat.  Protecting  urban 
populations  relies  above  all  on  instituting  the  right 
reactions  and  behaviour  when  emergencies  arise. 
Resilience  thus  allows  us  to  think  beyond  security 
headlines  to  the  need  for  a  more  peaceful  society 
that is marked by less inequality and provides more 
opportunities for all. The main risk to security in Paris 
is actually the potential loss of social cohesion, which 
can  result  in  intercultural  and  interfaith  tensions. 
This is why the Paris resilience strategy focuses on 
strengthening social ties and on hyperlocal solidarity, 
and  prioritises  children  and  early  civic  education. 
Wellbeing,  mental  health  and  individual  resilience 
must together be the drivers of collective resilience.

Paris Resilience Strategy3. Climate Change

“It  is  the  children  of  today,  those  playing  in  schoolyards,  who 
could endure summers at 50°C”

Jean Jouzel, Climatologue

Average  temperatures  in  Paris  are  set  to  rise 
by  2°C  to  4°C  in  the  coming  decades,  requiring 
preparedness for risks such as heatwaves, droughts, 
violent storms, flooding, and water scarcity.  

For the first time in 2017, the city’s “heatwave plan” 
was  triggered  in  June  during  the  school  term  as 
temperatures  climbed  in  June  2017  –  an  event 
that is likely to increase in frequency, duration and 
intensity due to climate change. A few weeks later 
exceptional rainfall led to extensive damage and the 
temporary closure of several underground stations: 
the city experienced nearly 50mm of rainfall in just 
one hour, a level unprecedented since the installation 
of rainfall monitoring stations by Météo France. This 
type  of  intense  and  localised  rainfall  is  becoming 
more  common  across  the  globe,  necessitating 
adaptive infrastructure. 

Climate  change  thus  already  has  tangible  impacts 
for  Paris  and  the  city  needs  to  mitigate  and  adapt 

to  these  in  the  short,  medium  and  long-term.  For 
example,  our  urban  infrastructure,  networks  and 
services  are  highly  vulnerable  to  extreme  weather 
events, while our natural environment is under stress 
from  high  temperatures  and  the  urban  heat  island 
effect,  which  can  also  worsen  air  quality  issues  in 
Paris. In this context, the most vulnerable individuals 
are disproportionately affected: children, the elderly, 
the  sick,  and  those  on  the  streets.  While  the  2003 
heatwave  caused  an  estimated  15,000  deaths  in 
France – including nearly 1,100 in Paris – the June 2017 
heatwave  caused  580  additional  deaths  nationally. 
This  suggests  public  policies  have  been  effective 
to  some  extent,  but  they  may  not  be  the  most 
efficient  approach  given  the  increasing  frequency 
and  intensity  of  recurring  climatic  events  and  the 
disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. 
This is why action against social exclusion and action 
against  climate  change  are  intrinsically  linked,  and 
why solidarity remains a priority for the resilience of 
the territory.

Air  pollution  now  joins  alcohol  and  tobacco  as  the 
primary  health  risk  for  Parisians:  70%  of  the  city’s 
citizens  are  exposed  to  polluted  air,  despite  some 
improvement over the last decade (AirParif, 2015).

Air  pollution  has  multiple,  complex  and  severe 
consequences  for  the  health  and  wellbeing  of 
Parisians.  The  immediate  impacts  of  pollution  may 
include  irritation  of  the  eyes  and  respiratory  tract, 
asthma attacks, and exacerbation of cardiovascular 
and  respiratory  disorders  that  may 
lead  to 
hospitalisation  or  death  in  the  most  severe  cases.  
Long-term  effects  due  to  repeated  or  continuous 
exposure  may  lead  to  the  worsening  of  diseases 
such  as  cancer  (World  Health  Organization,  2013), 
cardiovascular  and 
respiratory  diseases,  and 
neurological or developmental disorders.

The economic costs of air pollution are significantly 
underestimated because the health impacts are not 
yet  fully  understood.  However,  even  beyond  the 
significant human health risks, air pollution generates 
many  physical  costs  such  as:  increased  building 
maintenance; economic losses linked to absenteeism 
and  productivity  loss;  and  environmental  damage  
that  are  difficult  to  reverse,  still  poorly  researched 
and rarely quantified.

In Paris, air pollution is mainly caused by road traffic, 
as well as  residential and commercial heating. Road 
traffic  generates  almost  two-thirds  of  nitrogen 
oxides  (NOx)  emissions  and  more  than  half  of 
fine  particulate  (PM10  and  PM2.5)  emissions.  The 
residential  and  services  sectors  are  the  primary 
sources  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and 
sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  emissions.  These  sectors  also 
contribute air pollutant emissions such as NOx and 
fine particulate matter. 

The  Paris  urban  area  is  crossed  by  the  largest 
motorway  hub  in  Europe:  the  “Périphérique”  (ring 
road).  Here,  no  fewer  than  nine  motorways  and 
expressways  converge  at  a  point  that  is  less  than 
4  km  from  the  heart  of  Paris.  With  more  than  one

most  vulnerable.  Improving  air  quality  is  therefore 
a major challenge for health and resilience. A more 
resilient city requires improved air quality by taking 
back urban spaces occupied by road traffic.

million users every day and making up 40% of road 
traffic in Paris, the “Périphérique” is the most polluting 
infrastructure  in  Ile-de-France  and  contributes  to 
37% of the region’s NOx and 35% of fine particulate 
(PM10) emissions. 

While  media  attention  tends  to  focus  on  pollution 
peaks, health impacts are mostly caused by chronic 
exposure.  Inhabitants  of  the  metropolitan  area  are 
exposed  to  poor  air  quality  each  day,  and  some 
–  including  children,  the  elderly  and  those  with 
respiratory and/or cardiovascular diseases – are the

5. The Seine and river-related 
risks

In Paris, the effects of climate change on the Seine 
basin  are  already  tangible:  Paris  experienced  a 
severe  and  unprecedented  flood  in  June  2016  and 
equally extreme and premature low water levels in 
the same period the following year. For this reason, 
the  Seine  was  identified  early  on  as  one  of  the 
priority resilience challenges for the capital.

In  particular,  Paris  must  prepare  for  the  risk  of  a 
major flood equivalent to or worse than that of 1910. 
The  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
Development  has estimated that the direct cost of a 
centennial flood in Paris could reach 30 billion euros 
in public and private capital losses, while the direct 
costs to the economy could exceed 60 billion euros 
with 430,000 jobs directly at risk. As a result of the 
intensive urbanisation of the Seine riverbed (60% of 
floodplains  have  been  built  upon)  and  the  scaling 
of  urban  networks  and  services  without  sufficient 
accounting  for  river-related  risks,  the  territory’s 
ability to operate and deliver public services will be 
severely  impacted.  The  2016  flood  made  this  risk 
tangible for all, highlighting a range of technical and 
organisational vulnerabilities for the territory.

The  risk  of  low  water  levels  in  the  Seine  and  the 
worsening  scarcity  of  water  resources  is  another 
major and emerging climate-related challenge. The 
phenomenon of severe droughts raises the issue of 
stable  water  supply  for  Paris  and  the  surrounding 
region,  both  for  potable  water,  and  also  for 
agriculture,  industry  and  river  operations.  In  2016, 
55% of water supply in the capital was derived from 
groundwater  sources  and  45%  from  surface  water

(specifically, the Seine and Marne rivers). There are 
concerns that the flow of the Seine and its tributaries 
could be reduced by 30% by 2080.

Improving  water  quality  is  also  a  priority.  This 
refers  both  to  supply,  as  well  as  water  needed 
for  biodiversity,  recreation  (e.g.  swimming)  and 
cooling  of  our  city  during  heatwaves.  Coping  with 

these  multiple  risks  requires  an  understanding 
of  the  interdependencies  at  the  level  of  the  Seine 
watershed,  and  not  just  at  the  level  of  the  City  of 
Paris.  Close  cooperation  between  the  relevant 
regional  organisations  and  territories  is  imperative 
to prevent and manage river-related risks.

6. Territorial governance

In  order  to  respond  to  each  of  the  challenges 
mentioned above, it is necessary to operate beyond 
the  administrative  boundaries  of  the  City  of  Paris, 
transcending municipal organisational structures and 
territorial  division.  Resilience  requires  mobilisation 
of  all  stakeholders,  resources  and  ideas,  as  well  as 
organisational adaptation and cooperation between 
territories  that  are  increasingly  interdependent. 
Governance  is  therefore  a  priority  challenge  within 
this resilience strategy.

Effective governance requires a strong relationship 
between  the  city  and  its  stakeholders  as  well  as  a 
profound  capacity  for  government  to  innovate, 
experiment and involve private operators upstream 
in  the  design  of  its  projects.  Such  cooperative 
governance  will  ensure  maximal  resources  are 
dedicated to the resilience of the territory.

The city‘s administrative structures must also adapt 
to local changes if we are to guarantee the quality 
and continuity of public services despite disruptions. 
The  City  of  Paris,  affected  by  exogenous  and 
endogenous  risks,  must  constantly  improve  its 
responses  to  disasters  and  everyday  emergencies 

and  commit  each  of  its  employees  to  continually 
learn, train and innovate.

A capital city of 2.2 million inhabitants, Paris sits at the 
heart of a region of 10.5 million people. It relies on rural 
communities  well  beyond  the  urban  area  for  food, 
transport, and labour. This broader, interdependent, 
network highlights the need for cooperation across 
local authorities for a resilient approach. The Greater 
Paris  Metropolis  (GMP),  which  is  home  to  7  million 
people, was created in 2016 and today is responsible 
for:  economic,  social  and  cultural  development; 
urban  planning  at  the  metropolitan  level;  housing 
policy, and environmental protection and policy. In 
this  context,  the  development  of  a  common  vision 
and  resilience  solutions  across  different  territorial 
tiers (e.g. boroughs, city, metropolitan area, regions, 
state,) remains absolutely essential for the wellbeing 
of the collective region.

Paris Resilience StrategyDriven  by  its  motto  “Fluctuat  Nec  Mergitur”,  and 
as  demonstrated  throughout  history  during  events 
such  as  the  great  flood  of  1910,  Paris  has  shown 
time after time its ability to emerge stronger when 
confronted  with  major  events.  The  terror  attacks 
in  2015  reaffirmed  once  more  the  tremendous 
resilience of the city and its inhabitants.  

Our vision is to continue to reinforce and promote 
these  characteristics  by  considering  the  city’s 
development  and  the  21st  century  challenges  it 
faces through the lens of resilience. Such challenges 
include  the  consequences  of  climate  change  (such 
as  flooding  and  heatwaves),  the  health  impacts  of 
pollution  and  environmental  degradation,  resource 
scarcity,  and  broadening  inequalities,  which  pose 
risks to the social and democratic order, as well as 
to security and stability of the city both in the long 
and short terms.

In  our  resilience  vision,  these  risks  are  looked  at  in 
a  holistic  and  inclusive  way.    A  holistic  approach 
contends  that  is  more  efficient  to  build  integrated 
solutions  that  respond  to  climate,  social  and 
environmental  emergencies  together,  rather  than 
separately. Public policy, from building infrastructure 
or  equipment  to  setting  up  new  services,  must 
integrate  from  the  outset  the 
imperatives  of 
mitigation  and  adaptation  to  global  warming  and 
reduction of inequalities.

Paris  is  already  a  world  leader  in  the  fields  of 
climate  adaptation  and  the  fight  against  exclusion. 
By focusing on resilience, the city is creating a new 
urban  development  model  that  is  more  flexible, 
more ingenious, more efficient and adaptable to the 
hazardous changes of the world.

Stratégie de résilience de Paris
Paris Resilience Strategy

Action plan

Pillar 1 

A. Prepare young and old to cope with 
acute shocks and daily stresses

An inclusive and cohesive city, which builds on 
the strength of its residents to become more 

resilient

The approach must be inclusive because resilience only works if 
everyone participates: public institutions, private stakeholders, 
associations, inhabitants, researchers, and other city users. The 
more inclusive a society, the more it is united and supportive, 
and  the  more  it  can  face  all  eventualities,  daily  as  well  as  in 
emergencies.  Resilience  is  therefore  firmly  people-centred, 
driven by all citizens and communities, and with a focus on the 
interests of children. 

Pillar 2

A city built and developed to meet the 

challenges of the 21st century

Resilience also calls for a different approach to urban spaces 
and  infrastructure  in  order  to  respond  to  challenges  in  an 
integrated, tactical and flexible way:

Integrated, so as to address all risks at the same time through 
cooperation across silos, in order to achieve long-term benefits

Tactical,  because  small  scale  actions  can  serve  broad  and 
ambitious goals by exploring new areas

Flexible,  because  public  spaces,  buildings  and  heritage  sites 
are  all  places  to  innovate,  absorb  shocks  and  react  to  the 
unpredictable  in  a  dense  city,  thanks  to  reversible,  modular, 
temporary solutions.

B. Create conditions that encourage 
goodwill among neighbours and inclusive 
neighbourhoods 

C. Enable residents to co-create the city of 
tomorrow

A. Anticipate risks and adapt infrastructure

B. Design infrastructure that creates 
multiple benefits

C. Promote resilient urbanism in a dense city

Pillar 3

A. Mobilise collective intelligence and 
resources

A city in transition that mobilises collective 

intelligence, adapts its operations, and 

cooperates with its surrounding territories

collective 
Finally, 
intelligence  of  citizens,  associations  and  businesses

A strategy based on cross-
cutting projects

change; 

The  City  of  Paris  is  acting  on 
multiple  fronts  to  address  its 
priority challenges. Many cross-
cutting  strategies  and  public 
policies  have  been  developed 
to:  mitigate  and  adapt  to 
climate 
improve 
environmental  quality 
and 
mobility;  increase  biodiversity; 
improve  opportunities 
for 
citizens  through  engagement; 
strengthen social cohesion and 
solidarity  between  territories 
and  generations;  promote 
responsible  production  and 
consumption 
systems;  and 
support the circular economy. 

The  resilience  strategy  builds 
on  these  actions,  especially 
on  the  climate  adaptation 
strategy  voted  in  December 
2015  which 
launched  Paris’ 
approach to urban resilience. 

This resilience strategy aims to 
enhance the existing measures 
and  policies,  maximise  their 
co-benefits  and  pool 
the 
resources  that  contribute  to 
this common agenda.

The fight against social exclusion is the Great 
Cause of the 2014-2020 mayoral term. A pact 
was signed between representatives from 450 
charities,  businesses,  the  State,  the  City  and 
vulnerable  individuals.  Three  priorities  were 
identified  to  support  individuals;  improve 
early  warning  of  social  exclusion;  intervene 
more  effectively  with  vulnerable  individuals; 
and long term reinsertion in society.

Getting Prepared 

Getting Involved

A  resilient  city  is  also  a  city  that  enables  and 
promotes  citizens’  initiatives.  For      institutions  to 
acquire  a  culture  of  prevention,  society  must  first 
adopt a culture of action. In this sense, it is essential 
to  inform  and  invite  citizens  to  co-construct  and 
participate in the implementation of public policies. 
Tactical  urbanism  tools  and  new  technologies  can 
help catalyse citizen interventions.

Collective resilience rests first and foremost on each 
individual being prepared to face acute shocks and 
chronic  stresses.  This  involves  the  mobilisation  of 
voluntary  citizen  networks,  the  deployment  of  a 
wide-ranging  and  accessible  training  programmes, 
psychological  assistance  for  citizens  in  case  of 
emergency  and  support  for  parents.  To  this  end, 
Paris will have the tools to inform, train and involve 
youth  and  adults  in  the  construction  of  a  more 
resilient city.

Engaging Neighbours

A city that is united and supportive is a more resilient 
city, where goodwill and conviviality further enhance 
individual  and  collective  resilience.  This  requires 
maintaining  and  strengthening  social  cohesion  by 
creating  opportunities,  places  and  projects,  which 
support  social  links  and  connectivity.  The  goal  is 
to  protect  one  another  because  we  “have  become 
united by the risks that we impose on one another” 
(Bruno Latour).

Action 1

Mobilise a citizen reserve network to support crisis 
management and daily resilience building efforts 

cities, 

traditional 

emergency 
Unlike  many 
management  in  Paris  leaves  little  room  for  citizen 
involvement.  Yet,  during  the  attacks  of  November 
2015,  hundreds  of  people  offered  their  services, 
and  the  exemplary  behaviour  of  shopkeepers  and 
neighbours adjacent to the sites of the attacks, before 
the arrival of the emergency services, demonstrates 
how valuable citizen assistance can be in the event 
of a disaster… as well as in daily life.  

The  City  of  Paris  will  create  a  network  of  citizens 
whose role is to coordinate with emergency actors 
on  the  ground  in  the  event  of  a  major  crisis.  They 
will  also  work  to  maintain  an  ongoing    relationship 
to strengthen solidarity among citizens so they can 
understand, get involved in and take action to build 
resilience. 

Trained  in  first  aid  and  crisis  management  by 
Paris  firefighters  and  civil  security  associations, 
this  network  will  play  a  major  role  in  prevention, 
crisis  management  and  recovery,  to  amplify  and 
support  the  efforts  of  public  authorities.  It  will 
also  be  used  in  non-crisis  situations  to  support 
associations  and  to  take  part  in  awareness-raising 
events,  etc.  The  network  will  build  on  the  City’s 
existing  citizen  participation  platforms  such  as  the 
Paris  citizen  card  and  mobilise  civic  services  and 
voluntary ambassadors at the neighbourhood level 
beginning in 2018. This network will be designed in 
partnership  with  organisations  with  rapid  response 
resources  or  volunteering  employees  (RATP,  AP-
HP,  etc.),  in  conjunction  with  the  Paris  solidary 
reserve  and  approved  civil  security  associations.  It 
will  rely  on  local  networks  for  neighbourhood  and 
citizen participation and it may be mobilised at the 
metropolitan scale and beyond.

The  Paris  citizen  card  was  launched  in  2016 
after  the  Charlie  Hebdo  terror  attack.  The 
card  allows  residents  to  access  a  range  of 
educational, civic and cultural services. It opens 
the door to the City Council and allows citizens 
to  meet  with  elected  officials.  The  existing 
150,000  cardholders  will  now  have  access  to 
training and be able to participate in building a 
more resilient city.

Action 2

Deploy wide-ranging, interactive first aid and risk 
management training

is  poorly  developed 

Risk  culture 
in  France 
compared  to  other  countries,  and  often  takes  an 
“administrative”  approach.  Such  an  approach  may 
generate anxiety in citizens even though information 
about  potential  risks  and  emergency  behaviours  is 
crucial for strengthening resilience. 

The City of Paris plans to expand the “Paris Saves” 
initiative by: increasing the number of defibrillators 
in  public  spaces;  expanding  first  aid  and  risk 
management  training  to  include  major  climatic 
events,  and  furthering  education  on  health  and 
environmental  risks.  The  objective  is  that  by  2030, 
90% of Parisians will be trained in first aid and risk 
management to enable them to save lives. Paris also 
plans  to  develop  a  training  programme  for  adults 

and  children,  which  is  focused  on  actions  they  can 
take in the event of a major disaster (self-protection 
kit). This will include citizen participation in exercises 
organised by risk prevention and crisis management 
services. The City will also support the development 
of simulation exercises such as “serious game”, run 
interactive  and  playful  challenges  to  encourage 
behaviour  change,  and  organise  events  for  youth 
and  adults.  Finally,  as  part  of  the  Participatory 
Budget  for  schools,  extra-curricular  programmes 
will  be  developed  in  partnership  with  the  Ministry 
of  Education,  so  that  schools  can  become  a  prime 
space for the city in transition.

Paris qui sauve: Paris Saves

After  the  November  2015  attacks,  thousands 
of Parisians asked to be trained in first aid so 
that they would know how to respond in the 
event  of  a  crisis.  It  is  estimated  that  if  20% 
of  French  citizens  received  basic  emergency 
response  skills,  10,000  lives  could  be  saved 
each  year.  In  response,  the  City  of  Paris  has 
developed  a  programme  known  as  “Paris  qui 
Sauve”  or  “Paris  Saves”.  The  City  is  working 
with its partners to create further initiatives for 
citizens,  install  defibrillators  in  public  places 
and offer first aid training.

Action 3

Ensure psychological support for all City residents 
after a shock to strengthen social cohesion and 
preserve health

Psychological resilience is a priority in cities where 
threats,  terror  ones  in  particular,  are  a  significant 
risk to social cohesion, wellbeing and mental health. 
Existing support measures have been strengthened 
by  both  State  and  local  authorities,  but  they  only 
relate to victims, their relatives or individuals directly 
involved. These measures do not extend to the wider 
population,  which  is  also  deeply  affected  by  these 
events  and  may  be  susceptible  to  post-traumatic 
stress. 

to  provide 

This  strategy  proposes  the  deployment  of  a 
City-wide  programme 
long-term 
psychological support in the event of a major shock 
at  the  local  level  in  partnership  with  the  Medico-
Psychological  Emergency  Unit  and  the  Parisian 
Mobile 
Intervention  Unit.  This  programme  will 
specifically  target  City  municipal  employees  who 
are in regular and frequent contact with the public. 
Training greatly reduces the risk of developing post-
traumatic stress, helps build long-term resilience to 
shocks and allows those affected to help others. A 
specific module will be developed in the short-term 
to  reassure  the  education  community,  in  particular 

with regards to terror threats. Through educational 
tools and videos, the module will help parents and 
school staff talk to children about terrorism. 

Implementation

First step(s) 

Short-term  –  Develop  and 
the 
psychological support programme open to all and 
of  the  specific  module  for  volunteering  schools; 
plan for a specific communication campaign.

Paris Resilience StrategyPillar I - Objective A

Action 4

Strengthen support for parents and families and 
help the education community deal with trauma and 
daily stress

This action proposes to create more safe spaces and 
opportunities for dialogue between parents; between 
parents and children; and between parents, children 
and teachers; so that they have safe spaces to discuss 
challenges. This also involves supporting parents in 
reconciling their professional, domestic and personal 
lives  (by  developing  new  services  dedicated  to 
young  children,  taking  action  to  change  the  work 
environment,  etc.).  Finally,  the  City  will  increase 
the  number  of  anticipated  and  targeted  parenting 
support  measures,  which  will  consist  of  listening 
and offering resources to parents, supporting them 
to become better parents. Specific attention will be 
paid during periods of domestic stress (behavioural 
disorders, risky behaviours, psychological disorders, 
substance  abuse,  absenteeism,  academic  failure, 
petty crime, parental separation, mourning of a child 
or parent, etc.).

Paris in action: The strategy  “Making 
Paris the City of Children and Families”

 aims to support every Parisian parent, from the 
birth of their child to the time when they gain 
independence, on a daily basis as well as in the 
case of severe difficulties (mourning, parental 
separation,  trauma,  etc.).    In  this  context,  the 
City  has  set  up  services,  places  of  exchange 
between  parents  or  between  parents  and 
children,  as  well  as  solidarity  networks  and 
sponsorship.

Implementation

First step(s) 

Short-term  –  Experiment  “primary  prevention” 
and  deploy  child-care  space;  research  actions  to 
experiment innovative solutions devised by families 
and professionals on the ground; mobilise resources 
and  psychological  reinforcements  in  ten  priority 
schools from the programme “all mobilised”.

Action 5

Increase daily solidarity measures by facilitating 
links between those who want to get involved and 
those who need help 

By  relying  on  community  networks,  businesses 
and  leaders  of  social  innovation,  the  City  wants  to 
create  new  local  networks  to  connect  supply  (i.e. 
volunteers)  with  demand  (for  food,  basic  needs 
products,  mutual  aid  services)  on  a  simplified  and 
daily basis.

The  action  will  provide  a  platform  connected  to 
social and community practices, with an interactive 
mapping of geo-localised initiatives and tools (such 
as  solidarity  guide,  services  map,  access  to  legal 
support, health services, etc.). This will be facilitated 
by local municipal services and the voluntary sector, 
as  part  of  implementing  Participatory  Budget–
funded projects. Several entities will lead, including 
citizens  whose  project  proposals  were  approved, 
working  groups  on  food  aid  and  web  developers. 
This will foster improved and real-time links between 
technology  tools,  events  and  association  input 
(focusing on street furniture, public pantries, lockers, 
refrigerators,  associations’  premises,  modular  and 

mobile spaces) with businesses active in their local 
economy. 

Implementation

First step(s) 

Short-term – Organise working groups with citizens 
and  associations;  web  design  and  launch  of  the 
platform.

Action 6

Encourage neighbours, youth and adults to 
temporarily occupy public spaces

Streets, parks and squares are meeting places where 
several  citizen  initiatives  are  already  developing 
(neighbourhood  block  parties,  etc.).  Nevertheless, 
in  daily  life  and  in  a  very  dense  city,  there  are  few 
spaces available to encourage these neighbourhood 
interactions.  However,  many  public  facilities  could 
meet this demand for space outside of their opening 
hours, and these newly created public spaces could 
accommodate  more  community  meetings  and 
events,  further  promoting  social  connection  and 
cohesion. 

The  strategy  proposes  that  each  arrondissement 
(district)  develops  existing  mechanisms  (such  as 
mobile  libraries,  citizen  kiosks);  specific  actions 
(such as organising a car free day, the Paris Breathes 
scheme);  and  facilitates  local  citizen  initiatives  by 
developing  and  improving  platforms  for  booking 
public  spaces.  This  will  require  cleaning,  security 
and  other  responsibilities  to  be  adapted  according 
to the type of events. Training will be proposed to 
community groups. In addition, schools are regarded 
as the most widespread public asset across the City. 
Therefore,  volunteering  schools  will  serve  as  pilots 
by  opening  during  off-peak  hours,  entrusting  their 
management  (access,  security,  cleaning,  etc.)  to 
parents or neighbourhood groups, or to members of 

the citizen reserve network (see Action 1). Depending 
on  its  success,  this  initiative  may  be  extended  to 
other  schools  and  facilities  (sport  fields,  libraries, 
etc.). 

Implementation

First step(s) 

–  Establish  a  committee 

Short-Term 
for 
programming  public  space  events  and  define 
events  typology;  record  and  map  public  spaces 
and  create  a  sharing  platform;  develop  games  in 
public  spaces  through  the  deployment  of  mobile 
libraries  and  pilot  citizen  participation  in  the  use 
and management of these structures.

Action 7

Support the creation of new community-focused local 
jobs 

The  City  of  Paris  intends  to  build  on  community 
interactions to foster social inclusion and to create 
new activities. The aim is to set up a neighbourhood 
manager position, as a relay for benevolent actions 
and a lead for social and climate resilience objectives 
at the local level. 

The City will support two programmes, which will be 
evaluated to develop best practice models:

The  creation  of  an  eco-administrator 
1. 
position, shared between a tertiary building, a social 
landlord,  an  apartment  co-ownership  building  and 
its facilities, whose role will be to communicate with 
technical service providers, to support stakeholders 
in  achieving  energy  consumption  targets,  and  to 
aggregate environmental and energy objectives. 

The  Paris  Housing  (“Paris  Habitat”)  study 
2. 
on  the  evolution  of  the  concierge  profession.  A 
pilot project with the Paris Fire Brigade is proposed 
to  involve  concierges  in  risk  prevention  and  the 
dissemination  of  risk  education  (first  aid  training, 
defibrillator  use,  the  assistance  to  vulnerable 
individuals  in  case  of  a  major  event,  etc.).  The 
concierges will also coordinate local gatherings and 
community-led actions.

Action 8

Support initiatives, implementation and co-funding 
of resilience solutions by individuals and local 
stakeholders

The greening permit, established by the City of Paris, 
has generated a lot of enthusiasm among Parisians. 
It allows volunteers to independently manage green 
public spaces. This initiative, which aims to involve 
citizens directly in the implementation of solutions, 
is  a  driving  force  for  participation,  civic  duty  and 
resilience at the local scale. 

The  City  of  Paris  will  set  up  tools  to  facilitate, 
support  and  co-finance 
the  participation  of 
citizens  and  private  actors  in  the  implementation 
of resilience solutions, related to climate and social 
issues. Steered by the City of Paris and its partners, 
private 
individuals  and  companies  owning  or 
managing  various  spaces  (walls,  roofs,  balconies, 
inner  courtyards,  buildings’  ground  floors,  parking 
places etc.) will benefit from tools (urban heat island 
mapping,  rainfall  zoning,  etc.)  and  be  supported 
(technical  assistance,  funding  finance)  to  install 
these solutions (increase of green spaces, rainwater 
harvesting, pantries, compost bins, rain barrels, etc.). 

The new “Végétalisons Paris” platform, the greening 
permit,  the  Participatory  Budget,  the  bartering 
or  non-monetary  exchange  platforms 
(time 
vouchers,  eco-rewards,  etc.),  crowdfunding  and 
crowdlending will be mobilised to develop a flexible 
and  collaborative  system  relying  on  existing  tools. 

The  City  will  also  explore  incentives  to  encourage 
citizens’ contributions to urban resilience.

Implementation

First step(s) 

– 

Integrate  private 

Short-term 
individuals’ 
involvement  in  the  future  Rain  Plan;  set  up  a 
strategy  to  encourage  crowdfunding;  design 
guides to install solutions

Short-term - Design guides / manuals and integrate 
new features / solutions.

Medium term – The City provides tools / equipment 
such as rain barrels, bins, etc.

Action 9

Standardise temporary and small-scale 
interventions to liven, re-invent and transform 
urban spaces with citizens

Tactical  urban  planning  refers  to  a  city  and  /  or  a 
citizen-led approach to neighbourhood building using 
short-term,  low-cost,  and  scalable  interventions  to 
catalyse long-term change. It involves the activation 
of  urban  spaces  in  the  short-term,  while  planning 
urban  transformation  projects  over  the  long-term. 
This  is  in  the  context  of  a  dense  city  where  open 
spaces  are  lacking  and  where  the  management  of 
public  spaces  is  a  challenge  for  quality  of  life  and 
social cohesion.

The  City  of  Paris  will  evaluate  the  impact  and  the 
model  of  the  participative  workshops  led  with  and 
by  citizens  of  the  city’s  squares  including:  Vanves 
gate square, the Little Railway Belt, and seven of the 
city’s square/roundabout sites. Following these initial 
pilots,  the  City  will  design  an  urban  development 
programme 
interventions, 
based on the wishes expressed by the citizens and 
on a catalogue of solutions for the City’s operational 
departments  and  local  arrondissement  (district) 
administrations.  This  will  include  “tactical”  tools 
(events,  temporary  occupation,  temporary  street 
furniture), identifying potential barriers, constraints 

through  small-scale 

as well as opportunities. The City plans to mobilise 
these resources to transform the gates of Paris and, 
in  time,  major  infrastructure  such  as  the  ring  road 
(“Périphérique”).  Citizens from neighbouring towns 
will be invited to participate where appropriate.

Implementation

First step(s) 

Short-term – Develop a catalogue of “tactical” urban 
planning  solutions;  hold  participatory  workshops 
for  the  Petite  Ceinture  and  Seven  Squares,  and 
assess.

Medium-term  –  Liven  up  and  promote  the 
Bruneseau  site  through  urban  experimentation; 
event on the ringroad (“Péripherique”)

The  Resilience  Strategy  takes  into  account 
the  migratory  phenomenon  in  a  cross-cutting  way: 
conviviality  at  the 
level,  the  simplification 
of  goodwill  everyday  gestures,  support  for  local 
professions  (pillar

International Rescue Committee in Paris

In spring 2017, the International Rescue Committee, a 
100RC  Platform  Partner,  conducted  a  study  on  Paris’ 
current responses to migration issues, with a wide range 
of  stakeholders.  Two  main  medium-  and  long-term 
challenges were identified: promoting social inclusion 
at  the  neighbourhood  level  through  the  involvement 
of 
local  stakeholders  (businesses,  entrepreneurs, 
neighbours),  and  public  services  at  the  micro-local 
level  to  propose  integration  measures  (welcoming 
migrants,  employment,  housing,  citizenship).  Building 
people’s  autonomy  by  ensuring  safety,  health  and 
wellbeing,  education,  workforce  integration,  to  allow 
everyone to choose their life paths in the city.

challenge.  Climate  change,  according  to  the 
United  Nations,  could  cause  the  displacement 
of  250  million  people  by  2050.  Cities  will  have 
to be prepared to accommodate more migrants 
and  face  additional  pressure  on  resources,  and 
increased  need  for  housing,  infrastructure  and 
services.  The  social  and  professional  integration 
and  the  adaptation  of  urban  projects  to  the 
migration  challenges  are  therefore  resilience 
issues.  The  City  of  Paris  has  worked  with  seven 
other member cities from the 100RC network in 
Athens to define common principles and develop

The mobilisation of the City of Paris for 
the arrival of refugees

Since  2015,  Paris  has  been  experiencing    mass 
influx  of  people  fleeing  geo-political  conflicts  and 
climatic events. The City set two reception centres 
to respond to this emergency. The first one, located 
at Porte de la Chapelle, sheltered more than 15,000 
people. A plan to mobilise the Paris community was 
adopted in 2015 and established several principles: 
equal  rights  and  treatment  of  all  people  on  the 
streets,  Paris’  mobilisation  is  that  of  the  Parisians, 
and emergency response is interlinked with planning 
for the future.

Paris Resilience Strategy

A city built and developed 
to meet the challenges of 
the 21st century

The City of Paris is leading numerous programmes 
aimed at adapting the city to its resilience challenges. 
Key  areas  of  municipal  action  include:  responding 
to climate and social challenges, promoting nature-
based  solutions  and  biodiversity,  and  integrating 
new water uses. The Resilience Strategy addresses 
these  challenges  in  a  systematic  and  integrated 
manner. 
Adapt.  If  citizens  are  the  cornerstone  of  urban 
resilience, it is also essential to adapt infrastructure 
and  urban  networks  to  the  risks  that  threaten 
them.  Paris  faces  significant  climate  change  and 
environmental risks (future increase in the number, 
frequency and intensity of heatwaves, major floods, 
intense  rainfall  events,  frequent  pollution  peaks, 
etc.) and must therefore adapt. Protecting the most 
vulnerable groups from these threats and adapting 
the  City’s  infrastructure  to  their  specific  needs  are 
equally important objectives.
Multiply  benefits.  The  City  manages  public 
spaces  and  facilities,  urban  networks  and  services, 
and ensures that they meet the City’s needs. In the 
long  run,  a  resilient  approach  calls  for  thinking  in 
an integrated manner and assessing, at each stage, 
the  multiple  benefits  which  could  be  delivered 
by 
its  primary  function. 
Multifunctional,  modular,  flexible,  redundant—these 
are  some  of  the  key  principles  which  must  be 
embedded  in  infrastructure  planning  to  accelerate 
this transition and guarantee inclusivity.

Explore.  Paris  is  a  dense  city.  In  this  context, 
urban  planning  offers 
immense  opportunities 
for  innovation  and  action  aimed  at  exploring  the 
City’  resources,  including  its  underground,  roofs 
and  vacant  spaces  for  renewing  the  design  and 
construction  processes.  Therefore,  it  is  fitting,  in 
the  early  years  of  this  century,  to  adapt  choices 
and practices to implement a temporary urbanism, 
to  build  adapted  neighbourhoods  and  to  make 
resilience an accelerator for urban innovation. 

The  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Strategy, 
adopted  at  the  end  of  2015,  is  Paris’  first 
resilience  strategy.  It  comprises  four  pillars: 
protecting  Parisians  from  extreme    climate 
events; guaranteeing access to water, food and 
energy; living with climate change: sustainable 
urbanism;  and  supporting  new  ways  of  life 
and  strengthening  solidarity.  The  Resilience 
Strategy  presented  here  aims  to  accelerate 
the Plan’s implementation.

Action 10

Transform schoolyards into cooling island “oases”

Since  adopting  its  Climate  Change  Adaptation 
Strategy, Paris has launched several initiatives aimed 
at adapting urban spaces to high temperatures. It is 
creating more islands and cooling paths, new green 
and natural open spaces for protecting biodiversity 
as well as developing a cooling network.  

Paris  schoolyards,  which  represent  a  total  of  more 
than  600,000m2²  (800,000m2² 
if  the  middle 
schools (“collèges”) are included) are covered with 
impermeable  asphalt  and  closed  to  the  general 
public  even  outside  school  hours.  However,  with 
very  few  Parisians  living  more  than  200m  away 
from  a  schoolyard  and  given  that  they  are  easily 
identifiable by all, schoolyards could be transformed 
into a true « oasis » for cooling and wellbeing.

In  June  2017,  the  City  activated  its  Emergency 
Heatwave  Plan.  It  was  the  first  time  such  a  drastic 
event had occurred so early in the year and during 
the school term. A critical short-term action would 
be  to  respond  to  such  emergency  by  installing 
various  equipment  (such  as  curtains,  mist  sprays, 
shading)  to  cool  schooldyards  and  to  finalise  a 
school-specific Heatwave Plan, similar to the one in 
place for the elderly, alongside the opening of public 
cooling  rooms.  These  would  be  operational  at  the 
start of the 2018 school year and propose alternative 
solutions  in  the  event  of  heatwaves  (adaptating 
personal activities, moving to cool places, etc.). In the 
medium- to long-term, a cooling programme for all 
schools will be implemented. It will aim to gradually 

replace asphalt walkways with trees and vegetation 
(lawns, orchards, vegetable gardens), and / or test 
new  materials  (stabilised  materials,  recycled  wood, 
kinetic  tiles,  evapotranspiration  and  permeable 
coating, etc.) and new methods to cool schoolyards 
and  /  or  dormitories  (district  energy,  earth  tubes, 
solar absorption cooling, etc.). The schoolyards will 
become  places  for  learning  (educational  gardens), 
for improved wellbeing, etc. These processes will be 
defined  and  piloted  before  being  replicated  across 
the City. 

Implementation

First steps(s) 

Short-term  –  Select  pilot  site(s)  for  removing 
asphalt / cooling; assess the potential opportunity 
and implement the projects co-construction tools 
with  the  education  community;  deliver  the  first 
cooled schoolyard for the new 2018 school year. 

Medium-term  –  Assess  results  and  roll  out  the 
programme to other schools.

since  the  20th  century,  act  as  cooling  islands 
for  the  city  and  are  currently  being  managed  by 
the  municipality’s  Department  of  Environmental 
Protection and Public Gardens. 

In  2011,  the  municipality  created  the  programme, 
“Educational  Gardens”,  an  environmental  education 
project for the entire education community, managed 
collectively, involving children, but also students and 
seniors.

In the wake of a major shock, cities are increasingly 
pressured  to  rapidly  return  to  normal  and  restore 
infrastructure.  This  push  to  build  back  quickly  has 
resulted  in  many  cities  recreating  the  same  pre-
disaster vulnerabilities. Resilience thinking does not 
solely  aim  to  reinstate  what  was  destroyed  but  it 
looks at how disasters can turn into an opportunity 
to reconstruct more robust infrastructure capable of 
withstanding similar shocks in the future. 

It is proposed to carry out an audit of a representative 
part  of  the  City’s  assets  (critical  networks,  cultural 
properties, etc.) and assess vulnerabilities to various 
climatic hazards, including: surveying lightning rods 
installed  on  buildings;  identifying  weaknesses  of 
underground networks to flooding and high rainfall; 
renewing temperature sensitive components of the 
City’s  telecommunications  networks  and  electricity 
grid.  In  addition,  insurance  data  will  be  used  to 
identify building components (tiles, balconies, pipes, 
conduits,  glass,  limestone,  stained  glass,  etc.)  and 
elements  (shops,  pavements,  roofs)  that  are  most 
vulnerable to specific hazards (storms, air pollution, 
global warming, major flood of the Seine, etc.). The 
City will explore new solutions to monitor the health 
of  buildings  and  infrastructure  using  tools  such  as 
drones or sensors. Knowing these vulnerabilities will 
make it possible to better anticipate reconstruction 
activities,  adapt  regulations  (see  Action  23)  and 
mobilise adequate funding (see Actions 27 and 28). 
A  “Build  Back  Better”  approach  will  be  adopted, 
particularly  for  anticipating  the  reconstruction  of 
major  infrastructure  which  could  be  impacted  by 
a  major  flood  of  the  Seine  (identification  of  the 
most  critical  infrastructure  with  cascading  effects, 
conducting early studies for their reconstruction).

Owner(s)

Office of Energy and Climate 

Main partner(s)

Energy operators and distributors

The existing energy infrastructure was designed to 
be  supplied  by  large  centralised  generators  -  95% 
of the energy consumed in Paris is not produced in 
the city. Moreover, a large share of electrical energy 
is  lost  in  transportation.  Today,  energy  generation 
in the City is increasingly turning to renewable and 
recoverable energy sources, distributed on a smaller 
scale, similar to the first smart-grid project developed 
in  the  neighbourhood  of  Clichy-Batignolles.  This 
project explores a new form of local governance for 
energy  and  a  principle  of  energy  co-responsibility 
for  all  stakeholders.  Similar  initiatives  are  being 
replicated across Paris, such as the introduction of 
biomass in the City’s district heat network and energy 
recovery  from  sewers  and  data  centres,  which  all 
contribute to the objectives of the Paris Climate Air 
and Energy Plan. Although the priority objective of 
the Climate Plan is to halve energy consumption, it 
must be noted that new energy intensive uses such 
as electric mobility risk increasing the overall energy 
consumption significantly. 

In  this  context,  it  is  necessary  to  anticipate  the 
evolution  of  consumption  patterns  and  behaviours 
to  define  energy  mix  scenarios  for  the  decades  to 
come,  to  explore  solutions  (re-balancing  energy 
loads,  self-sufficiency,  cooperatives,  etc.),  to  site 
renewable energy generation locally to the  multiple 
local  resources  (solar,  biomass,  district  heating  /
cooling, hydraulic, recovered energy, etc.) as much 
as  possible,  to  improve  the  resilience  of  energy 
infrastructure  and  to  promote  synergies  between 
networks.  The  City  will  incentivise  and  support 
citizen  projects  to  reappropriate  and  relocate 
energy generation.

Action 13

Improve knowledge of the underground to reduce 
risks related to building collapse and flooding, and 
enhance infrastructure

Changes in groundwater levels are poorly understood 
and  difficult  to  anticipate,  limiting  the  City’s  ability 
to predict the occurrence and potential impacts of 
a major flood.

Implementation

First step(s) 

It  is  necessary  to  map  and  further  explore  Paris’ 
underground  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  its 
make up and vulnerabilities (collapse risk, sinkholes, 
rising  groundwater,  sewers).  Digital  tools  (3D 
mapping, etc.) will be critical for this analysis. 

The  City  of  Paris  launched  a  project  at  the  end  of 
2017  to  map  the  entire  Paris  sewer  system  (2,500 
km), with the objectives of securing and improving 
knowledge.  It  will  also  be  necessary  to  strengthen 
the  underground  piezometer  (devices  used  to 
monitor  groundwater  level)  network;  to  organise 
data  sharing  between  stakeholders  (City  of  Paris, 
ENEDIS, RATP, etc.); to create a map that simulates 
the rise of the Seine and its impacts on groundwater 
levels; and to anticipate ground movements, which 
will be accelerated by periods of drought and other 
climatic  changes.  Outcomes  from  these  activities 
will inform the creation of an insurance fund and a 
resilience bond (see Action 27).

Short-term  -  Recruit  a  Ph.D.  student  to  start  in 
Autumn  2017  to  conduct  the  study;  3D  mapping 
of  underground,  including  sewers;  develop  and 
acquire new measurement tools

Initiate  the  transformation  of  the  ring  road 
(“Périphérique”) and the motorway network

The City proposes to undertake the transformation 
of the ring road (“Périphérique”) and the motorways 
leading to it. Establishing the appropriate territorial 
governance for this transition is thus a priority. The 
Metropolitan  Forum  of  Greater  Paris  (FMGP),  a 
forum  dedicated  to  mobility  and  the  evolution  of 
the motorway network is pursuing this objective. By 
bringing together the various local governments of 
the  Paris  region,  the  FMGP  will  distribute  mobility 
projects  and  priorities  between  all  public,  private 
and  non-profit  stakeholders  within  Paris,  the  Paris 
region and the Greater Paris Metropolis up to 2030 
(development of active mobility, walking and cycling, 
traffic plan, intermodality and integration of Greater 
Paris Express stations, shared vehicles, autonomous 
transport, etc.).

ring road (“Périphérique”) and its connections up to 
the A86 as well as their integration in the metropolitan 
area.  This  project  of  long  term  transformation  will 
be based on the contribution of citizens (see Action 
9)  from  all  municipalities  concerned  through  a 
participatory process. 

Inspiration: Seoul, South Korea

Cheonggyecheon is an urban walkway of nearly 
6km in the centre of the city. This is the name 
of a river that was covered in the 1960s by an 
elevated expressway. In 2005, the city of Seoul 
initiated the demolition of the road infrastructure 
to  unveil  the  stream  that  years  of  neglect  had 
almost  dried  up.  Cheonggyecheon  is  today  a 
public space for relaxation and leisure enjoyed 
by citizens and tourists.

Whilst infrastructure planning and design for multiple 
purposes,  also  known  as  integrated  planning,  is 
poorly  developed  in  France,  it  can  help  achieve 
significant cost, time and space efficiencies. 

The City will develop a resilient road guide covering 
the following themes: 

•  Paving  materials  adapted  to  the  various  risks 
(quiet  pavement,  cooling  pavements  to  reduce 
urban heat island, reversible cycle paths, kinetic 
slabs, draining structures, rainwater underground 
storage, grassed pavers, anti-ramming planters, 
etc.);  surface  typologies  (ground  cover,  grass 
strips, delivery areas); 

•  Connecting  the  underground  (recovery  of  heat 

and cold); 

•  Flexible street furniture; 

•  Accessibility for all and the potential for cultural 
activities  (small  parks,  amphitheatres),  sport 
(sports  routes),  soft  mobility  (100%  cycling 
city by 2050, 75% of roads dedicated to active 
mobility);

•  And integrating reused materials for construction

Transform street lighting to provide multiple urban 
services

Paris, also known as the City of Light, has more than 
200,000 street lights. Although the existing lighting 
infrastructure was designed for a single purpose, it 
could be used to deliver a range of new services and 
benefits, in an efficient and cost-effective way. The 
current energy performance contract for streetlight 
aims to reduce energy consumption by 30% by 2020, 
and the City will continue its efforts beyond this date, 
as part of the future Paris Climate, Air and, Energy, 
Plan. Prior to the renewal of the current contract in 
2021,  the  City  will  initiate  a  process  to  identify  the 
potential  for  using  streetlights  to  deploy  multiple 
benefits  and  services.  An  integrated  approach  will 
be followed so that a diverse range of benefits are 
considered – lighting, climate change mitigation, but 
also solutions for tackling other priority challenges. 
Various urban services can be imagined and tested. 
These  include:  adaptive  grid  risk  management, 
shading,  misting  /  cooling  systems,  access  to 
electricity,  wifi,  environmental  sensors,  cameras 
for  traffic  counting,  electric  vehicle  charging, 
geolocation  of  parking  spaces,  dissemination  of 
daily information or communication in the event of a 
crisis, and services for the homeless, etc.

Implementation

First step(s) 

Short-term  –  Establish  working  groups  on  the 
evolution of street furniture; test smart street lamp 
posts; call for proposals from Urban Lab Paris & Co

Paris Resilience StrategyPillar II - Objective B

Action 17

Adapt public facilities to address priority 
challenges and ensure that they are flexible, 
modular and capable of accommodating multiple 
uses 

Implementation

First step(s) 

Short-term  –  Design  of  the  education  and  sports 
hub at Saint-Vincent-de-Paul

Medium-term  -  Integrate  this  approach  in  the 
development of specifications

Owner(s)

Department of Heritage and Architecture (DPA)

Main partner(s)

In  a  dense  city  facing  challenges  imposed  by 
climate and social changes, it is necessary to better 
allocate occupied spaces and to make constructive 
choices  which  take  into  account  these  changing 
requirements.

The  aim  is  to  integrate  multi-use  criteria  and 
redundance  in  the  specifications  for  the  design  or 
renovation of all public facilities. This requires taking 
into account, early on in the process, the needs and 
constraints  of  users,  standards  and  specificities 
for  each  activity,  and  management  methods.  In 
addition  to  being  redundant,  public  facilities  must 
be  designed  in  line  with  the  City’s  climate  change 
and circular economy objectives. 

The  principle  of  urban  resilience  will  be  applied 
in  the  design  of  the  first  two  buildings:  the 
“multipurpose  facility”  in  the  future  Saint-Vincent-
de-Paul ecological neighbourhood, which will house 
a school, a day care (crèche), spaces for activities in 
the  schoolyard  and  a  gymnasium  in  the  basement. 
The ZAC Bédier Porte d’Ivry development, beyond 
its  primary  functions,  will  include  uses  open  to  the 
neighbourhood. 

The  assessment  of  these  design  and  management 
principles  will  enable  the  development  of  a 
methodology  to  integrate  these  criteria  in  the 
planning  and  design  of  future  facilities  or  their 
renovations.

Action 18

Develop integrated green spaces to respond to 
climate and social challenges

It is proposed to design two resilient parks. In addition 
to  being  energy-sufficient,  the  parks  will  integrate 
territorial  challenges  (rainwater  zoning,  urban  heat 
island,  biodiversity,  inclusion).  Different  solutions 
can  be  tested,  including:  ecological  restoration  of 
polluted soils; involvement of local citizens (especially 
socially  excluded  individuals)  in  the  design  and 
implementation of the project; production of kinetic 
energy  from  playground  activity;  “automatic  and 
intelligent  re-use”  of  all  rainwater  captured  across 
the park; taking into account  the capacity of plants 
for long-term climate change adaptation; preventing 
the  generation  of  allergens  and    the  spread  of 
mosquitoes;  and  creating  spaces  for  breathing 
and  relaxation  (“napping  trees”,  hammocks),  for  
social interaction, for culture and artistic expression 
(amphitheatres, kiosks, pianos, etc.).

Implementation

First step(s) 

Short-term – Select two pilot sites (potential sites 
include: Chapelle Charbon, boulevard de l’hôpital) 
and  hold 
integrated 
workshops.

Action 19

Explore the city from its roots to its canopy and 
assess the potential for rooftop and basement 
development

Paris is the densest city in Europe and lacks available 
land  and  space  for  development.  While  urban 
development  is  increasingly  taking  the  shape  of 
vertical growth, the potential for using underground 
spaces  and  resources  has  not  been  adequately 
explored  yet  and  rooftop  development  has  been 
very limited. 

This  action  proposes  to  explore  the  underground 
and  alternative  uses  for  rooftops,  and  to  evaluate 
the potential urban services they could provide. 

From 2017, efforts will be made to map and explore 
Paris’ underground using digital tools (data science 
competition, 3D mapping, etc.) to identify possible 
uses.  These  could  include:  hybrid  sites,  pools, 
resources, storage, energy generation (e.g. recovery 
of sewer heat), cooling systems connected to wells, 
hydrogeological studies for geothermal energy, etc. 

In a context of growing land scarcity, rooftops could 
provide  additional  space  for  transforming  the  City. 
Therefore, it is proposed to identify and analyse the 
possible uses of rooftops: open and shared spaces 
for  neighbours  to  organise  leisure  events,  cooling, 
urban agriculture, greening, solar energy, rainwater 
storage, etc. 

In  2017  a  workshop  will  be  organised  with 
network  and  service  operators,  licensees,  logistics 
service  providers,  landlords,  restaurants,  cultural 
stakeholders  and  private  individuals  to  explore  the 
culture  of  risk  between  various  stakeholders  and 
identify the potential for underground development. 
This  will  help  define  the  criteria  for  the  upcoming 
2018  competition  “Reinventing  Paris  II”,  and  will 
shape future regulations (see Action 23).

Implementation

First step(s)

Paris Resilience StrategyPillar II - Objective C

Action 20

Mainstream temporary urbanism

Temporary  urbanism  has  many  advantages.  It  can 
raise  the  profile  of  an  area  and  maintain  a  degree 
of  vibrancy  while  waiting  for  redevelopment  to 
begin,  which  can  sometimes  take  years.  It  also 
provides  additional  space  for  a  host  of  activities 
such  as  providing  temporary  shelter  for  refugees, 
vulnerable  and  homeless  people;  working  spaces 
for technology companies and resources centres; or 
venues for cultural events with a high local impact, 
urban agriculture, etc. 

The strategy proposes to systematically use vacant 
and idle spaces to renew the use of the urban space 
and  respond  to  different  needs.  More  specifically, 
this  action  will  look  at  ways  of  connecting  land 
owners  and  developers  with  project  owners, 
potential  occupiers,  or  temporary  users  so  as  to 
promote solutions that support urban resilience. The 
objective  should  be  that  all  urban  projects  follow 
this  principle  which  will  be  set  out  in  a  charter  of 
temporary / transitional occupation. 

The  redevelopment  of  Saint-Vincent-de-Paul  and 

other  initiatives  currently  underway,  particularly  at 
the  SNCF  sites,  attest  to  the  value  of  temporary 
occupation.  The  objective  is  to  measure  the  short-
term  impact  of  these  initiatives  on  the  territory,  to 
evaluate  the  economic  models  of  the  stakeholders 
involved, and to assess possible changes in the legal 
framework of occupation.

Implementation

First step(s) 

Short-term  –  Develop  a  charter  of  temporary 
/  transitional  occupation;  create  a  platform  to 
connect project owners with developers / managers 
/ owners of urban spaces in development.

Develop the first resilient and climate-sensitive 
neighbourhood at Saint-Vincent-de-Paul

sustainable,  and 

The  former  Saint-Vincent-de-Paul  hospital  sits 
on  a  3.4-hectare  site,  in  the  north  of  the  14th 
arrondissement  (district).  It  is  part  of  a  new  “eco-
district”  development  designed  to  be  simple, 
unadorned, 
innovative.  The 
partnership  known  as 
“Les  Grands  Voisins” 
comprises three organisations and was established 
to clear the hospital site and explore opportunities 
for occupying and using the site during its vacancy 
period.  They  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the 
premises,  guiding  temporary  users  and  opening 
the  site  to  the  public.  Today,  nearly  2,000  people 
live  and  work  there.  The  site  includes  shelter  for 
vulnerable  people  as  well  as  working  spaces  for 
cultural associations and social enterprises. It makes 
“Les  Grands  Voisins”  a  laboratory  for  temporary 
urbanism (see Action 20) and for urban resilience.

redundant  facilities  delivering  urban  services  and 
social cohesion, etc).

Action 22

Design an exemplary resilient neighbourhood at 
Bercy-Charenton 

in  the  structuring  of  the 
This  strategic  area 
metropolitan area is located at the entrance of Paris 
(12th arrondissement or district), on the banks of the 
Seine  and  at  the  intersection  of  major  railway  and 
road  infrastructures.  The  70-hectare  site,  partially 
located  in  a  flood  zone,  is  one  of  the  last  major 
brownfield  redevelopment  areas  in  the  City  and 
offers a significant opportunity for transforming this 
district into an exemplary resilient neighbourhood. 

The  aim  is  to  integrate  resilience  criteria  from 
the  design  stage  of  the  project  and  throughout 
its  development  process.  Analytical  tools  and 
partners  will  be  mobilised  to  ensure  that  risks  and 
resilience solutions are taken into account in all the 
components of the project: landscape, construction, 
public  services  and  networks,  implementation  of 
the Rain Plan, energy supply (including geothermal 
energy), solidarity within the wider area, specific link 
to the Seine, resilience to floods, etc. 

Starting  in  2017,  the  resilience  and  adaptation 
indicators  developed  within  the  framework  of 
the  European  project  “RESIN”    will  be  integrated. 
Starting  in  2018,  an  international  call  for  ideas  will 

be launched to define the resilience requirements to 
incorporate in the architectural designs. The specific 
issue  of  high-rise  buildings  and  their  capacity  to 
integrate  resilience  criteria  will  be  of  particular 
interest,  including:  technical,  natural  and  social 
solutions  to  floods,  climate-related  challenges,  and 
air pollution.

Some municipal, national or international regulations 
must  evolve  for  Paris  to  become  more  resilient. 
For  example,  the  “inorganic  character”  of  urban 
planning in Paris, as enshrined in urban and heritage 
regulations,  will  have  to  evolve  to  make  the  City 
more responsive to the effects of climate change.

to  mainstream 

A first step would be to identify the current regulatory 
obstacles 
in  urban 
development  and  construction,  and  to  introduce 
new  binding  measures  or  incentives,  particularly  in 
strategic  urban  planning  requirements  at  the  city 
and  metropolitan  scales.  They  will  have  to  allow  / 
encourage / constrain a flexible, adaptable or even 
reversible  programming,  from  the  design  stage, 
thereby  enabling  buildings  to  evolve  according 
to  different  uses  during  their  lifetime  (housing, 
household  and  demographic  changes,  technical 
equipment, commercial premises, use of roofs, etc.). 

The  opportunity  for  revising  the  PPRI,  designed  to 
limit  the  risks  associated  with  a  major  flood,  must 
be  considered  so  as  to  integrate  new  construction 
processes.  The  resilient  road  guide  (see  Action  15) 
will  inform  practitioners  on  the  role  of  materials 
for  managing  social,  climatic  and  health  risks.  A 
summary of the sustainable development objectives 
of urban projects and an environmental guide of the 
PLU  providing  case  studies  and  recommendations 
will be produced. Housing solutions will be explored 
including  redundance,  modularity,  services  and 
design that facilitate wellbeing and limit the isolation 
of  individuals,  taking  into  account  the  evolution  of 
migratory flows, an aging population and the desire 
to stay longer at home. The City of Paris will lobby 
real estate operators and develop incentives.

Paris Resilience Strategy

Focus

Using road infrastructure as an asset 
for advancing resilience

The  Resilience  Strategy  takes  into  account 
the  transformation  of  road  infrastructure  in  a 
cross-cutting way: the occupation of public spaces 
by  neighbours,  tactical  urban  planning  and  the 
implementation  of  solutions  by  citizens  (pillar  I). 
It  foresees  the  transformation  of  the  ring  road 
(“Périphérique”)  and  the  reappropriation  of  the 
road  network  to  develop  multiple  uses  (pillar  II). 
Finally, it integrates the systemic dimension of this 
issue through territorial cooperation, particularly on 
the  development  of  coworking  and  employment 
exchanges at the regional scale (pillar III). 

PARIS

The  City  of  Paris  is  committed  to 
reducing the impact of road traffic and 
improving mobility solutions 

To  address  air  pollution,  the  City  is  currently 
implementing  a  plan  to  encourage  Parisians  to 
adopt  sustainable  solutions.  Key  measures  include: 
financial incentives for purchasing electric vehicles, 
subsidies for purchasing electric bicycles and cycle 
shelter  grants,  development  of  public  transport, 
etc.  In  parallel,  the  City  is  taking  steps  towards 
reallocating public space in favour of active mobility 
through  the  following  measures  and  initiatives: 
vehicle  restricted  area,  Limited  Traffic  Zone,  “Paris 
Respire”  (“Paris  Breathes”)  neighbourhood,  Paris 
pedestrian strategy, Cycle plan, etc.

AECOM studies the multiple benefits of 
reducing road traffic

In the spring of 2017, AECOM, a Strategy Partner of 
100RC,  conducted  a  study  on  the  multiple  benefits 
from    reduced  road  traffic  in  Paris.  These  include: 
reduction in accident rates; reduction in health costs 
(¤350-400 million per year); reduction in ecosystem 
and  building  costs;  opportunities  for  urban  renewal; 
freeing-up  valuable  urban  space  for  other  uses; 
reduction in obesity through the promotion of active 
transport  modes;  improving  quality  of  life;  lower 
levels  of  traffic  congestion  which  in  turn  unlocks 
productivity gains, improves deliveries and enhances 
territorial  attractiveness.  According  to  the  simple 
assumptions made in this study, the external costs of 
road traffic are estimated at between ¤2.9 and ¤4.5 
billion  per  year  in  Paris  and  between  ¤14  and  ¤17.8 
billion in the Île-de-France region.

Air quality is a resilience issue

Air pollution has been identified as one of the priority 
challenges for Paris and the Paris metropolitan area. 
In  June  2016,  the  city’s  Chief  Resilience  Officer 
organised a World Summit of Cities and Metropolises 
in  Paris  which  resulted  in  the  creation  of  a  Global 
Urban  Air  Pollution  Observatory  (GUAPO).  The 
objective  is  to  share  knowledge  on  air  pollution 
and  its  health  impact,  as  well  as  monitor  progress 
achieved in reducing urban pollution in metropolitan 
areas.

Paris Resilience Strategy

A city in transition that 
mobilises collective 
intelligence, adapts its 
operations, and cooperates 
with its surrounding 
territories

The  resilient  approach  is  an  effective  solution  to 
turn  transitions  (such  as  ecological,  energetic, 
economic  or  digital  transitions)  into  opportunities 
for  developing  and  improving  living  standards. 
Several approaches are proposed to organise these 
transitions  and  adapt  public  policies  as  well  as 
territorial governance to tomorrow’s challenges.
Mobilise. Mobilising and training of a wide range 
of  stakeholders,  producing  additional  spatial  data 
of the territory, its vulnerabilities and the risks that 
threaten it, are some of the drivers that will enable 
a  better  allocation  of  resources  and  ensure  the 
implementation of shared and sustainable solutions.
Organise.  The  city  administration  must 
constantly  adapt  its  operations  to  ensure  the 
continuity of its activities in all circumstances, and to 
make sure that, each and every day, its investments, 
staff and policies contribute to the resilience of the 
territory.
Collaborate.  The  responses  to  most  of  the 
issues identified operate at a scale wider than that 
of the city’s administration boundaries. As a result, 
improved  territorial  governance  is  needed.  The 
creation  of  the  Greater  Paris  Metropolis  and  the 
establishment of new links with rural municipalities 
are  some  of  the  key  levers  to  transform  the 
interdependencies 
into 
opportunities.  These  places  that  form  a  system, 
irrespective of administrative borders, and the urban 
metabolism,  its  flows,  inputs,  waste,  shared  assets, 
and economic links, must all be re-invented.

territories 

between 

The  metropolitan  approach  as  a  resilience 
driver:  From  the  start  of  the  strategy 
development,  a  key  point  emerged:  none  of 
the  identified  stresses  and  shocks  could  only 
be  addressed  at  the  city  scale.  Responses 
must be formulated at the metropolitan level. 
Resilience  is  also  a  central  theme  of  the  first 
Innovation  Agreement  between  the  Greater 
Paris Metropolis and the State, and at the core 
of the metropolis’ strategic competencies (i.e. 
planning, shelter and housing, management of 
aquatic  environments  and  flood  prevention). 
100RC commissioned students from Sciences 
Po to explore this topic with cities and territories 
of the metropolis and other cities around the 
world.  This  resulted  in  recommendations  for 
improving  dialogue  and  co-operation,  pilot 
projects  to  demonstrate  proof  of  concept, 
ensuring  its  visibility  in  public  spaces  and  its 
mainstreaming.

Action 24

Create an open-source, multi-target resource, 
research and training centre for resilience

Implementation

First step(s)

Short-term  –    Set  up  a  scientific  interest  group; 
Submit  “I-Site”  application  to  the  Investments  for 
the  Future  Programme  (PIA);  establish  an  online 
resource platform

Medium-term – Establish the research, training and 
resource centre

Owner(s)

Chief Resilience Officer (CRO)

Main partner(s)

Sustainable City Institute (IVD)

This research, training and resource centre will build 
on  contributions  from  the  Scientific  Interest  Group 
working  on  the  resilience  of  the  territory,  and  /  or 
on  the  “resilient  city”  application  submitted  by  the 
Ecole des Ponts in partnership with the City of Paris 
and some 20 other organisations, in response to the 
“I-Sites” call for projects on future cities. 

The  objectives  of  the  centre  include  developing 
research programmes around this strategy and urban 
resilience, supporting the design of dedicated training 
courses, developing MOOC (online training open to 
all)  on  resilience-related  issues.  It  will  support  the 
creation of specialised Master courses and training 
courses for staff members of local authorities as well 
as  private  sector  and  not-for-profit  organisations. 
These courses will be delivered as part of the Paris 
arrondissements’ (district) Initiative and Consultation 
Committees and prepared in collaboration with the 
local municipalities. Programmes will be designed in 
partnership with various stakeholders (corporations, 
local  businesses,  hotel  industry,  pharmacists,  etc.) 
and tailored to their specific challenges). 

Among  the  overarching  principles,  the  creation 
of  “commons”  will  be  proposed  to  promote  the 
creativity  and  the  up-skilling  of  all.  This  centre  will 
rely on existing bodies at all levels within the City of 
Paris, including: The Smart City partners committee, 
the  Parisian  Climate  Agency,  and  leaders  of  the 
sustainable Paris agenda. It will also train senior City 
staff on risks and resilience (see Action 29).

Paris Resilience StrategyPillar III - Objective A

Action 25

Establish an observatory to understand how 
different risks impact public health and study socio-
environmental vulnerabilities of the territory

While  vegetation  and  water  in  cities  are  effective 
urban  heat  island  mitigators,  the  health  risks  that 
may  arise  if  they  are  not  adequately  anticipated 
(allergies,  mosquitos  and  the  pandemics  they  may 
carry, etc.) must be considered. 

In  addition,  as  social  and  territorial  vulnerabilities 
can  increase  health  vulnerabilities,  there  is  a  need 
to  better  understand  these  interdependencies.  It  is 
proposed to bring together experts from within the 
City  of  Paris  and  from  the  territory  to  assess  and 
formulate  recommendations  on  how  to  address 
the challenges of the 21st century for better health 
and wellbeing in the city using a resilience, disaster 
preparedness and climate adaptation lens. 

This expert hub will study the interactions between 
different  themes 
including  benefits,  risks  and 
adaptation  of  green  solutions  in  the  city  (adapting 
plant  species,  water  and  biodiversity  to  climate 
changes,  allergenic  plants,  hydrometeorology);  the 
health  impacts  of  climate  change  and  air  pollution 
(asthma,  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  diseases, 
allergies, etc.); risks of major health shocks (nuclear 
accident, epidemic),  solutions for combating vector-
borne diseases through urban planning (saturnism); 
the study of individual strategies to adapt to climate 
change  (behaviours,  choices,  perceptions);  health 
inequalities; and socio-environmental vulnerabilities.

The  development  of  disruptive  technologies,  such 
as  robotics,  artificial  intelligence,  the  massive  and 
exponential  development  of  personal  data,  etc.,  call 
for  the  increased  adaptation  of  public  authorities  to 
this  rapid  change  and  complex  issues.  For  Paris,  the 
main challenge is to seize this opportunity, to mobilise 
innovation  leaders  to  build  shared  assets,  while 
ensuring  that  these  technologies  meet  the  needs 
of  citizens  and  safeguard  public  service  quality  and 
resources.

integrated 

We  will  prepare  a  dynamic  and  participatory  risk 
mapping,  drawing  on  contributions  from  volunteers 
and  the  support  of  “ethical  hackers”  associations. 
This  mapping  will  be  carried  out  with  data  provided 
by citizens themselves and will allow the information 
produced  to  be 
in  risk  prevention 
systems and emergency management. The idea is to 
encourage citizens to acquire sensors and to develop 
data  collection  and  analysis  tools.  This  mapping  will 
also  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  emergency 
communication 
technologies.  We 
propose  to  train  members  of  community  solidarity 
networks 
in  open  source  mapping  along  with 
organising  an  event  on  collaborative  mapping  as  an 
urban development and resilience tool. 

through  new 

In  January  2018,  a  Resilience  Innovation  Fellowship 
will  bring  together  innovation  leaders  to  develop 
responses to the challenges identified in this strategy 
(underground  mapping,  increasing  risk  awareness  
through  gamification,  matching  supply  and  demand 
for volunteers). Finally, this mapping will be designed 
and will be open data, ensuring reliability, free access 
and  providing  guarantees  for  the  ethical  use  of  the 
data produced.

Paris Resilience StrategyPillar III - Objective A

Action 27

Develop new finance mechanisms for resilience 
solutions in Paris: from sustainability bonds to 
resilience bonds

We aim to develop an innovative strategy to finance 
resilience  actions,  which  will  include  local  carbon 
offsetting  funds,  crowdfunding,  social  financing, 
micro-grants, tax incentives, etc. 

As  a  first  step,  a  Sustainability  Bond  will  be  issued 
in 2017. Sustainability bonds provide an opportunity 
to  diversify  not  only  the  type  but  also  the  quality 
of  investors.  Such  bonds  will  also  need  to  meet 
sustainable  development  objectives.  In  November 
2015, the City of Paris issued a Climate Bond of ²¤300 
million to fund climate-compatible projects aligned 
with the objectives of the Climate-Air-Energy Plan. 
The benefits of this type of bond reside as much in 
the  financing  of  projects  with  specific  objectives, 
as  in  their  management  approach  (improvement 
of  procedures,  third  party  assessments  of  projects 
progress  and  social  /  environmental  responsibility 
governance).  The  Sustainability  Bond  will  follow 
a  similar  approach.  Its  objective  will  be  even 
more  forward-looking  and  will  include  a  resilience 
component  specifically  targeting  extreme  climate 
events. We aim to mobilise expertise and financing 
from  resilience  specialists  (finance  and  banking 
stakeholders, insurers and / or reinsurers, third party 

auditors,  etc.)  to  ensure  that  the  projects  financed 
have  clear  resilience  benefits.  Outcomes  from  the 
audit  carried  out  by  the  Resilience  Team  will  be 
presented  to  investors  at  a  conference  to  explore 
areas of opportunity. 

In  the  medium-term,  we  will  propose  the  creation 
of a Resilience Bond focused on flood prevention / 
reconstruction.

Berkeley Funds Resilience and 
Announces Infrastructure Project List

A  $100M  infrastructure  bond,  known  as  Measure  T1,  was 
initiated  as  part  of  the  city’s  resilience  building  efforts. 
Berkeley  published  a  list  of  more  than  30  infrastructure 
projects eligible for funding. For inclusion on the list, every 
project  had  to  meet  certain  safety,  financial,  social,  and 
environmental  criteria  laid  out  in  the  Resilience  Strategy. 
Furthermore, it had to demonstrate how it provided multiple 
benefits to the community. The projects included: bioswales, 
bicycle infrastructure, shelter centres, and repairs to the pier.

Action 28

Shift municipal investments, concession treaties, public 
service delegations and public procurement towards 
resilience by using new indicators

Infrastructure  investments,  concessions  and  public 
service  delegation  agreements,  as  well  as  the 
City’s procurement policy, constitute key levers for 
resilience. While the City of Paris is endowed with a 
10 billion euros capital budget for the entire mandate, 
every  euro  that  is  spent  can  and  must  contribute 
towards climate resilience and the strengthening of 
social cohesion.

This  action  aims  to  create  and  mobilise  resilience 
indicators  (biodiversity,  social  inclusion,  adaptation 
to climate change - and the cost of non-adaptation, 
etc.)  to  prioritise  investment  and  procurement 
choices, and to elaborate compulsory specification 
of  concession  and  public  service  delegation 
agreements. 

for 
We  will  also  explore  developing  a  tool 
monitoring  the  evolution  of  municipal  spending 
to  enable  measurement  of  the  City’s  commitment 
to  dedicate  10%  of  its  capital  expenditure  to 
resilience  building.  Cost  and  benefit  analysis  will 
be  incorporated  throughout  the  decision-making 
process. The resilience indicators will help adapt the 
City’s public procurement plan and assess the need 
for  anticipating  the  renewal  of  certain  concession 
agreements  and  delegations  of  public  services  to 

integrate the latest technological developments and 
knowledge. To this end, the City’s budget staff will 
be trained to evaluate projects against these cross-
cutting indicators, and investment programmes will 
be defined using this framework.

Implementation

First step(s)

Short-term – Select a consultant or commission a 
100RC partner, benchmark and develop a tool for 
tracking  resilience-related  expenditure;  develop 
new  indicators;  identify  opportunities  to  renew 
concessions or service provider contracts.

Vejle - Strategic Preventative Investments: Applying resilience 
learning from other sectors to public healthcare and wellbeing    

Vejle has identified several neighbourhoods, which will serve 
as  laboratories  for  testing  preventative  health  solutions 
along  with  indicators  developed  for  assessing  investment 
projects.  The  initiative  places  great  emphasis  on  parental 
and  family  relations,  and  more  broadly  on  the  connection 
between  resilient  neighbourhoods  and  public  health.  With 
this intervention, the city aims to improve the quality of life, 
break  cycles  of  “negative  social  heritage”  and  ensure  that 
good investments are made at the right time.

Action 29

Ensure   continuity of municipal activity in the event of an 
emergency

The  development  and  /  or  revision  of  the  Business 
Continuity  Plans  must  be  pursued,  and  the  City’s 
entire  management  staff  mobilised  and  working 
towards achieving this goal. An on-call reserve, made 
up of about 100 retired employees from the City of 
Paris, is already involved in programmes introduced 
during previous heatwaves.

We  propose  to  finalize  100%  of  the  Business 
Continuity  Plans  by  the  end  of  2018.  To  this  end, 
support  will  be  provided  to  all  City  Departments 
with a special emphasis placed on vulnerable people 
who are typically more exposed to risks. We will also 
train municipal supervisors on risk and resilience and 
ensure  that  such  training  is  integrated  in  new  staff 
onboarding.  The  aim  is  also  to  extend  the  on-call 
reserve  that  is  currently  solely  made  up  of  retired 
staff,  to  include  voluntary  workers.  The  end  goal  is 
to  train  100%  of  municipal  employees  on  risk  and 
crisis  management.  The  training  will  be  adapted  to 
the  identified  risks  and  tailored  to  each  profession. 
Municipal employees working in the public space will 
receive training adapted to their profession and their 

role.  These  training  programmes  will  be  renewed 
to  refresh  memories,  methods  and  tools.  Finally, 
we will support the departments in setting up crisis 
management  and  resilience  mechanisms,  similar 
to  ongoing  experiences  within  the  Department  of 
Health,  Family  and  Social  Services  as  well  as  the 
Social Action Centre of the City of Paris. Within these 
two  public  agencies,  pilot  committees  focusing  on 
resilience have been set up to guarantee the regular 
monitoring  of  these  issues  and  integration  of  these 
challenges at every level.

Paris  in  action:  internal  innovation  within 
the City of Paris
The  resilience  of  the  administration  also  depends 
on  the  ability  to  innovate  and  adapt.  The  “Transfo” 
programme, carried out with the 27th region, provides 
training  for  municipal  employees  on  new  and  user-
centric  approaches  to  public  policy  design.    A  “City 
Start-Up” entrepreneurship scheme is also underway. 

In  the  long-term,  the  objective  is  to  establish  an 
innovation laboratory within the City, focusing on the 
design of citizen-centric public policies. This laboratory 
will also help to build and spread a culture of public 
service innovation within the city administration.

for  applications  and 

convergence, 

For  each  new  infrastructure,  an  assessment  of 
energy  and  heat  consumption  will  be  carried  out 
and  recommendations  will  be  formulated  on:  heat 
recovery  systems,  transformation  of  heating  into 
cooling,  use  of  carbon  neutral  energy  sources  for 
these  developments,  carbon  offsetting,  or  even  an

Action 31

Define and sign a territorial cooperation pact 
with peri-urban and rural municipalities, based on 
common interests and shared actions 

Whether  it  is  for  food  supply,  employment,  flood 
risk  prevention  at  the  watershed  level  or  even  the 
limitation  of  commuting  journeys  through  remote  / 
home working, Paris depends on its surrounding rural 
areas, and vice versa.

The action therefore proposes to materialise common 
interests and to initiate actions through an agreement 
between the City of Paris, the Greater Paris Metropolis 
and  the  Association  of  Rural  Mayors  of  France,  to 
promote  territorial  cooperation  for  resilience.  The 
objective  is  to  develop  new  interactions  between 
urban and rural areas, and to formalise the common 
interests between Paris, the Greater Paris Metropolis   
and rural territories. 

The partners will lead pilot projects in various areas 
including:  reduction  of  commutes  to  /  from  Paris 
by  creating  coworking  centres  in  the  periphery  of 
the capital and beyond (7% of municipal employees 
live  outside  the  Ile-de-France  region),  conservation 
of water resources in cooperation with towns in the 
catchment  area,  such  as  the  programme  that  the 
Eau de Paris (Paris Water Authority) is leading in this 
field,  sharing  technical  expertise  from  Paris  to  rural 
areas  and  towns  in  transition,  sustainable  food  and 
supply, circular economy and recycling of materials, 
investment  in  the  production  of  renewable  energy 

sources and carbon sink projects beyond city limits 
or outside Paris, school twinnings between Paris and 
rural towns, etc. Energy solidarity, jobs and resource 
relocation  and  the  vitality  of  the  territories  are  just 
some  of  the  key  advantages  of  such  a  cooperation 
pact.  The  pact  will  be  developed  initially  through 
workshops with possible action plans then presented 
to key partners.

Action 32

Support the watershed’s climate change adaptation 
programme to preserve water resources and 
limit the scale of floods in partnership with rural 
municipalities

The  challenges  of  limiting  the  risk  of  flooding, 
preventing  low  flows  and  improving  the  quality  of 
the Seine’s water call for a common and integrated 
approach  and 
response.  Such  action  must 
contribute towards the following goals:  ensuring the 
permeability of soils and renaturation where possible 
of  the  riverbed  of  the  Seine  and  its  tributaries, 
drastic limitation of polluting discharges in the rivers 
through  the  creation  of  new  positive  partnerships 
with towns, farmers and industries of the watershed. 
To  address  these  challenges,  the  Seine  Normandie 
Basin Committee has approved an adaptation plan 
for  climate  change,  of  which  the  City  of  Paris  and 
Paris Water Authority are partners.

Within  the  framework  of  the  100RC  programme,  a 
study  has  already  been  carried  out  by  a  Platform 
Partner  on  the  potential  for  the  expansion  of  the 
flood  zone  and  the  redevelopment  of  biodiversity 
and  wetlands,  which  can  play  an  important  role 
for  both  flood  and  low-water  prevention  and 
decontamination.  An  assessment  of  the  socio-
economic and environmental impacts resulting from 
low-water level and severe droughts on the Seine’s 
upstream  watershed  will  also  be  carried  out  by 
EPTB Seine Great Lacs (Public Territorial Institute of 
the  Seine  Basin).  Several  doctoral  theses  on  flood 
risks will also be reviewed by the City of Paris or by 
its partners. 

The  City  of  Paris  will  pursue  partnerships  with 
neighbouring territories. In accordance with its plan 
for the protection of water resources, Eau de Paris 

(Paris  Water  Authority)  will  continue  to  purchase 
agricultural  land  and  to  support  farmers  located  in 
the areas supplying safe drinking water to develop 
sustainable  agricultural  practices.  Other  initiatives 
include:  developing  freight  transportation  on  the 
River  Seine  and  canals,  encouraging  large  scale 
catering companies to buy from local farmers in the 
Paris basin.

Implementation

First step(s)

Short-term  –  Identify  six  reference  territories 
representing  the  different  typologies  of  the 
watershed; mobilise the mapping developed within 
the  framework  of  the  Resilience  Strategy  to  set 
up  pilot  projects  with  farmers,  manufacturers  or 
communes of the voluntary watershed.

Paris Resilience StrategyMelbourne’s “metropolitan forest” strategy

Across Melbourne, urban greening and revegetation 
projects  are  being  undertaken  by  local  councils, 
water authorities, community groups, and regional 
agencies  and  organisations.    By  undertaking  a 
coordinated  metropolitan  strategy,  Melbourne 
will  enable  stakeholders,  and  others  wanting  to 
deliver  urban  greening  projects  in  the  future,  to 
understand  how  their  efforts  can  best  contribute 
to improving ecosystem health and services such 
as urban cooling and flood mitigation.

Action 33

Adopt a sustainable food strategy for the territory

8  million  meals  are  eaten 
in  Paris  everyday. 
Strengthening  the  independence,  autonomy  and 
resilience of the food system is a priority for the years 
to come. This could be achieved by diversifying and 
bringing  supply  chains  ‘closer  to  home’,  especially 
through new partnerships with rural territories. 

To guarantee supply, it is also necessary to improve 
information  sharing  between  crisis  management 
services for communities and operators, distributors 
and  the  State  on  stocks,  sectors,  and  impacts 
related to transport. It is estimated that food supply 
and  consumption  in  France  accounts  for  36% 
of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  mainly  due  to  the 
territories’ dependence on long supply routes. Thus, 
Paris  has  committed  to  developing  a  sustainable 
food strategy for the territory, which will help achieve 
the goal of a sustainable, inclusive and resilient food 
system that is safe and diversified for all.

This strategy, currently under development, involves 
food  stakeholders  at  every 
level:  distributors, 
processors,  retailers,  farmers,  etc.  It  presents  a 
specific  partnership  plan  for  guaranteeing  food 
supply  in  the  event  of  a  major  flood.  This  scheme 
could be replicated for other types of emergencies. 
It  will  integrate  the  ambition  to  consolidate  urban 
and  local  agriculture  and  to  explore  new  ways  of 
producing in urban areas. This strategy will be a key 
element in the overall work with rural municipalities 
(see Action 31), which is another tangible opportunity 
to create links between urban and rural areas.

Implementation

First step(s)

Paris  in  action:  the  “Parisculteurs” 
(Parisian farmers)
The City of Paris and its 71 partners, signatories 
of  the  “100  hectares  objective”  Charter  are 
mobilising  to  increase  the  green  coverage 
of  100  hectares  of  buildings  by  2020  in  the 
capital,  a  third  of  which  is  devoted  to  urban 
agriculture. In this context, numerous innovative 
techniques  for  food  production  in  urban 
areas  are  proposed  (aeroponics,  aquaponics, 
hydroponics, mushroom cultivation, “lasagna” 
gardening,  permaculture,  etc.),  particularly 
through  the  “Parisculteurs”  call  for  projects, 
which  makes  new  land  available  to  urban 
farmers.

Action 34

Carry out a multi-stakeholder study to examine 
the potential for creating coworking centres and 
facilitate job swapping at the metropolitan scale

Technological  tools  offer  new  solutions,  making 
it  possible  to  move  less  and  reduce  commuting-
related emissions. A study carried out as part of the 
Paris  administration  Commuter  Plan  showed  that 
10,000  of  the  50,000  employees  in  the  regional 
government could potentially work remotely part of 
the week.

The objective is to reduce the number of commuting 
trips by 30% at the scale of the conurbation by 2030 
through remote working and coworking. This in turn 
will  promote  territorial  solidarity  by  reducing  the 
strain  on  workers  in  Ile-de-France  who  are  forced 
into  long  commutes  and  by  participating  in  the 
revitalisation  of  local  economies  throughout  the 
region. A study will be launched in 2018 in conjunction 
with large companies and administrations to identify 
and  describe  coworking  space  needs,  and  the 
impacts of promoting remote work on road traffic, 
quality of life and health and the economy.

Action 35

Develop circular economy, local manufacturing and 
non-monetary trading

In  Paris,  many  activities  are  being  developed  to 
improve  the  management  of  local  resources  and 
to define a new urban metabolism. These activities 
challenge the boundaries and scales of the existing 
territories. Resource centres, recycling activities, non-
monetary trade, “repair cafes”, micro-methanisation, 
waste sorting, urban agriculture, local manufacturing 
(fablabs) are all drivers for social inclusion. They help 
lead  to  projects  for  social  integration,  agricultural 
training,  maintenance  of  community  spaces,  and 
creating biodiversity-related jobs.

The  aim  is  to  implement  the  roadmap  on  circular 
economy  and  to  develop  local  manufacturing, 
which  brings  more  autonomy,  sobriety,  integration 
through local job creation (entrepreneurs, designers, 
artists,  handymen,  hackers)  and  ultimately  builds 
resilience.  Identifying  places  for  innovation,  at  the 
neighbourhood level, will enable the mobilisation of 
innovation stakeholders and other key stakeholders 
within “living labs” - local experimentation of smart 

solutions: Deux Rives (Two River Banks), Innovation 
Territories,  etc.  Finally,  the  City  of  Paris  will  work 
with  key  leaders  of  the  Social  and  Solidarity 
Economy  (SSE)  to  promote  lending,  bartering  and 
non-monetary exchanges. 

Many  initiatives  are  being  developed  to  lend  and 
exchange  goods  and  services,  referred  to  as 
“collaborative  consumption”  by  sociologists  and 
economists.  The  practice  of  bartering  invites  us  to 
rethink how we consume and connect with others: 
less  unnecessary  purchases,  waste,  pollution,  more 
mutual  help,  solidarity,  alternative  ways...  Beyond 
these dimensions, barter is a lever for social inclusion, 
facilitating access to means of exchange with other 
citizens. It may also constitute, if its practice is well 
developed,  a  protection  against  the  effects  of  a 
monetary, economic or financial crisis.

Paris Resilience Strategy

Focus

The Seine, agent of resilience

The Resilience Strategy addresses the chal-
lenges associated with the River Seine in a cross-cut-
ting  and  comprehensive  way:  it  proposes  to  raise 
awareness about flood risks, to mobilise them within 
the framework of community solidarity networks, in 
particular in the event of a flood (pillar I); to antic-
ipate  and  adapt  the  impacts  of  shocks  and  stress-
es related to the river on infrastructure (pillar II); to 
improve the integration of flood risk within the City 
administration; to guide partners involved in the cli-
mate change adaptation of the watershed, to renew 
and strengthen cooperation with municipalities and 
farmers upstream (pillar III), etc.

the potential to recreate the original riverbed of the 
Seine, with the threefold objective of mitigating the 
effects of drought and low flows, limiting floods, and 
improving the water quality.

Paris Resilience StrategyFocus: The Seine, agent of resilience

The  City  is  developing  with  the  river  
The pedestrianisation of the road running along the 
right bank of the River Seine, the call for projects on 
“Reinventing the Seine”, the plan to make the Seine 
swimmable for the 2024 Olympic Games, the future 
Rain and Biodiversity Plan, are all interventions that 
aim to restore the City’s relationship with its river and 
its environment, and to adapt it to climate change. 
At the same time, the City of Paris is continuing its 
efforts  to  manage  risks  from  flooding.  Beyond  the 
new infrastructure and the permanent monitoring of 
water levels, the City is engaging with stakeholders 
and participating in the programme of actions and 
prevention of floods (PAPI) of the Seine and Marne 
Francilienne.  In  2016,  the  European  SEQUANA 
exercise  brought  together  all  stakeholders  to 
experience a flood simulation, for the first time.

The Seine resilience challenge

The  Seine  is  an  infinite  resource  for  Paris  and  its 
metropolitan area, but also represents three priority 
challenges: drought and risks related to low water, 
poor  water  quality,  and  flood  management.  For 
the  latter,  it  is  necessary  to  anticipate  the  impacts 
of a major flooding of the Seine and to identify the 
systems, infrastructure and services to be rebuilt if 
such an event were to occur. The City of Paris has 
defined technical, social and governance challenges 
to  prepare  for  this  reconstruction  by  bringing 
together  network  operators,  state  services,  urban 
planners and architects.

Conclusion

Embedding  resilience  in  behaviours  and  norms 
is  a  challenge  for  the  future.  The  City  of  Paris  will 
pursue the efforts initiated as part of the partnership 
with  the  100  Resilient  Cities  network,  to  enhance 
resilience at its scale.

A  single  agenda  now  guides  cross-cutting  policies 
for  a  sustainable,  connected,  inclusive,  supportive 
and  resilient  city  that  meets  the  challenges  of  the 
21st  century.  Paris  is  committed  to  dedicating  10% 
of  its  annual  budget  towards  resilience-building 
activities  and  investments.  The  first  step  has  been 
accomplished.  This  new  approach  will  enable  the 
administration  to  innovate  and  adapt  professional 
practices to the needs of the territory. Implementing 
this  strategy  will  entail  regular  meetings  with 
partners, citizens and economic leaders.

Paris  will  continue  its  international  exchanges 
with  100  Resilient  Cities  and  will  lead  networks  of 
cities  that  share  similar  resilience  challenges:  cities 
hosting  refugees  and  migrants,  confronting  terror 
threats,  and  fighting  the  local  impacts  of  climate 
change  and  air  pollution.  Through  this  continued 
knowledge  exchange,  Paris  hopes  to  work  with 
other  like-minded  cities  on  co-designing  resilient 
urban solutions.

The  resilient  approach  will  also  capture  the  2024 
Olympic  and  Paralympic  Games  in  Paris  as  an 
opportunity  for  the  development  of  education 
through  sports,  weaving  a  material  and  symbolic 
community  to  renew  processes  and  to  build  on 
solidarity  between  Paris  and  its  suburbs,  thereby 
creating a resilient metropolitan area.

The holistic and integrated approach to resilience 
is  a  new  way  of  policy-making.  Far  from  being  a 
rigid planning document prescribing actions for the 
coming decades, this strategy proposes a path and 
identifies  first  steps  that  must  be  re-examined  to 
constantly learn, innovate, recover and prepare for 
the  risks  that  now  determine  human  relations  and 
links between societies and their environment.

“The  Haussmann  Revolution”  of 
the  Second 
Empire  propelled  Paris  into  a  completely  new  era 
through  the  lasting  changes  it  made  in  various 
areas:  urbanism,  transport,  mobility,  infrastructure, 
networks,  equipment,  parks,  street  furniture,  etc. 
It  especially  sought  to  address  major  stresses, 
such  as  congestion  and  squalor,  and  was,  in  part, 
considered  an  effective,  sustainable,  “integrated 
and  holistic”  vision.  However  it  did  not  adequately 
consider the social challenges stemming from such 
a transformation.

To  face  the  new  stresses  and  risks  facing  the  city 
today,  Paris  and  its  metropolitan  area  require  a 
revolution  of  the  same  magnitude,  a  shift  in  the 
way  of  thinking  about  the  future  and  managing 
the  territory,  to  provide  its  citizens  with  a  better 
quality  of  life,  protection  against  hazards,  and 
positive  prospects  for  the  future.  This  is  what  the 
resilient approach proposes.

Nudge

Reversibility

The  ability  to  revisit  what  we  have  done  -  for 
instance,  to  make  urbanised  spaces  more  natural, 
and to integrate this capacity into the architectural 
and urban production themselves.

Commons

Movement  to  explore  alternative  approaches  to 
the  governance  of  cities  as  means  of  altering  the 
way  citizens  and  administrations  perceive,  and 
manage  shared  urban  territories  and  spaces.  It 
works by creating new or alternative /collaborative 
arrangements between city administrators, citizens, 
and private property owners.

Living Labs

user-centred,  open-innovation 

A 
ecosystem, 
often  operating  in  a  territorial  context  (e.g.  city, 
neighbourhood),  integrating  concurrent  research 
and  innovation  processes  within  a  public-private-
people partnership.

Build Back Better

improvement  of  facilities, 

Aligned with the notion of recovery as the restoration 
and 
livelihoods  and 
living  conditions  of  disaster-affected  communities, 
including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors.

The  physical,  social,  and  psychological  aspects  of 
the  environment  that  influence  and  in  which  our 
choices  take  place  –  in  ways  that  promote  a  more 
preferred behaviour rather than obstruct it. Nudging 
offers  policy  makers  an  effective  way  to  influence 
citizens’  behaviour  without 
restricting 
freedom of choice, imposing mandatory obligations, 
or  introducing  new  taxations,  or  tax  reliefs.  It  is 
particularly interesting to use these methods when 
designing public facilities and public spaces.

further 

Tactical Urbanism

A  term  used  to  describe  a  collection  of  low-cost, 
temporary changes to the built environment, usually 
in cities, intended to improve local neighbourhoods 
and city gathering places. Tactical Urbanism is also 
commonly referred to as guerrilla urbanism, pop-up 
urbanism, city repair.

Temporary Urbanism

The notion that urban spaces do not need to remain 
void  when  undergoing  a  transition  on  their  usage. 
Through  temporary  urbanism,  actions  such  as  pop 
up  parks,  housing  art  exhibitions,  cafe  may  keep 
the place under transition as an asset for the urban 
space instead of a burden.

Modularity

Design  approach  that  subdivides  a  system  into 
smaller  parts  called  modules  or  skids,  that  can  be 
independently  created  and  then  used  in  different 
systems.  A  modular  system  can  be  characterised 
by  functional  partitioning  into  discrete  scalable, 
reusable  modules;  rigorous  use  of  well-defined 
modular interfaces, etc. It is a tool for flexibility and 
ingeniosity, two criteria of a resilient system.
