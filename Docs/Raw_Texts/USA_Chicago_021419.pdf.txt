SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

“Chicago stands ready to lead the way in developing meaningful solutions that  
empower our residents and strengthen our city today, and well into the future.”

– Mayor Rahm Emanuel

LETTER FROM THE MAYOR

From our early days as a frontier trading 
outpost to the thriving global city we are 
today, resilience has long been a hallmark 
of Chicago and our residents. As the “city 
of big shoulders,” resilience is woven into 
the very fabric of our identity. We rebuilt 
the  city  after  the  Great  Fire  of  1871  and 
reversed the flow of the Chicago River in 
1900 to protect our drinking water supply. 
We adapted and improved our response 
strategies  after  extreme  weather  events 
like the 1995 heat wave and 1967 and 2011 
blizzards. This pervasive spirit of resilience 
is a daily reminder of my distinct privilege 
to serve this city.

Chicago  is  in  a  unique  position  to  con-
tribute  to  the  worldwide  conversation 
about  resilience.  As  the  third  largest 
city  in  the  United  States,  Chicago  has 
over  2.7  million  residents  whose  diverse 
backgrounds  and  experiences  make 
up  the  backbone  of  our  great  city.  We 
have  an  abundant  fresh  water  supply, 
are  a  crossroads 
for  transportation 
infrastructure, and have one of the most 
diverse economies in the world. Economic 
opportunities are increasing in the central 
business  district  and  across  our  77 
community areas. Yet, for Chicago to fully 

prosper, every resident – especially those 
most  vulnerable  among  us  –  must  be 
included  in  the  city’s  long-term  growth. 
We  must  continue  to  confront  the  root 
causes  of  crime  and  gun  violence,  the 
destructive  legacy  of  segregation,  and 
the  resulting  inequities  that  still  exist  in 
too many communities today.

With this strategy, we are taking concrete 
steps towards ensuring Chicago remains 
a  resilient  city  that  can  build  on  the 
strengths of our past, while adapting to 
the challenges of the future. In many ways, 
this  strategy  represents  the  culmination 
of efforts across City departments, sister 
agencies,  community  groups,  and  other 
stakeholders  to  understand  the  impact 
that longstanding disconnection has had 
on our city. But this strategy also marks 
the beginning of a new agenda to address 
Chicago’s  challenges  and  empower  our 
residents  to  collectively  develop  urban 
resilience  strategies  that  transform  the 
future of our city.

As  Chicagoans,  we  are  committed 
to  reinvention  and  to  making  these 
meaningful  improvements.  We  have  the 
desire  and  the  potential  to  achieve  new 

levels  of  excellence.  We  seek  to  uplift 
our  vulnerable  residents  and  strengthen 
the  quality  of  life  for  all  Chicagoans 
today, tomorrow, and well into the future. 
Resilient  Chicago  encompasses  these 
values  and  represents  a  blueprint  for  a 
stronger,  more  resilient  city.  With  the 
release of Resilient Chicago, I look to the 
next Mayor of our great city, as well as the 
City  departments  and  agencies,  partner 
organizations,  community  groups,  and 
local leaders already so heavily involved, 
to  advance  this  ambitious  agenda.  I  am 
confident  in  their  collective  ability  to 
forge ahead.

Sincerely, 
Rahm Emanuel
Mayor
City of Chicago

RESILIENT CHICAGOLETTER FROM 100 RESILIENT CITIES

The  100  Resilient  Cities  (100RC)  team 
and I congratulate Mayor Rahm Emanuel 
and the people of Chicago on the release 
of  Resilient  Chicago.  This  city  has  set  a 
global example of how an urban resilience 
strategy,  anchored  in  collaboration  and 
transparency,  can  bring  communities 
together  to  take  on,  headfirst,  the 
challenges  and  opportunities  of  the 
future. 

Chicago is a major American metropolis, 
an 
important  cultural  and  economic 
center,  and  a  bustling  transportation 
hub.  Due  to  its  geographical  location 
and  strong  response  systems,  the  city 
has  withstood  and  rebounded  from 
major shocks in its history, such as fires, 
flooding,  and  snowstorms.  However,  the 
city  faces  the  challenges  of  an  unequal 
distribution  of  resources  and  access 
to  economic  and  social  opportunities. 
This  Resilience  Strategy  demonstrates, 
quite  exceptionally,  the  understanding 
that  urban  resilience  is  not  only  about 
effectively  preparing  and  responding 
to  acute,  sudden  shocks  such  as 
flooding  and  fires,  but  also,  maybe 
even  more  importantly,  acknowledging 

and  addressing  the  chronic  stresses 
weakening  the  fabric  and  ability  of  a 
city to function over time such as racial 
inequality and lack of social mobility.

leverage 

The  actionable  initiatives  contained  in 
this document are focused on neighbor-
hoods and their most vulnerable popula-
tions,  while  positioning  community 
partners  and  other  stakeholders  to 
deliver  real  change  with  support  from 
the  City  of  Chicago.  For  example,  the 
City  will 
longstanding 
partnership with Chicago’s electric utility, 
ComEd,  to  deliver  energy  efficiency 
improvements  to  residential  housing  in 
the  Bronzeville  neighborhood  as  part 
of  a  citywide  effort  to  reduce  energy 
costs  and  ultimate  housing  cost  burden 
for 
low-income  Chicagoans.  Another 
highlight of Chicago’s Resilience Strategy 
is  the  collection  of 
initiatives  that 
produce  multiple  co-benefits—focusing 
on  infrastructure  and  service  needs  to 
address  barriers  to  opportunities  for  all 
residents.  This  is  outlined  in  an  initiative 
that  I  am  personally  keen  on  following 
and  believe  will  serve  as  a  model  for 
cities around the world thinking through 

the  connection  between  mobility  and 
employment  opportunities.  The  Mobility 
Connections  to  Opportunities  initiative 
will  connect  the  Chicago  Department 
of  Transportation  with 
two  pilot 
neighborhoods in a series of community 
workshops; 
use 
transportation  planning  and  economic 
analysis 
identify  strategies  and 
solutions that demonstrate how Chicago 
can better use a variety of mobility assets 
to  connect  people  to  jobs  and  improve 
community livability.

participants  will 

to 

The strength of this Resilience Strategy, to 
honestly and boldly address the stresses 
and  shocks  of  the  City  of  Chicago,  is  a 
testament  to  the  tremendous  effort  of 
the Mayor’s Office, led by Chief Resilience 
Officer  (CRO)  Stefan  Schaffer.  Critical 
to  Stefan’s  work  was  the  engagement 
of  residents,  community  partners,  and 
City departments and sister agencies. In 
fact,  Stefan  and  his  team,  with  support 
from  100RC,  conducted  an  audit  of  the 
City’s  public  engagement  activities  to 
better  understand  what  the  City  was 
doing to engage the public and identify 
potential opportunities for improvement.

RESILIENT CHICAGOOne  of  the  findings  Stefan  and  his  team 
uncovered  was  an  opportunity  for  better 
collaboration  between  City  departments 
and  sister  agencies  as  well  as  with  the 
public.  This  insight  is  at  the  core  of  the 
initiatives  proposed  in  this  document. 
As  the  City  of  Chicago  prepares  itself  to 
welcome  new  mayoral  leadership,  this 
information  and  work  is  more  valuable 
than  ever  as  future  leadership  prepares 
to  prioritize  its  initiatives  and  goals  for 
Chicago’s future. 

Resilient  Chicago  is  about  empowering 
communities  to  collaborate  and  partner 
on solutions; ensuring their future is full of 
potential  and  that  their  local  government 
serves them well. This Resilience Strategy is 
an extraordinary achievement, but it is only 
the beginning. 100 Resilient Cities remains 
a  committed  partner  in  bringing  these 
pages to life. In working to implement the 
actionable  initiatives  outlined  within  this 
document, together we can build a Chicago 
that is more resilient and connected, in the 

pursuit  of  economic  opportunity,  safety, 
equity, and sustainability.

RESILIENT CHICAGOLETTER FROM THE  
RESILIENT CHICAGO 
STEERING COMMITTEE

It  has  been  an  honor  to  witness  the 
evolution and participate in the develop-
ment  of  Resilient  Chicago,  and  we  are 
excited  to  play  an  active  role  in  shaping 
how  this  strategy  will  come  to  life  over 
the coming years. Together we represent 
thirty-seven different public, private, non-
profit,  and  philanthropic  organizations. 
We have provided input according to our 
expertise and passion, shared insight from 
our experiences, and offered guidance on 
the  direction  of  the  strategy  to  address 
the  most  pressing  challenges  facing 
Chicagoans today and into the future. 

With  Mayor  Emanuel’s  announcement 
that he will not seek another term, there 
will  be  new  leadership  at  City  Hall.  As 
members  of  the  Steering  Committee, 
we  feel  it  is  important  for  the  City  to 
commit  to  continued 
implementation 
of  the  strategy  through  the  leadership 

transition. From the earliest conversations 
with Chicagoans expressing their needs to 
the  latter  stages  of  identifying  initiatives 
to  meet  these  needs,  we  believe  the 
final  strategy  presents  an  opportunity 
to  strengthen  Chicago  on  several  critical 
fronts.

The  various  initiatives  outlined  in  the 
strategy will continue to be advanced by 
City  departments  and  agencies  such  as 
the  Office  of  Emergency  Management 
and  Communication  (OEMC),  Chicago 
Department  of  Transportation  (CDOT), 
and  the  Department  of  Water  Manage-
ment (DWM). In addition, our Committee 
members, 
including  the  Metropolitan 
Planning  Council  (MPC),  the  Sierra  Club, 
and  Commonwealth  Edison  (ComEd) 
will carry on key collaborations with City 
departments  to  implement  the  strategy. 
In  addition  to  the  groups  mentioned 

above, all entities involved in the Steering 
Committee  are  committed  to  ensuring 
the  strategy’s  successful  implementation 
by  sharing  its  vision  with  our  platforms, 
continuing 
amongst 
the  Committee,  and  engaging  other 
organizations  and  community  members 
to support its implementation. 

conversations 

We  are  proud  to  be  a  part  of  the  City’s 
effort  to  address  Chicago’s  challenges 
through  strengthening  existing  initiatives 
forming  new  connections.  The 
and 
strategy  provides  a 
for 
improving Chicago’s resilience for years to 
come, and we look forward to continuing 
the work together.

RESILIENT CHICAGOEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  P.1  

Resilience – the ability to rebound quickly 
from  and  strengthen  a  city’s  capacity  to 
respond  to  shocks  or  stresses  –  is  not  a 
new  concept  for  Chicagoans.  Time  and 
again, the city has proven its ability to take 
on challenges and achieve unprecedented 
accomplishments.  After  the  Great  Fire 
of  1871,  Chicago  residents  helped  the 
city  rise  from  the  ashes  and  rebuilt  a 
stronger,  smarter,  and  reimagined  urban 
landscape  with  innovations  such  as  the 
modern  skyscraper.  With  the  reversal  of 
the Chicago River in 1900, Chicago took a 
critical step to protect the city’s supply of 
clean  drinking  water  and  Lake  Michigan. 
Chicago  has  taken  bold  steps  to  ensure 
that the city is well positioned to respond 
to  shocks  –  such  as  heat  waves  and 
blizzards – and stresses – such as crime, 
violence, and poverty.

Along with the city’s extraordinary assets, 
this  record  has  positioned  Chicago  to 
support more resilient communities for all 
its residents. Chicago’s location along Lake 
Michigan  provides  both  an  abundance 
of  fresh  water,  and  a  host  of  economic 
and recreational opportunities. The city’s 
central  location  has  long  made  it  the 
crossroads  of  America’s  transportation 
system,  serving  as  the  intersection  of 
many of the nation’s busiest railroads and 

interstates, and home to two world-class 
airports.  Chicago’s  central  location  also 
reduces  its  susceptibility  to  the  effects 
of  climate  change  and  natural  disasters 
such  as  wildfires,  hurricanes,  and  rising 
sea levels. Home to more than 400 major 
corporations,  recognized  as  the  most 
promising  city  for  foreign  investment  in 
the  Americas,  and  boasting  a  thriving 
local  business  community,  Chicago 
benefits from its many economic assets. 
Such  assets  have  made  Chicago  one  of 
the most diversified urban economies in 
the United States, with no single industry 
employing  more  than  14  percent  of  the 
city’s workforce.

Despite all of Chicago’s strengths, the city 
still faces many challenges. Chicago has 
long been a destination for those seeking 
a better life and greater opportunity, from 
the first non-indigenous settler of the city, 
Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, who settled 
on  the  north  bank  of  the  Chicago  River 
in  the  late  18th  century,  to  the  millions 
of  individuals  from  different  racial  and 
ethnic  backgrounds  who  have  since 
followed.  This  rich  history  of  migration 
and immigration has undoubtedly shaped 
the character and vibrancy of Chicago’s 
neighborhoods: 
discriminatory 
practices  and  policies  have  caused 

yet 

disparities that disproportionately burden 
Chicago’s  most  vulnerable  residents. 
These  disparities,  which  often  fall  along 
geographic,  racial,  and  socioeconomic 
lines, notably exist in the areas of public 
safety, economic opportunity, educational 
attainment,  and  transportation  access, 
among numerous others.

As the result of the strategy development 
process  and  to  focus  the  efforts  of 
Resilient Chicago, four pressing resilience 
challenges were identified:

•  Reducing disparities between 

Chicago’s neighborhoods;

•  Addressing the root causes of crime 

and violence;

•  Ensuring the provision of critical 

infrastructure; and,

•  Promoting engaged, prepared, and 

cohesive communities.

Resilient Chicago seeks to address these 
challenges by creating a more connected 
city where residents, neighborhoods, insti-
tutions,  corporations,  and    government 
agencies  are  successfully  connected  in 
pursuit  of  economic  opportunity,  safety, 
security, and sustainability for all.

RESILIENT CHICAGOResilient Chicago is organized into three 
resilience pillars – Strong Neighborhoods, 
Robust 
Infrastructure,  and  Prepared 
Communities  –  and  establishes  12  goals

support these pillars.

as  a  living  document  and  recognizes 
urban resilience is an ongoing challenge. 
Together,  the  efforts  outlined  in  this 
strategy serve to equip Chicago to face 
its challenges head on and prepare it for 
a future of success and growth.

WHAT IS URBAN RESILIENCE?

Cities  and  urban  environments  are 
becoming  more  diverse,  dynamic, 
connected,  and  unpredictable.  This  is 
especially  evident  in  Chicago,  the  heart 
of  the  Midwest.  Chicago  is  exposed  to 
global, regional, and local challenges and 
must be positioned to respond to these 
challenges effectively and efficiently. 

A city’s resilience is defined by the ability of its individuals, institutions, businesses, 
and systems within the community to survive, adapt, and grow despite the chronic 
stresses or acute shocks it experiences. A truly resilient city is not only expected 
to perform well in good times but also recover expediently after challenges. 

 

100  Resilient  Cities  -  Pioneered  by  The 
Rockefeller  Foundation  (100RC) 
- 
provides support and resources for cities 
to  build  urban  resilience  and  address 
social, economic, and physical challenges. 
100RC  was  created  on  the  Rockefeller 
Foundation’s  Centennial  in  2013  and 
began working with an initial group of 32 
cities. Chicago was selected as a resilient 
city in the second wave of applications.

100RC Cities Across the Globe 
100RC helps cities become more resilient 
by  financing  the  strategy  development 
process  and  a  Chief  Resilience  Officer 
(CRO)  position.  100RC  also  provides 
cities  technical  assistance  and  access 
to  the  services  of  global  partners,  who 
share  subject  matter  expertise  and 
aid  in  resilience  strategy  development. 
This  global  network  enables  member 
cities  to  directly  collaborate,  exchange 
best  practices,  and  amplify  successful 
initiatives.

The City Resilience Framework (CRF) is a 
unique framework, developed by Arup with 
support from the Rockefeller Foundation, 
that  provides  a  lens  to  understand  the 
complexity  of  cities  and  the  drivers  that 
contribute to their resilience. 

Looking  at  these  drivers  can  help  cities 
to assess the extent of their resilience, to 
identify critical areas of weakness, and to 
identify actions and programs to improve 
the city’s resilience. 

The  CRF  is  based  on  four  dimensions 
essential  to  the  urban  resilience  of  any 
city:  (1)  Health  and  Well-Being,  (2) 
Economy  and  Society,  (3)  Infrastructure 
and Environment, and (4) Leadership and 
Strategy. Each of the four dimensions is 
further  defined  by  additional  drivers  of 
resilience. 

In developing Resilient Chicago, the CRF 
was  used  to  assess  Chicago’s  relative 
strengths  and  weaknesses  and  identify 
areas of focus to improve the city’s overall 
resilience.

ROOTS OF CHICAGO’S RESILIENCEP.1  

Chicago  is  one  of  the  most  diverse, 
creative,  and  innovative  cities  in  the 
United States. Located in the heart of the 
Midwest,  it  has  long  been  a  connector 
between  the  nation’s  two  coasts.  As  a 

major city in such a critical location, it is 
also home to one of the most prosperous 
economic centers in the country. Chicago’s 
resilience is deeply rooted in its history – 
be it through surviving a combination of 

natural and manmade shocks and stresses 
or proactively implementing initiatives to 
improve future responses and strengthen 
neighborhoods and communities.

RESILIENT CHICAGOThe  Great  Fire  of  1871  caused 
tremendous devastation that could 
have  led  to  Chicago’s  decline,  but 
instead was taken as an opportunity 
to  reimagine  the  city  skyline  and 
streets.  Less  than  30  years  later, 
this  renaissance  continued  from 
land  to  water  with  the  reversal  of 
the  Chicago  River  to  protect  Lake 
Michigan,  the  city’s  drinking  water 
supply.

Blizzards  such  as  those  in  1967 
and  2011  have  led  to  advanced 
technologies  and  snow  removal 
strategies  that  enable  the  city 
to  anticipate  and  respond  more 
efficiently  to  similar  events  in  the 
future.

The  1995  heat  wave  resulted  in  the  tragic  loss  of  over  700 
lives.  The  devastating  impact  underscored  the  vital  need  for  
community  resilience  and  ultimately  led  residents,  community 
groups,  institutions,  and  government  to  collectively  develop 
community-based strategies to prepare vulnerable residents for 
future extreme events.

The era of urban renewal of the mid-20th century 
that sought to revitalize the city through large 
scale infrastructure investments – including the 
expansion  of  the  city’s  expressway  system  – 
precipitated the mass displacement of residents 
from  their  communities  and  exacerbated  the 
disconnect  between  neighborhoods.  The  city 
has  sought  to  reverse  the  legacy  of  these 
policies through strategic neighborhood investments, 
affordable housing initiatives, and the reconnection of 
residents and communities.

Though  the  city  has  successfully  imple-
mented  strategies  to  overcome  chal-
lenges it has faced, many Chicago neigh-
borhoods  still  grapple  with  significant 
hardship  due  to  a  history  of  neglect, 
disconnection,  and  discrimination.  The 
consequences  of  redlining,  the  creation 

of and subsequent disregard for housing 
projects, and the unequal distribution of 
city  resources  linger  to  this  day.  Demo-
graphic shifts, declining populations, and 
lack of investment are only a few exam-
ples of the effects of this history, dispro-
portionately  experienced  by  the  city’s 

most  vulnerable  residents.  Moreover, 
the  city  faces  new  challenges  such  as  a 
changing  climate  and  economy,  which 
must be addressed in ways that build re-
silience  for  the  future.  Resilient  Chicago 
was developed to meet these needs.

RESILIENT CHICAGOSTEP 2: UNDERSTAND 
EXISTING EFFORTS

To understand existing efforts to improve 
Chicago’s resilience and identify current 
gaps  in  resilience  actions  citywide,  two 
distinct inventories of ongoing initiatives 
were conducted.

The first analysis was carried out through a 
review of five plans previously developed 
by the City of Chicago1  to gain a detailed 
understanding  of  the  progress  that  has 
been made in key resilience areas.

The  second  analysis  was  conducted 
through an examination of a broad cross-
section of 184 plans, programs, initiatives, 
policies,  and  studies 
from  various 
stakeholders, compiled from workshops, 
focus  groups,  meetings,  press  releases, 
and other sources. 

These  analyses  revealed  that  resilience 
actions  relating  to  critical  infrastruc-
ture,  transportation,  environment,  and  
sustainability are strongly represented in 
ongoing efforts.

Additionally,  it  was  clear  that  a  large 
number  of  initiatives  exist  to  improve 
Chicago’s  resilience 
in  the  areas  of 
education and public safety, which have 
been  consistent  areas  of  focus  for  the 
Emanuel administration.

RESILIENT CHICAGOSTEP 3: SYNTHESIZE RESULTS

With a clearer understanding of Chicago’s 
shocks, stresses, strengths, and weaknesses, 
as well as existing efforts to build resilience, 
the  CRO  was  better  equipped  to  identify 
the key resilience challenges that Chicago 
uniquely faces.

From  this  process,  four  key  resilience 
challenges  emerged,  which  drive  the 
focus  and  prioritization  of 
initiatives 
within Resilient Chicago:

①  Reducing disparities between 

Chicago’s neighborhoods

②  Addressing the root causes of crime 

and violence

③  Ensuring the provision of critical 

infrastructure

④  Promoting engaged, prepared, and 

cohesive communities

1 9

RESILIENT CHICAGOPHASE 2:   ANALYSIS OF ROOT CAUSES 
                  AND SOLUTIONS DEVELOPMENT

The  CRO  and  his  team  conducted 
additional research to explore promising 
opportunities to address the root causes 
of Chicago’s four key resilience challenges 
that emerged from Phase 1. 

The CRO engaged key stakeholders and 
regularly convened a Steering Committee 
of  over  40  leaders  from  public,  private, 
non-profit,  and  philanthropic  sectors 
to  review  findings,  exchange  ideas,  and 
develop a strategy framework that would 
effectively  address  the  city’s  specific 
needs.

Through  these  efforts,  it  became  clear

RESILIENT CHICAGOCHICAGO’S KEY RESILIENCE CHALLENGES
REDUCING DISPARITIES BETWEEN CHICAGO’S NEIGHBORHOODS
Chicago  has  always  been  a  city  of 
enormous  diversity.  In  2016,  the  city’s 
population was 32.3 percent white, 30.6 
percent  Black  or  African  American,  29.1 
percent  Hispanic  or  Latino,  6.0  percent 
Asian,  1.6  percent  multi-racial,  and  0.4 
percent  American  Indian,  Alaska  Native, 
Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, or 
some  other  race.  The  city’s  rich  history 

in  America.  Opportunity  is  not  equally  
accessible, 
hardship 
is  experienced  disproportionately  by 
Chicago’s Black and Latino residents, who 
largely reside in the city’s South, Southwest, 
West, and Northwest Sides. Black and Latino 
residents are more than twice as likely to be 
unemployed  and  face  significant  barriers 
accessing  services.  These  socioeconomic 

of immigration and culture is reflected in 
its  people,  with  residents  from  over  140 
countries  and  more  than  100  languages 
spoken.

However,  Chicago’s  communities  remain 
largely  divided  along  racial  and  socio- 
economic lines. The city consistently ranks 
among the top five most segregated cities

to  significant 
health  disparities  in  communities  and 
prevent many people from living healthy 
lives. Over the past several decades, key 
decision  makers  –  including  developers 
and banks – have failed to invest equitably 
in communities of color. This has created 
a  spiraling  effect  of  depopulation, 
disinvestment, 
and  disproportionate 
public health impacts that persist to this 
day.
 
In  recent  years,  dramatic  steps  have 
been  taken  to  promote  greater  access 
to  opportunity  and  higher  quality 
of  life  for  all  of  Chicago’s  residents. 
Increasingly,  businesses  are  setting  up 
shop  on  the  South  and  West  Sides, 
including  the  new  Method  soap  factory 
in  the  Pullman  neighborhood,  Whole 
Foods in Englewood, and the NorthPoint 
Development Distribution Center on the 
Southeast Side. The City of Chicago also 
announced  that  its  Fleet  and  Facility 
Management 
and  Chicago 
Park  District  (CPK)  headquarters  will 
to  Englewood  and  Brighton 
move 
Park,  respectively,  and 
its  upcoming 
Joint  Public  Safety  Training  Academy 
will  be  located  in  West  Garfield  Park. 
These  types  of  strategic  investments 
are  creating  thousands  of 
jobs  for 
residents  in  neighborhoods  that  have 
been  historically  isolated  from  the  city’s 
economic fortunes. 

(FFM) 

The  City  of  Chicago  is  also  working  to 
ensure  that  every  child  has  access  to  a 
quality education. In 2012, Chicago Public 
Schools  (CPS)  extended  its  school  day 
and  year,  providing  CPS  students  with 
nearly two and a half years of additional 
instruction  between  kindergarten  and 
high  school  graduation.  For  residents 
seeking  higher  education,  a  college 
degree is now more accessible than ever 
before.  With  the  launch  of  the  STAR 
Scholarship  program  in  2015,  any  CPS 
student that graduates with a B average 
(3.0+  GPA)  can  attend  any  City  College 
of Chicago for free. Finally, in 2018, Mayor 
Emanuel  announced  his  commitment 
to  make  free,  full-day  universal  pre-
kindergarten  available  to  every  Chicago 
family, regardless of income.

Despite the City’s commitment to promote 
prosperity  for  all  Chicagoans  through  a 
variety  of  ongoing  initiatives,  analyses 
conducted  during  the  development  of 
this  strategy  revealed  several  areas  of 
opportunity.  These  included  improving 
coordination  between  City  departments 
and 
reducing 
unemployment, 
improving  access  to 
economic opportunity, and ensuring that 
the basic needs of all residents are met.

RESILIENT CHICAGOUNDERSTANDING CHICAGO’S DISPARITIES:
THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP INDEX

ECONOMIC HARDSHIP INDEX
The Economic Hardship Index1 compares 
social and economic conditions between 
Chicago communities. The hardship index 
is a relative composite of six indicators:
  (i)  Crowded housing (percentage of 
occupied housing units with more 
than one person per room);

 (ii)  Poverty (percentage of persons 
living below the federal poverty 
level);

(iii)  Unemployment (percentage of 

persons over the age of 16 years  
who are unemployed);

(iv)  Education (percentage of persons 
over the age of 25 years without a 
high school education);

 (v)  Dependency (percentage of the 

population under 18 or over 64 years 
of age); and

(vi) Income (per capita income).
The  hardship  index  provides  a  more 
complete,  multidimensional  measure  of 
community  socioeconomic  conditions 
than individual measures such as income 
or employment alone. A community with 
a  high  hardship  index  score  has  worse 
social  and/or  economic  conditions  than 
a  community  with  a  low  or  medium 
hardship score.

RESILIENT CHICAGOADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE
Crime  and  violence  undermine  Chicago 
communities  by  threatening  the  health 
and  well-being  of  the  city’s  residents. 
Despite  a  downward  trend  in  murders 
nationally,  Chicago  suffered 
from  a 
sudden 58 percent increase in homicides 
in 2016, with 762 reported in total. Non-
violent crimes, including property crimes 
such as car theft and vandalism, occurred 
at  even  higher  numbers.  While  these 
trends have improved in recent years, the 
risk  of  being  crime-involved,  by  either 
committing  or  falling  victim  to  a  crime, 
still affects far too many Chicagoans.

To avert the devastating effects of crime 
and  violence,  the  City  of  Chicago  has  a 
responsibility  to  make  Chicago  safe  for 
all  residents.  This  is  especially  true  for 
residents of certain South and West Side 
communities, where historical data show 
crime  and  violence  are  more  likely  to 
occur. To this end, the City has sought to 
improve public safety by investing in new 
policing  initiatives,  expanding  violence 
prevention programs, and taking concrete 
steps to promote community trust.

The  City  has  invested  in  over  1,000 
additional  police  officers,  field  training 
officers,  sergeants,  and 
lieutenants, 
implemented  an  extra  40  hours  of 
for  every  officer  annually,

RESILIENT CHICAGOsuch as Becoming a Man and Working on 
Womanhood, and reconnection hubs for 
Chicago’s disconnected youth. 

The City has also taken significant steps 
to restore and build community trust. As 
of  2017,  all  Chicago  patrol  officers  have 
been equipped with a body camera and 
the City has adopted a new policy where 
all  audio,  video,  and  documents  from 
officer-involved shootings and excessive 
force  cases  are  released  within  60  days 
of a complaint being filed. More recently, 
the  City  has  crafted  a  consent  decree 
alongside  the  State  Attorney  General’s 
Office that will add independent oversight 
and yield lasting reforms of the Chicago 
Police Department.

Despite  these  major  strides,  systemic 
changes  to  address  the  root  causes  of 
crime  and  violence  are  still  needed  to 
create  long-lasting  change  to  enhance 
public  safety  outcomes.  While  many 
actions have been taken to improve law 
enforcement 
and  police-community 
relations,  additional  steps  can  be  taken 
that  drive  at  the  inherent  link  between 
economic security, access to opportunity, 
and  community  safety. 
In  this  vein, 
Resilient  Chicago  envisions  a  safer 
Chicago for its residents by focusing on 
initiatives  that  improve  communication 
between  government  and 
residents, 
promote  affordability,  and 
increase 
access to jobs and mobility.

approaches  to  policing.  The  creation 
of  hyper-local  intelligence  centers  and 
the  use  of  advanced  mobile  phone 
technology,  gunshot  detection  systems, 
and  crime  cameras  all  inform  Chicago’s 
smart  policing  strategy  and  cover  over 
half  the  city  today.  These  solutions 
enable the Chicago Police Department to 
utilize  real-time  data  and  monitoring  to 
make better, more timely decisions  – yet 
policing alone is not the answer. 

Crime  and  violence  are  symptoms  of 
deeper,  often  entrenched  challenges 
that communities face – including limited 
economic opportunity and lack of social 
cohesion.  Far  too  often,  it  is  Chicago’s 
youth that experience the impacts of crime, 
violence, and trauma, the ramifications of 
which  can  extend  for  years  to  come.  In 
this vein, the City has invested in summer 
employment  opportunities  such  as  One 
Summer  Chicago,  mentoring  programs

ENSURING THE PROVISION OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Chicago 
leading 
transportation hub for people and goods 
due  to  its  natural  assets  and  central 
location  within  the  United  States.  The 
city’s  earliest  non-indigenous  explorers 
the  economic  potential 
recognized 
intrinsic  to 
its  waterways  and  Lake 
Michigan  and  laid  roots  accordingly.  By 
the mid-19th century, nearly a dozen rail 
lines crisscrossed the city, carrying goods 
like grain, timber, and meat, and spurring 
the rapid growth of new industries. With 
booming  commerce  and  the  promise 
of  economic  opportunity, 
individuals 
relocated  to  Chicago  en  masse,  often 
by  rail.  By  the  turn  of  the  20th  century, 
Chicago’s  population  had  grown  to 
nearly 1.7 million residents and, by 1950, 
had more than doubled to over 3.6 million 
residents.

The ability for people and goods to move 
freely  throughout  Chicago  remains  core 
to  the  city’s  long-term  success.  Today, 
Chicago is home to several regional and 
national transportation systems including 
major railroad lines, freeways, a port, and 
two of the nation’s busiest airports. The 
city has more than 4,000 miles of streets 
and  alleys  that  serve  motorists,  buses, 
trucks,  cyclists,  and  pedestrians  alike. 
The  Chicago  Transit  Authority  (CTA)  – 
the second largest public transportation 
system in the United States – provides 1.6

service  is  complemented  by  the  Divvy 
bike  share  program  as  well  as  Metra 
rail  and  Pace  bus  lines,  which  connect 
the  surrounding  six-county  Chicago 
metropolitan area.

transportation 

Even with these tremendous assets, many 
Chicagoans  still  remain  disconnected 
from  adequate 
infra-
structure  and  service.  This 
lack  of 
mobility  isolates  residents  and  limits 
access  to  economic,  educational,  and 
recreational  opportunities,  particularly 
for  residents  living  on  the  outer  edges 
of  the  city  where  work  commutes  and 
other  travel  times  can  exceed  an  hour 
by transit. While more than $8 billion of 
historic  public  transit  investments  have 
been  completed  or  announced  and 
2,000  miles  of  alleys  and  roads  have 
been  repaved  through  Mayor  Emanuel’s 
Building  A  New  Chicago  initiative,  the 
City must remain committed to investing 
in  new  and  existing 
transportation 
infrastructure  and  services  that  support 
emerging  mobility  options  to  better 
connect Chicagoans across the city.

a 

robust 

Although 
transportation 
network is crucial to Chicago’s resilience, 
the  City  must  also  protect  something 
more elemental – its fresh water supply. 
Lake  Michigan  contains  approximately 
five  percent  of  Earth’s  fresh  water 
and  is  the  source  of  two  of  the  world’s 

largest  water  plants:  the  Jardine  Water 
Purification  Plant  and  the  South  Water 
Purification Plant. Over 5.5 million people 
in Chicago and its adjacent communities 
rely on these two facilities for clean water, 
which is distributed through a sprawling 
network of water mains.

However, like many large cities, Chicago 
faces  the  daunting  task  of  replacing  its 
outdated  water  and  sewer  mains,  of 
which approximately a quarter are more 
than  a  century  old.  Mayor  Emanuel’s 
Building  a  New  Chicago  initiative  has 

tripled the number of annual water main 
replacements to protect the system from 
contaminants and reduce water loss. The 
City conducts over 600,000 analyses of 
tap water every year to ensure the public’s 
health. To build on this progress, the City 
must  continue  to  upgrade  its  critical 
water  infrastructure  while  enhancing  its 
water use and management practices, for 
example, by pursuing investments in green 
infrastructure  to  protect  communities 
from increased flood risk and identifying 
new operational efficiencies.

The City will pilot innovative solutions in two Chicago communities: 
Gage Park and Washington Heights, to improve connections between 
communities lacking mobility options with employment opportunities.

CHICAGO CLIMATE CHARTER
The Chicago Climate Charter is an international pledge that establishes 
a framework of commitments that focus on ideas to maximize impact 
and provide guidance for Mayors who are looking to peers for climate

CHICAGO ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
IMPROVEMENTS
In 2018, Chicago updated its Chicago Energy Benchmarking Ordinance 
to provide a new Chicago Energy Rating system that promotes trans-
parency and visibility of reported data surrounding energy performance 
of new and existing buildings.

BUILDING STORMWATER RESILIENCE
THROUGH GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE
This initiative will improve the coordination of green infrastructure  
investments and a pilot project across Austin, Auburn Gresham/Engle-
wood, and Calumet Heights to implement on-site green infrastructure 
solutions to be designed by fall 2019.

EXPANDING TRANSIT-ORIENTED 
DEVELOPMENT (TOD) TO BUS ROUTES
While the majority of City TOD policies have focused on rail stations and 
individual bus projects, in 2019, the City will expand its TOD policy to 
bus lines to promote equitable development, affordability, and 
connection between neighborhoods.

URBAN AGRICULTURE STRATEGY AND  
THE GROWING FOR CHICAGO INITIATIVE
The City will establish an urban agriculture strategy to expand urban 
farms in the city and improve food security for residents. The Growing 
for Chicago initiative is a cohort-based model that supports high- 
potential small farmers through financial support, technical assistance, 
and community support.

YOUTH QUALITY OF LIFE (YQL) INDEX 
AND SCORECARD
The City is developing the YQL Index and Scorecard to assess the impact 
of government investments on the lives of youth over time. The Index

PILLAR 1: STRONG NEIGHBORHOODS

Chicago  has  always  been  a  city  of 
neighborhoods. The bodegas, panaderias, 
and  colorful  murals  of  Pilsen,  rich  jazz 
history  of  Bronzeville,  black-owned  West 
Suburban  Journal  in  Austin,  Villapalooza 
music  festival  in  North  Lawndale,  historic 
landmarks  in  Pullman,  606  trail  winding 
through  Bucktown,  and  Logan  Square 
Farmers Market are but a few examples of 
the distinct contributions of neighborhoods 
that make Chicago a diverse, vibrant, and 
world-class city.

As the city changes over time, it is critical 
that all neighborhoods have the resources, 
support,  and  tools  to  thrive.  Strong 
neighborhoods mean a strong Chicago.

Neighborhood 
Opportunity  Fund,  Retail  Thrive  Zones, 
and  Chicago’s  microlending  program 
have  injected  resources  and  support  into 
historically  underserved  neighborhoods 
on the South, Southwest, and West Sides. 
Employment opportunities are on the rise, 
and Chicago’s unemployment rate is at its 
lowest level in recorded history.

Chicago’s youth have benefited from these

neighborhoods  by  ensuring 
that  all 
Chicagoans  –  regardless  of  the  zip  code 
in  which  they  reside  –  can  participate 
in  Chicago’s  future.  Examples 
include 
initiatives to develop skill sets for younger

since  the  start  of  the  decade,  and  today 
more  young  men  and  women  across  the 
city have access to after school activities, 
summer  jobs,  and  mentors.  Chicago  has 
dramatically  expanded  access  to  early

college free for high school graduates who 
have earned at least a B average.

It  is  imperative  that  Chicago’s  ongoing 
development  be  inclusive  and  that  all 
neighborhoods share in the city’s prosperity. 
Today,  18.6  percent  of  Chicagoans  live 
below the poverty threshold, and a greater

CASE STUDY 

Co-Located Housing 
and Libraries 

OVERVIEW
The  Chicago  Housing  Authority  (CHA) 
and  Chicago  Public  Library 
(CPL), 
with  the  support  of  the  Department 
of  Planning  and  Development  (DPD), 
created  an  interagency  partnership  that 
will  provide  three  new  mixed-income 
housing  developments  with  co-located 
libraries  across  the  city  to  serve  as 
community  anchors  that 
incorporate 
traditional  library  services  and  support 
life-long learning.

The  Roosevelt  Branch  Library  will  be 
co-located  with  73  multi-family  housing 
units, expanding upon the redevelopment 
of  the  Roosevelt  Square  neighborhood. 
The  Northtown  Branch  Library  and  the 
Independence  Branch  Library,  situated 
in  the  West  Ridge  and 
Irving  Park 
communities,  respectively,  will  both  be 
co-located  with  a  total  of  44  units  of 
senior housing. 

Three  of  the  city’s  top  architecture  and 
design  firms  were  selected  to  design 
the  housing  and  library  developments. 
The  firms  were  selected  following  a 
design  competition  sponsored  by  DPD. 
The  competition  was  part  of  Mayor 
Emanuel’s  vision  to  bring  world-class 
design to Chicago neighborhoods rather 
than  the  standard  architectural  designs 

that have become commonplace among 
government  buildings  and  planning 
projects.

BENEFITS
These  new  developments  and  their 
co-housed 
strengthen 
communities  by  creating  additional 
affordable 
housing  options,  while 
simultaneously making library resources

DESCRIPTION
As a Chicago resident or community group, 
it can be a challenge identifying, accessing, 
and utilizing the various services, programs, 
and  other  resources  made  available  by 
City departments and sister agencies. This 
poses  a  significant  barrier  for  residents 
and  community  groups  to  meaningfully 
leverage City offerings that can benefit their 
neighborhoods.
 
The  Mayor’s  Office, 
in  collaboration 
with  CDPH,  GCFD,  and  other  key  City 

This initiative will serve as a model to improve 
the 
implementation  of  neighborhood 
priorities  –  due  to  stronger  connections 
between  the  City,  community  groups, 
and  residents  –  with  the  longer-term  goal 
of  implementing  this  framework  in  high-
hardship community areas citywide.

RESILIENT CHICAGOCALL TO ACTION

FIND WAYS TO CONNECT WITH  
THOSE AROUND YOU!
Being an active member of your community 
–  by  volunteering  at  a  local  soup  kitchen, 
joining a faith-based organization, or simply 
checking in on your next-door neighbor from 
time to time – helps build your community’s 
resilience by strengthening the connections 
between its residents.

INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO  
YOUR NEIGHBORS
Everyone loves seeing a friendly face in their 
neighborhood!  Building  relationships  with 
your  neighbors  creates  a  stronger  sense 
of  belonging,  builds  trust,  and  results  in  a 
positive community living experience.

SIGN UP TO BE A MEMBER OF A 
NEIGHBORHOOD CLUB
Getting to know your neighbors as part of a 
local group – such as a neighborhood book 
club – can open doors to new friendships, 
hobbies,  and  interests  that  make  living  in 
your area more enjoyable.

INVESTMENT LEVERAGED 
THROUGH COMMUNITY  
ACTION IN COMMUNITIES 
WITH HISTORIC  
UNDERINVESTMENT

Residents  living  in  the  city’s  South,  Southwest,  and 
West  Side  communities  have  long  grappled  with 
underinvestment, a lack of access to capital, and fewer 
economic  opportunities.  This  goal  addresses  these 
issues by identifying initiatives focused on activating 
residents in Chicago’s neighborhoods and promoting 
employment and growth within those areas.

Opportunity Fund

OVERVIEW
The  Neighborhood  Opportunity  Fund 
(NOF), created by the Mayor’s Office and 
DPD and approved by City Council in 2016, 
links the city’s rapid growth in downtown 
development to capital streams necessary 
for  the  success  of  small  businesses  in 
Chicago’s  South,  Southwest,  and  West 
Side neighborhoods.
 
As  part  of  this  equitable  development 
initiative,  developers  of  downtown 
projects pay a Neighborhood Opportunity 
Bonus into the NOF, which enables them 
to  increase  the  size  of  their  downtown 
development.  Eighty  percent  of  bonus 
contributions  are  used 
to  support 
development  and  rehabilitation  projects 
within commercial corridors in Chicago’s 
underinvested neighborhoods. Examples 
of eligible projects include grocery stores, 
restaurants, and cultural facilities, among 
others,  with  emphasis  given  to  projects 
that include Minority Business Enterprise 
(MBE) and Women’s Business Enterprise 
(WBE) owners.

and  connecting  business  owners  with 
the  necessary  supporting 
resources 
–  including  contracting,  financial,  and 
legal services – to complete their capital 
projects  and  improve  operations.  The 
City  will  continue  to  provide  NOF  grant

and  approves  applications  based  on 
project  feasibility  and  ability  to  have 
a  measurable,  catalytic  impact  on  a 
community  based  on  the  availability  of 
similar goods or services nearby. A total 
of  90  projects  have  been  selected  for 
support,  including  grants  for  emerging 
start-ups,  the  creation  of  new  locations, 
upgrades  to  local  anchor  businesses, 
and  business  expansions.  The  program 
has  driven  a  total  of  more  than  $55 
million  of  new  investment  to  Chicago’s 
neighborhoods,  with  over  75  percent 
of  awardees  from  African  American  or

Retail Thrive Zones

OVERVIEW
Created  in  2017,  the  Retail  Thrive  Zones 
initiative  is  a  pilot  program  focused  on 
strengthening 
the  economic  vitality 
of  eight  neighborhood  commercial 
corridors.  Each  of  the  Retail  Thrive 
Zone  corridors,  located  on  the  city’s 
South, Southwest, and West Sides, have 
historically  faced  economic  challenges, 
yet  demonstrate  a  strong  potential  for 
growth.  The  program  brings  an  array 
of  City  tools  and  services,  including 
financial  and  technical  assistance,  to 
entrepreneurs and businesses to catalyze 
these  corridors  and  improve  access  to 
amenities,  promote  entrepreneurship, 
and  build  community-based  wealth  and 
employment.

By focusing on select areas, the City can 
roll  out  programs  more  quickly,  explore 
creative  new  ideas,  and  expand  those 
ideas  that  are  successful  to  other  parts 
of the city.

Since its inception, the three-year program 
has focused primarily on three goals:

1)   Increase access to capital and 

incentives through Retail Thrive Zone 
Small Business Improvement Fund 
(SBIF) grants, 7(c) tax incentives, 
outreach to lenders, and the creation 
of a Thrive SBIF lenders collective;

2)  Activate real estate and aligned 
infrastructure through new pre-
fabricated, climate-controlled 
“Boombox” pop-up retail spaces, 
property violation coordination work 
with the Department of Buildings, and 
early action infrastructure such as 
road, light, and sidewalk repair;

3)  Support existing small businesses and 

emerging entrepreneurs. With the 
remaining year left in this program, 
the City will focus on supporting 
the completion of SBIF projects and 
getting buildings in compliance to 
be development-ready. Residents

BENEFITS 
This initiative will improve the quality of 
life in neighborhoods by combatting the 
economic  conditions  that  lead  to  crime 
and prioritizing historically underinvested 
communities.  The  Retail  Thrive  Zones 
initiative 
invested  $16  million 
directly  into  commercial  strips  in  eight 
neighborhoods  across  Chicago’s  South, 
Southwest,  and  West  Sides,  including 
Austin,  Back  of  the  Yards,  Bronzeville, 
Chatham, Englewood, South Shore, West 
Humboldt Park, and West Pullman. These 
investments in neighborhood commercial 
corridors are expected to create new local 
amenities  and  more  than  650  new  jobs, 
along  with  nearly  2,000  construction-
related  jobs.  Grants  of  up  to  $250,000 
are  awarded  to  small  businesses.  To 
date,  51  businesses  have  received  Retail 
Thrive  Zone  business 
improvement 
grants.  In  addition,  partnering  lenders 
are  offering  matching  loan  programs 
to  help  front-fund  grant  projects  and 
provide  short-term  operating  capital. 
The  City  also  launched  a  web  portal,  
thrivezones.com,  that  increases  acces-
sibility for businesses to apply for County 
property  tax  incentives  in  the  Thrive 
Zones.

DESCRIPTION
Urban  agriculture  strengthens  Chicago’s 
local 
residents 
access to nutritional food options as well as 
environmental and community benefits. To 
support urban farming and promote resident 
access to healthy and locally grown foods, 
Chicago  updated  its  zoning  code  in  2011 
by expanding the size limit for community 
gardens,  permitting  hydroponics  and 

aquaponics as part of urban farm uses, and 
updating  the  health  code  in  2015  to  allow 
for  expanded  composting  at  community 
gardens  and  farms.  In  summer  2018,  DPD 
partnered  with  DCASE  to  establish  Farm 
to  Festival,  an  urban  agricultural  exhibit 
featuring growing, cooking, and nutritional 
demonstrations.  Moving  forward,  the  City 
will  create  an  urban  agriculture  strategy 
with additional incentives and resources for 
producers. 

To  help  community  farmers  scale  their 
businesses,  the  City  will  work  with  non-
profit  partners  to  create  the  Growing  for 
Chicago  initiative,  a  cohort-based  model 
for  small,  local  farmers.  The  program  will 
provide  grants  for  capital  investments, 
technical  assistance  and  training,  among 
other community and City support. Initially, 
the  effort  will  be  focused  in  areas  where 
the  City  and  its  partners  are  currently 
developing 
land  for  urban  agriculture, 
including Englewood, South Chicago, Back

DESCRIPTION
The  CRO  met  with  community  members 
and  City  of  Chicago  staff  to  understand 
how  the  City’s  engagement  with  the 
public  can  more  consistently  promote  a 
productive,  two-way  relationship.  As  part 
of these conversations, CSLN – a network 
of  community  leaders  that  advocates  for 
more  sustainable  communities  in  Chicago 
– emphasized the importance of improved 

challenges,  and  identify  opportunities  for 
improvements in engagement strategies.  

Challenges shared included:
•  Over-reliance on communication 

channels to inform – rather than engage – 
the public;

•  Failure to engage underserved or 

vulnerable populations in a consistent 
manner;

•  Inconsistent standards and limited 

professional development opportunities; 

•  Lack of coordination in deployment of 

dedicated public engagement resources.

Areas of opportunity identified included:
• Ability to share effective tactics and best 
practices already being used by staff;
•  Existence of effective partnerships and 

strong relationships that can serve as 
models;

•  Interest and desire among staff to learn 

new skills and continuously develop; 

•   Articulation of public engagement as a 

priority by the current administration.

These findings were analyzed to create 
initial recommendations to enhance the

and  agencies  to  more  effectively  engage 
the public on key initiatives. Although there 
are  examples  of  successful  collaborations, 
many  efforts  are  fragmented  across  City 
departments and agencies, which can leave 
residents  feeling  disconnected  from  local 
government.

It  also  became  clear  that  the  lack  of  a 
baseline 
inventory  of  existing  public 
engagement  strategies  used  by  City 
departments and agencies limits the ability 
for 
intragovernmental  coordination.  A 
multi-part process was developed to assess 
existing public engagement strategies and 
identify  ways  in  which  the  City  can  have 
more  effective  public  engagement.  The 
process included:

•  Preliminary research on City websites, 
social media pages, and organizational 
charts;

•  A questionnaire completed by 121 staff 

across 42 City departments and agencies;

•  Interviews with up to five representatives 
from 22 City departments and agencies; 

•  A three-hour workshop with 58 

participants representing 31 departments 
and agencies.

During  the  workshop,  City  staff  had  the 
chance to connect with one another, share

•  Extend the baseline assessment to 

more broadly involve community 
organizations, aldermen, and residents 
through surveys and focus groups, 
among other mechanisms;

•  Create a culture of public engagement 
by creating a shared vision at the City 
level and creating department- or 
agency-specific goals to execute the 
vision; 

•  Professionalize public engagement by 

providing a broad array of trainings 
to staff and developing formal 
mechanisms to share best practices 
across departments and agencies.

NEXT STEP
Establish  a  working  group  of  key  Mayor’s 
Office,  department,  and  agency  staff 
to  develop  a  working  plan  to  further 
prioritize  and  begin  implementing  initial 
recommendations. n

DESCRIPTION
Youth  unemployment  has  emerged  as  a 
key  issue  affecting  communities  across 
the  U.S.,  exacerbated  by  a  lack  of  career 
opportunities, particularly for those without 
a  four-year  degree.  The  City  has  taken  a 
cradle-to-career  approach  to  education 
that  ensures  all  students  have  pathways 
to  develop  meaningful  career  trajectories 
and  secure  their  economic  futures.  From 
expanding  early  childhood  education,  to 

providing  students  with  enrollment  and 
financial aid support, to aligning community 
college curricula with employer needs, the 
City  has  made  continual  investments  to 
ease  the  transition  of  students  from  pre-
kindergarten to career.

Codes  will  identify  and  recruit  untapped 
tech talent from underserved communities, 
create  a  well-trained,  diverse  pipeline  of 
programmers for local tech employers, and 
train between 50 and 100 residents in the 
first year. 

The  City  is  committed  to  unlocking  path-
ways  to  careers  in  fields  that  traditionally 
have  required  a  four-year  degree  for 
residents 
in  every  neighborhood.  This 
includes  an  emphasis  on  high-growth 
industries that have the potential to provide 
economic  opportunities  for  youth  from 
disadvantaged  backgrounds.  Within  CPS 
schools,  this  has  included  the  expansion 
of  Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and 
Mathematics  (STEM)  magnet  programs, 
Early  College  STEM  high  schools,  and 
Apple’s Everyone Can Code initiative. CCC 
and CCWP have also introduced new coding 
and  cyber  security  (Cyber)  bootcamps  at 
the post-secondary level. 

Government

residents

The  positive  impacts  of  these  efforts  are 
already taking form. The Apple and Cyber 
initiatives will be expanded to at least five 
bootcamps  in  2019,  with  an  expected  75 
percent  of  participating  students  set  to 
obtain  full-time  employment  within  nine 
months of course completion. Additionally, 
CCWP just recently announced the Chicago 
Codes  program,  a  tuition-free  technology 
development and coding academy. Chicago

DESCRIPTION
Launched  in  2015,  the  STAR  Scholarship 
program  allows  students  to  earn  their 
associate degree at City Colleges with no out-
of-pocket costs. CCC provides scholarships 
in the form of full tuition and book waivers 
to Chicago public high school students who 
graduate  with  a  B  average  or  above  and 
whose  test  scores  demonstrate  that  they 
are “completion ready.” A completion ready 
student  is  a  student  that,  with  additional 
developmental  education  coursework,  will 
be adequately prepared to earn an associate 

degree within three years of enrollment. The 
STAR Scholarship is available to all students 
that meet these criteria, regardless of their 
immigration status.

CCC  will  collaborate  with  CPS  to  notify 
students earlier in their high school careers 
about  the  STAR  Scholarship  opportunity. 
While  CPS  will  continue  to  alert  on-track 
seniors  of  the  opportunity,  it  will  begin 
notifying freshmen of the STAR Scholarship 
through e-mail and counselor outreach. CCC 
will also work to deepen the benefits of being 
a  STAR  Scholar  by  identifying  new  STAR 
Plus  Partners,  including  Historically  Black 
Colleges  and  Universities  (HBCUs).  STAR 
Plus Partners are local four-year universities 
that offer financial awards to STAR Scholars 
who  transfer  to  their  university  after 
obtaining  their  associate  degree  at  CCC. 
Currently,  CCC  does  not  have  any  HBCU 
STAR  Plus  Partners.  Expanding  the  CCC 
apprenticeship  program  to  include  HBCUs 
will  provide  more  opportunities  for  CCC 
STAR Scholars, in particular, Black or African 
American  students  seeking  expanded 
pathways to a postsecondary education.

Scholarship

②  Number of STAR Scholar students who 

graduate from CCC within three years

institution

④  Number of STAR Plus Partner 

institutions, including new HBCU 
partners

EQUITY IMPACTS
Students enrolled in CPS schools that face 
financial and social barriers to accessing 
postsecondary education. Of the 4,004 
current STAR Scholars, 80 percent are 
first generation college students, 68 
percent are Hispanic or Latino, and 17 
percent are Black or African American.

DESCRIPTION
The  City  will  develop  the  Youth  Quality 
of  Life  (YQL)  index  and  scorecard  with 
City  departments,  sister  agencies,  and 
external  partners  to  measure  the  impact 
of government investments on the lives of 
Chicago youth over time. Since 2011, the City 
has more than tripled its spending on youth 
programs, from $21 million to $75 million in 
the 2019 City budget. The City will analyze 

•  Chicago youth have healthy relationships 

Government
connected to

residents

with themselves and others; and

•  Chicago youth are physically healthy and 
have access to resources to maintain their 
health.

The  YQL  index  and  scorecard  will  enable 
the City to track these essential outcomes 
and make strategic investments to improve 
Chicago youth’s ability to participate in the 
economic  future  of  the  city,  regardless  of 
socioeconomic background.

NEXT STEP
The City will work with partners to develop, 
maintain, and analyze the YQL index and

families  that  will  help  prevent  negative 
health  outcomes,  reduce  risk  to  families 
and  infants,  connect  families  to  needed 
supports,  and  improve  community  well-
being.

To advance this concept, CDPH conducted 
a  six-month  research  and  community 
engagement  process,  interviewing  and 
speaking  with  over  160  representatives 
from  provider,  hospital,  managed  care, 
government, and research/policy sectors. 

This comprehensive effort surfaced:

•  A  clear  need  for  a  universal  system 
to  overcome  the  stigma  of  social 
services, reach isolated, at-risk, and in-
risk  families,  to  better  understand  and 
address  health-related  disparities,  and 
to connect families to services to meet 
needs that are a mismatch with current 
eligibility constraints;

•  A 

resounding  call 

for  a  better 
coordinated system in which gaps can 
be  understood  and  addressed,  and 
through  which 
families  experience 
a  seamless  process  to  connect  with 
needed supports;

•  A  strong  evidence  base  for  the  ways 
to  improve  maternal  and  infant  health 
outcomes, as well as seed early learning

and  enhanced  parenting  skills  among 
families;

•  Support for moving beyond the current 
focus on at-risk infants to a more holistic 
focus  on  the  entire  family,  including 
maternal  mental  and  physical  health; 
and

•  Strong  urging  to  concurrently  address 
social  determinants  of  health,  such 
as  safety,  social  cohesion,  housing 
and  economic  status,  early  care  and 
education, and transportation access.

CDPH  has  identified  a  promising  model 
to deliver coordinated, universal referrals 
for  newborns  and  their  families  across 
all  40,000  births  annually  in  Chicago. 
Duke  Family  Connects  International  is 
a  comprehensive  referral  system  that 
works  closely  with  birthing  hospitals  to 
reach all families, including those who are 
isolated and/or at risk.

As part of this approach, registered nurses 
visit families within five weeks of birth to 
conduct follow-up medical screening and 
related assessments across the domains 
of  health  care,  child  care,  financial, 
social,  mental  health,  home  safety,  and

one  to  three  visits  based  on  family  risk

hand-off  to  appropriate  supports  and 
interventions.  These  may  include,  but 
are  not  limited  to,  home  visiting,  child 
care, health care, food access, and social 
service supports.

The  model  is  grounded  in  a  strong 
evidence  base, 
including  association 
with  greater  social  capital/community 
connections,  higher  quality  child  care 
usage, higher quality parenting behaviors, 
higher quality home environment, better 
maternal  mental  health,  and  reduced 
emergency  medical  care  for  infants.  A 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed 
85  percent  fewer  hospital  overnights  at 
12  months  postpartum  and  37  percent 
less  infant  emergency  medical  care  at 
24  months  postpartum,  as  well  as  39

understand  how  the  model  must  be 
adapted  for  Chicago’s  context  –  after 
which  the  referral  system  will  be  scaled

RESILIENT CHICAGOBACKGROUND: 
FIVE-YEAR HOUSING PLAN

community-based 

Every  five  years,  a  diverse  set  of 
housing  experts,  activists,  developers, 
and 
organizations 
partner  with  City  departments  to  outline 
a  coordinated  strategy  to  develop  and 
preserve  affordable  housing  across  the 
city. The Five-Year Housing Plan establishes 
the  City’s  guiding  vision  for  housing  and 
outlines  the  strategies  and  investments 
necessary  to  ensure  all  Chicagoans  can 
find a place to live, work, and ultimately call 
home. 

In  February  2014,  the  City  released  its 
previous Five-Year Housing Plan, Bouncing 

in  June  2018  and  focuses  on  supporting 
access to housing as a core component of 
all neighborhood planning. Over 140 leaders 
in  government,  academics,  community 
agencies,  and  housing  developers  have 
been engaged through the plan’s steering 
and  advisory  committees  to  identify  the 
key issues, establish priorities, and outline 
the  strategies  and  investments  that  will 
guide the City’s housing strategy from 2019 
to  2023.  The  priorities  include  expanding 
affordable  housing  options,  promoting 
homeownership, tackling emerging threats 
of  gentrification  and  displacement,  and 
addressing chronic homelessness.

Through  the  plan,  the  City  will  further 
its  commitment  to  investing  actively  in 
affordable housing and integrating housing 
within  a  coordinated  strategy  to  build 
strong neighborhoods. A preview of select 
actions included in the Five-Year Housing 
Plan follows.

Back, which focused efforts on responses 
to  the  housing  recession  to  support  the 
stability  of  Chicago’s  housing  market. 
Over  the  past 
few  years,  Chicago’s 
housing  recession  has  ended  in  most 
portions of the City, yet other areas remain 
distressed.  Costs  to  develop  affordable 
housing  continue  to  rise,  while  resources 
and  leadership  at  the  federal  level  are 
diminishing. 

Now more than ever, the City’s approach 
cannot be one size fits all, and housing as 
an issue in Chicago warrants an elevated 
profile  and 
leadership.  To  meet  this 
challenge,  Mayor  Emanuel  has  called  for 
the  Chicago  Department  of  Housing  to 
be  exclusively  focused  on  supporting 
access to housing as a core component of 
all  neighborhoods.  The  new  department 
will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the 
strategy  outlined  in  the  next  Five-Year 
Housing Plan. The Mayor has called on the 
plan’s  steering  and  advisory  committees 
to create a new and transformative vision 
for housing, and the new department will 
reflect that vision.

The  planning  process  for  the  City’s 
updated  Five-Year  Housing  Plan  began

DESCRIPTION
Growing  demand  for  housing  in  many 
Chicago  neighborhoods  has 
spurred 
the  pace  of  development  and  raised  the 
value  of  homes  in  these  areas.  While  the 
transformation  of  communities  such  as 
Logan  Square,  West  Town,  and  Pilsen 
has  brought  about  new  neighborhood 
amenities  and  increased  local  economic 
activity, subsequent rises in property values 
have burdened existing low- and moderate-
income 
them  at 
heightened risk of displacement from their 
communities. This risk exacerbates historic 

residents  and  put 

In  response,  the  City  has  begun  to 
pilot  measures  under 
the  Affordable 
Requirements Ordinance (ARO) to expand 
affordable  housing  options  in  targeted 
communities.  Two  pilot  areas,  along  the 
Milwaukee  corridor  adjacent  to  the  CTA’s 
Blue Line and in the Near North and Near 
West  neighborhoods,  were  approved 
by  City  Council  in  2017.  The  ordinance 
eliminates the option for developers to pay 
a fee to the City in lieu of building affordable 
units  and  requires  a  higher  proportion  of 
units developed - between 15 to 20 percent 
- be retained at affordable rates, depending 
on  the  project’s  location.  A  third  pilot 
launched  in  December  2018  in  the  Pilsen 
and Little Village neighborhoods raises the 
required proportion of affordable units to be 
provided and directs developer in lieu fees 
toward  affordable  housing  preservation 
programs  for  multi-family  buildings  and 
income-qualified homeowners.

This initiative will help protect economically 
vulnerable  residents  from  the  risk  of 
displacement  that  can  accompany  shifts 
in  community  demographics  and  local 
housing markets. Under the pilot program,

NEXT STEP
Implement pilot program, track successes, 
and develop approaches for expansion to 
other Chicago neighborhoods at risk of, or 
currently experiencing, long-term resident 
displacement. n

POTENTIAL KEY INDICATORS
①  Change in median household income in 

pilot areas

②  Number of affordable units created in 

pilot areas, including CHA units
③  Reversal of homeownership rate 

declines in pilot areas

EQUITY IMPACTS
Low to moderate income residents at risk 
of displacement or with limited affordable 
housing options, particularly along the 
Milwaukee corridor adjacent to the CTA’s 
Blue Line, and in the Near North and Near 
West neighborhoods.

The fund will be used to provide low-cost 
financing to developers that seek to buy 
existing multifamily buildings in high-cost 
and gentrifying neighborhoods. To qualify, 
developers must keep at least 20 percent 
of  units  affordable  to  households  at  or 
below 50 percent of area median income 
for  15  years  after  building  purchase.  The 
fund will have below-market interest rates 
to incentivize uptake by developers.

In

developing 
neighborhoods  where  housing  demand 
and property values continue to increase, 
private 
rental 
units  have  little  incentive  to  offer  their 
properties  at 
traditionally  affordable 
rents.  To  ensure  affordable  choices  in 
these  neighborhoods  –  especially  for 
families  that  can  be  priced  into  lower 
markets  –  the  City  is  investing  alongside 
banks, foundations, and other government 
agencies  to  create  the  Opportunity 
Investment  Fund,  which  will  be  used  to 
preserve affordable housing stock.

DESCRIPTION
Homeownership  contributes  to  wealth 
creation and is a positive step in building 
equity  for  many  Chicagoans.  Preserving 
affordable  paths  to  homeownership  is 
important  for  residents 
in  historically 
disinvested  communities  that  are  begin-
ning  to  experience  climbing  property 
values  due  to  increased  investment  and 
ongoing  housing  market  recovery.  To 
ensure  that  residents  can  live  affordably 
in  their  neighborhoods,  the  City  has 
established  the  Building  Neighborhoods 
and  Affordable  Homes  (BNAH)  pilot 
program. BNAH connects eligible residents 

with  assistance  to  purchase  homes  built 
through the City Lots for Working Families 
program,  which  provides  vacant,  City-
owned  lots  to  developers  of  affordable 
single-family homes for $1 each.

The BNAH pilot program incentivizes the 
development  of,  and  provides  access  to, 
100 new homes to be built in Englewood, 
Lawndale,  Little  Village,  Humboldt  Park, 
Garfield  Park,  and  Woodlawn.  The  City 
has  already  committed  to  making  major 
investments  in  schools,  parks,  housing 
and  business  development 
in  these 
areas, and the pilot is designed to create 
affordable  homeownership  opportunities 
for residents to share in the future benefits 
of these investments.

The $5 million pilot program is funded by 
the City’s Affordable Housing Opportunity 
Fund, which receives fees from developers 
subject  to  the  Affordable  Requirements 
Ordinance.  Purchase  price  assistance 
–  ranging  from  $40,000  to  $60,000  – 
is  available  for  qualifying  residents  to 
purchase an eligible home for use as their 
primary residence for at least 10 years. 

NEXT STEP
Implement pilot program, track successes, 
and develop approaches for expansion to 
other Chicago neighborhoods to ensure 
residents can share in neighborhood 
development. n

These initial bus corridors also strategically

Zones, a targeted initiative to support small 
businesses and develop commercial activity 
on neighborhood business corridors.

As part of the ordinance, the City will publish 
an Equitable Transit Oriented Development 
Policy Plan that assesses the policy’s impact 
and  recommends  any  revisions  that  may 
be  necessary  to  address  potential  issues 
involving  gentrification,  congestion,  transit 
investment needs and other issues, as well 
as  opportunities  to  further  enhance  its 
goals.

DESCRIPTION
(TOD) 
Transit-oriented  development 
policies 
incentivize  development  near 
existing  transit  assets,  encourage  lower 
carbon 
transportation  choices,  and 
reduce  household  costs  associated  with 
car  ownership.  Chicago’s  TOD  policy 
increases  density  and  reduces  minimum 
parking  requirements  compared  to  the 
base  zoning  for  new  developments  near 
the  City’s  existing  CTA  and  Metra  rail 
assets.  More  than  144  developments,

24,419 
residential  units,  have  directly  benefited

While  the  majority  of  the  City’s  TOD 
policies  have  focused  on  rail  stations 
and  individual  bus  projects,  Chicago  has 
numerous  bus  routes  that  experience 
ridership that meets or exceeds sections of 
the Blue, Orange, Green, and Pink lines. In 
2019, the City expanded its TOD policy to 
high ridership, high frequency bus routes 
to  encourage  affordability  and  connect 
neighborhoods. Initially focusing on buses 
serving Western Avenue, Ashland Avenue, 
Chicago  Avenue,  79th  Street,  and  other 
priority  corridors,  the  new  policy  will 
address:

•  Incentives  to  support  affordability  and

ORGANIZATION MISSION 
The  Garfield  Park  Community  Council 
(GPCC) 
community-building 
organization  that  consists  of  dedicated 
residents  and  allies  working  together  to 
develop  leaders  and  create  opportunities 
that  build  a 
thriving  Garfield  Park 
community.  The  GPCC  was  created  in 
2005  by  LISC  Chicago  and  the  Garfield 
Park  Conservatory  Alliance  as  a  result 
of  a  Quality  of  Life  Plan  for  East  Garfield 
Park  designed  by  more 
than  400 
community  residents  and  stakeholders. 
The  GPCC  became  an 
independent, 
501(c)3  organization  in  2012,  and  focuses 
on  four  resident-defined  priority  areas: 
wellness,  housing,  commercial  corridor 
development, and resident organizing.

WHO WE SERVE
GPCC serves the Garfield Park Community, 
a  neighborhood  poised  for  change  with 
considerable  assets.  The  community  has 
accessible  and  multiple  transportation 
options,  proximity  to  Chicago’s  Loop, 
high  quality  housing  stock,  and  strong 

such  as  constructing  rain  gardens,  trees, 
and permeable pavement on a vacant, City-
owned parcel. The project also involves a 
Community Eco-Orchard, an outgrowth of 
GPCC’s Neighborhood Market. The orchard 
will be designed in the style of a food forest, 
mimicking a woodland ecosystem that can 
be  managed  by  a  committed  group  of 
residents and students, while focusing on 
types  of  fruit  that  grow  well  in  Chicago. 
The Eco-Orchard will improve community 
wellness  by 
increasing  the  availability 
of 
fresh  produce,  supporting  service 
learning opportunities for local teens, and 
beautifying many previously blighted areas 
of the neighborhood.

institutions.  As  a  diverse 
community 
of 
stakeholders,  GPCC 
community 
envisions that East and West Garfield Park 
will become an attractive, healthy, vibrant, 
family-friendly community whose residents 
are  empowered  and  fully  engaged  in  its 
sustainability.

GPCC’S WORK IN ACTION
The  Garfield  Park  Resilience  Corridor  will 
be developed along Fifth Avenue, between 
Sacramento Boulevard and Kedzie Avenue. 
The  Resilience  Corridor  will  address 
intersecting health and sustainability needs 
in Garfield Park. The community has fewer 
retail  options  that  sell  fresh  produce  and 
other healthy food, and residents contend 
with  high  levels  of  violence  and  poverty 
which  can  make  residents  less  likely  to 
leave  their  homes  to  purchase  healthy 
foods  or  engage  in  outdoor  physical 
activities  out  of  concern  for  their  safety. 
The  Resilience  Corridor  mitigates  these 
challenges  by  constructing  a  stormwater 
landscape  and  a  fruit  orchard  along  Fifth 
Avenue. The project will divert and direct 
stormwater  from  surrounding  streets  and 
alleys  into  green  infrastructure  strategies

RESILIENT CHICAGOSECTION 4: ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE

PILLAR 2: ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE

Like many large cities, Chicago relies on an 
aging infrastructure for many of its critical 
services.  Nearly  one  quarter  of  Chicago’s 
water mains are more than 100 years old, and 
the majority of its bridges were built before 
1950.  Despite  ongoing  City  investments 
and the rapid emergence of new mobility 
providers,  inequities  in  access  to  transit 
and transportation options persist. As the 
effects of climate change are realized, the 
City’s  infrastructure  investments  must  be 
made with extreme weather events – such 
as  floods,  heat  waves,  and  blizzards  –  in 
mind.

A  more  connected  Chicago  is  rooted 
in  a  robust  infrastructure  network  that 
simultaneously meets the current needs of 
residents, addresses emerging threats, and 
anticipates future opportunities.

“Building  a  New  Chicago”  initiative  has 
bolstered  park,  water, 
transportation, 
and  school 
infrastructure,  while  CTA 
enhancements  such  as  the  Red  &  Purple

the  new  Damen  Green  Line  station  will 
improve  service  and  reliability  for  transit

Finally,  Chicago  will  remain  a  leader  in 
addressing the existential threat of climate 
change.  Whether  through  the  Chicago 
Climate Charter, a compact signed by over 
70  Mayors  to  reduce  their  local  carbon 
emissions  to  target 
levels  previously 
established under the Paris Agreement, or 
through  the  City’s  commitment  to  power 
all  public  buildings  using  100  percent 
renewable  energy  by  2025,  Chicago  is 
taking action now to protect the security 
and prosperity of generations to come.

This strategy section defines specific goals 
and actions to ensure that all Chicagoans 
benefit  from  the  provision  of  robust 
infrastructure  –  by  connecting  the  city’s 
most  vulnerable  residents  to  economic 
opportunities  and  a  better  quality  of  life 
overall.

in  2018,  Chicago’s  O’Hare  International 
Airport  was  named  the  best-connected 
airport in the nation, outpacing other major 
hubs on the 2018 Megahubs U.S. Index.

Looking forward, the City will continue to 
examine  where  infrastructure  investments 
are  most  needed  and  how  to  plan  and 
coordinate  these  investments  to  ensure 
maximum impact. By making investments 
that  strategically  address  multiple  needs 
at  once,  the  City  can  empower  residents 
and  communities  that  have  suffered 
limited 
from  historic  disinvestment, 
opportunities,  and  other  barriers 
to 
socioeconomic mobility.

For  example,  new  transportation  and 
mobility  options  can  be  prioritized  in 
neighborhoods  traditionally  disconnected 
from areas of economic prosperity, thereby 
supporting  access  to  jobs  and  workforce 
development  opportunities.  Additional 
investments  in  green  infrastructure  can 
reduce the risk of flooding, while promoting 
healthier, more sustainable neighborhoods. 
These  types  of  smart  resource  allocation 
decisions  can  have  a  lasting  and  positive 
effect  on  Chicago’s  most  vulnerable 
residents, building the city’s urban resilience 
in turn.

Strategic  investments  in  infrastructure  are  crucial 
to  the  City’s  ability  to  meet  community  needs.  By 
enhancing  its  planning  and  coordination  efforts,  the 
City  can  minimize  disruptions,  realize  cost  savings, 
and prolong the life cycle of its infrastructure assets.

DESCRIPTION
The  City,  under  the  leadership  of  CDOT’s 
Division  of 
Infrastructure  Management 
(DOIM),  has  made  substantial  progress 
over  the  last  five  years  in  increasing  the 
coordination of infrastructure investments 
in the public right-of-way. Since 2012, the 
City  has  saved  $140  million  in  duplicative 
work through a reduction in repetitive street 
cuts  and  restoration  needs.  This  effective 
coordination is aided by visualization tools, 
such  as  DotMaps,  which  maps  planned 
infrastructure 
investments  and  flags 
conflicts. These tools increase the efficiency 
of DOIM to track and resolve construction 
conflicts  among  departments,  agencies, 

stored  and  coordinated  using  DotMaps, 
this  effort  will  start  by  inventorying  the 
existing  data  in  the  DotMaps  tool,  select 
useful additions to the tool such as Vision 
Zero corridors, DPD projects (e.g. industrial 
corridors  of  focus,  ongoing  planning 
studies), and other initiatives, identify pilot 
study areas where multiple initiatives and 
planned  infrastructure  projects  overlap, 
quantify the co-benefits of a hypothetical 
coordination between multiple parties, and 
summarize  the  potential  for  coordination 
on  a  larger  scale.  From  this  research, 
the  City  will  identify  the  most  promising 
opportunities  to 
improve  coordination, 
including  potential  platforms,  and  design 
applicable pilots to test new ideas.

NEXT STEPS

and  companies  within  the  right-of-way. 
The City can potentially realize additional 
benefits  by  expanding  the  use  of  tools 
like  DotMaps  and  overlaying  additional 
data  sets  for  proactive  collaboration  and 
planning.

Specifically,  the  City,  its  partners,  and 
infrastructure  organizations  can  realize 
cost  savings,  shorten  construction  times 
and  frequency,  and  limit  disruption  while 
also  advancing  city-wide  goals  through 
improved  coordination.  For  example,  the 
City has identified priority corridors for the 
Vision Zero initiative, in a concerted effort 
to  eliminate  traffic  fatalities  and  serious 
injuries by 2026. By overlaying Vision Zero 
corridors  with  the  capital  improvement 
plans  of  different  infrastructure  agencies 
and  organizations,  opportunities 
to 
improve  safety  along  these  routes  during 
other in-the-road construction projects can 
be identified and affirmatively pursued.

To  better  understand  the  full  potential 
of  improved  coordination,  the  City  will 
conduct  a  research  project  to  determine 
how  the  proactive  planning  tools  can 
be  leveraged  to  realize  community  co-
benefits, complement other City initiatives, 
and achieve City priorities. This analysis will 
explore the general value of using tools for 
broader  planning  coordination  by  using 
the  existing  DotMaps  as  an  example  of 
such  a  platform.  Since  the  City’s  data  is

A  more  connected  Chicago  requires 
effective  partnerships  to  build  urban 
resilience. To this end, the City of Chicago 
has  developed  a  first-of-its-kind  City-
utility  partnership  with  Commonwealth 
Edison (ComEd) to position Chicago as a 
global resilience leader.

to 

In early 2018, the CRO began discussions 
with  ComEd 
identify  potential 
opportunities for enhanced collaboration. 
A series of working sessions were held in 
summer  2018  to  dive  deeper  into  areas 
of opportunity, focusing on three themes: 

1.   Distributed Energy Resources and   
    Resilience
2. Partners in Building Resilience
3.  Income-Eligible Energy Efficiency 

Programs

DISTRIBUTED ENERGY 
RESOURCES AND RESILIENCE
PARTNERS
ComEd, CDOT, 2FM, OEMC, Mayor’s Office

As  part  of  its  Community  of  the  Future 
initiative, ComEd is investing in distributed 
energy  resources  (DER),  such  as  rooftop 
solar  panels  and  battery  storage  as  part 
of a microgrid, to provide electricity to its 
Bronzeville  Community  Microgrid  (BCM). 
A microgrid is a small power grid that can 
operate independently from the main grid 
if  needed  and  draws  upon  DER  to  keep 
power flowing in the case of a power failure.

When  complete,  the  BCM  will  support 
critical  community  services.  The  City 
currently  operates  several  DER  assets  at 
municipal facilities throughout Chicago and 
has committed to expanding the use of DER, 
including solar panels and electric vehicles. 
The  City  and  ComEd  will  collaborate  to 
select  up  to  five  sites  of  future  DER  to 
reduce  carbon  emissions,  enhance  grid 
and community resilience, and support the 
emergence of a smart city.

7 8

The  City  and  ComEd  will  identify  how 
existing  City-distributed  energy  resources 
can  be  connected  to  the  BCM,  how 
microgrids can protect critical City facilities, 
and  where  new,  low-carbon  DER  assets 
should be installed. To accomplish this, the 
City and ComEd: 

1.  Submitted  an  application  in  July  2018 
to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  for  a 
grant  to  support  a  joint  pilot  of  electric 
vehicle  charging  infrastructure  for  multi-
unit  residential  buildings  in  Bronzeville.  If 
awarded, the pilot will launch in early 2019.

2.  Will formalize a plan by early 2019 for the 
joint-siting  of  electric  vehicle  charging 
stations and other DER in and around the 
Bronzeville Community Microgrid.

COMED’S COMMUNITY OF 
THE FUTURE
ComEd  has  been  actively  exploring  the 
role  of  utilities  in  improving  the  resilience 
of  residents,  communities,  and  cities. 
Through  its  Community  of  the  Future 
initiative  in  Bronzeville,  ComEd  has  been 
collaborating  with  community  members 
to create a “smart community” – one that 
is connected, sustainable, and resilient – by 
identifying opportunities to leverage smart 
grid  technologies  and  related  services  to 
enhance the daily lives of residents.

RESILIENCE 
PARTNERS 
ComEd, Elevated Chicago, CDPH, CDOT, 
CTA, Mayor’s Office

The  City  and  ComEd  are  engaging  key 
partners  such  as  Elevated  Chicago  to 
promote  public  health 
in  Chicago’s 
neighborhoods.  By  creating  a  dedicated 
forum  for  the  sharing  of  information  and 
resources,  the  City,  ComEd,  and  Elevated 
Chicago  will 
identify  areas  of  mutual 
interest with an eye toward identifying new 
opportunities  for  collaboration,  including 
the implementation of innovative programs, 
tracking  of  key  resilience  metrics,  and 
sharing of data, outcomes, and learnings.

ELEVATED CHICAGO
Elevated  Chicago  aims  to  promote  racial 
equity, prosperity, and resilience in Chicago 
communities  by  using  Equitable  Transit-
Oriented  Development  (eTOD)  as  the 
catalyst  for  change.  Elevated  Chicago 
has  selected  strategic  locations  along  the 
Green,  Pink,  and  Blue  lines  to  implement 
place-based initiatives. Two of the locations 
along the Green Line South at the 51st and 
Garfield stations are within the boundaries 
of ComEd’s Community of the Future work. 

Over the next year, the partnership will:
1.  Compare parties’ existing resilience 

metrics, indicators, and data to streamline 
collection and analysis, including the use 
of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors

2.  Develop a pilot in the Bronzeville 

community for minibus routes

3.  Determine opportunities to support the 
electrification of the City’s transit system

INCOME-ELIGIBLE ENERGY 
EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS
PARTNERS 
ComEd, CDPH, DFSS, Mayor’s Office 
Research  has  shown  that 
low-income 
households, households of color, and renting 
households spend a disproportionately large 
portion of income on energy bills, revealing 
the value that energy efficiency programs 
offer. A reduction in household energy costs 
can lower housing cost burden and increase 
affordability, enabling residents to remain in 
their homes and use their income on other 
essential expenses, an approach detailed in 
CDPH’s Healthy Chicago 2.0 Plan.

The  City  and  ComEd  will  partner  to 
reduce  housing  cost  burden  and  promote 
affordability for residents. Both entities will 
collaborate  to  identify  new  approaches 
to  promote  ComEd’s  suite  of  energy 
efficiency 
low-income 
households, to reduce barriers to accessing 
energy  efficiency  opportunities  for  these 
often  disconnected  and  hard-to-reach 
communities.  The  efforts  will  include  a 
targeted  deployment  in  Bronzeville  and 
expand to other communities.

Over the next year, the City and ComEd will:

1.    Distribute information on income-eligible 

energy efficiency programs through 
City channels, e.g. WIC clinics, lead 
inspections, CDPH’s nurse home visiting 
program, and Community Service 
Centers.

2.  Improve multi-family outreach by 

leveraging the City’s benchmarking 
ordinance data to target high energy 
usage properties.

3.  Explore additional opportunities 
to improve outreach and engage 
disconnected and underserved 
populations.

INCREASE INVESTMENT IN 
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TO 
REDUCE FLOOD RISK AND 
CREATE MORE SUSTAINABLE 
NEIGHBORHOODS

As  cities  grapple  with  a  changing  climate  and  the 
potential  for  more  extreme  weather  events,  smart 
approaches  to  stormwater  management  are  needed 
to address flood risk. This goal shows how investments 
in  green  infrastructure,  enhancements  in  systems

DESCRIPTION
The  City  of  Chicago  was  the  first  major 
metropolitan  area 
in  the  country  to 
successfully  implement  an  inlet  control 
system  to  relieve  basement  flooding.  The 
system  works  by 
installing  restrictors 
to  slow  the  flow  of  stormwater  into  the 
sewer  system.  As  a  result,  stormwater  is 
detained  on  city  streets  for  brief  periods 
of time before being allowed to flow back 
into the sewer system. This measure helps 
relieve the burden on the sewer system and 
reduce the frequency of basement flooding 
and combined sewer overflows (CSO) into 
waterways. 

However,  the  City-operated  inlet  control 
system  is  not  a  cure-all.  In  times  of  heavy 
rainfall,  water  that  is  directed  into  the 
sewer  system  by  residential  downspouts 
can  cause  the  system  to  reach  capacity, 
increasing  the  risk  for  basement  backups 
and CSOs. As a result, the City will continue 
to  encourage  homeowners  to  disconnect 
their  downspouts  from  the  sewer  system 
and instead divert rainwater to their yards, 
gardens,  or  other  green  spaces.  This 
approach can be used in conjunction with 
rain barrels or cisterns to temporarily store 
runoff  water,  which  can  in  turn  be  used 
to  irrigate  lawns  and  landscaped  areas  in 
between rainfall events. While impractical in 
areas where there are only hard surfaces or 
where  drainage  could  impact  neighboring 
properties, the potential to reduce basement 
flooding  and  increase  natural  infiltration  is 
promising.
The  City  will  carry  out  its  community 
outreach  campaign  using  public  service 
announcements 
community 
meetings. 
tapes, 
brochures,  and  discounts  on  materials  for 
downspout disconnection are available for 
homeowners,  and  the  City  will  expand  its 
efforts to educate residents on the benefits 
of disconnecting existing downspouts and 
on alternative uses of stormwater.

DISCONNECT YOUR DOWNSPOUT 
TODAY TO PREVENT BASEMENT 
FLOODING AND SEWAGE OVERFLOW
When you disconnect your downspout, be 
sure to direct the water to your yard, garden, 
or other green space. Remember that cold 
weather  will  cause  icing  conditions.  When 
completed, your project will be a permanent 
solution  beneficial  to  your  grass,  flowers, 
shrubbery and trees.

DESCRIPTION
First  created  in  2014,  the  City’s  Green 
Stormwater  Infrastructure  Strategy  was 
designed 
to  minimize  flood  damage 
caused  by  excess  stormwater  while 
realizing a number of co-benefits of green 
infrastructure 
including  air 
and  water  quality  improvements,  urban 
heat  island  mitigation,  greenhouse  gas 
(GHG)  reduction,  and  improved  livability 
conditions  due  to  increased  access  to 
green  spaces.  Flooding  is  an  increasingly 
important issue for Chicago residents as it 
can cause significant property damage with 
more  severe  and  frequent  storm  events, 

investments 

particularly in flood-prone communities on 
the South and West Sides of the city.

With this action, the City will fully implement 
the  original  Green  Infrastructure  Strategy 
and develop a new, forward-looking Green 
Stormwater 
Infrastructure  Strategy  2.0. 
Updates  to  the  strategy  will  include  more 
detailed modeling to better convey impact 
and  a  detailed  analysis  of  how  green 
stormwater  projects  will  be  implemented 
over time. Additionally, changes to the City’s 
Stormwater  Ordinance  will  be  explored  to 
further  address  the  impact  of  stormwater 
flows on Chicago’s combined sewer system.

RESILIENT CHICAGOCASE STUDY 

Resilient Corridor 
Project    

OVERVIEW
A  severe  rainstorm  in  2013  caused  2,500 
“water  in  basement”  and  800  “water  on 
street”  complaints,  damages  to  and  shut 
downs of businesses, and flooding at train 
stations and bus stops across the city. The 
widespread impact of this event prompted 
the  Mayor’s  Office  and  City  planning, 
water  management, 
transportation, 
and  emergency  management  entities 
to  prioritize  strategies  to  reduce  future 
stormwater  impacts  during  peak  storm 
events.

As a result of this collaboration, the City was 
awarded funds from the Housing and Urban

has been used to fund the implementation 
of

landscapes 
(green infrastructure) on City-owned vacant 
lots in flood-affected neighborhoods. With 
the  support  of  the  Mayor’s  Office,  DPD 
created  a  visionary,  efficient,  technically 
rigorous and inclusive community process, 
eventually  selecting  ten  sites  on  three 
transitional commercial corridors (Chicago 
Avenue, 16th Street, and Ogden Avenue) on 
Chicago’s  West  Side,  which  was  selected 
as  an  implementation  area  because  it  is

This project turned publicly-owned parcels 
into  vibrant  open  spaces  that  provide  a 
dual  benefit  to  the  areas  they  serve  by 
combining 
infrastructure  enhancement 
and  neighborhood 
through 
public  space  activation  and  community 
partnership. Starting in fall 2018, the City has 
been leveraging the success of this program 
to  partner  with  the  regional  Metropolitan 
Water  Reclamation  District  (MWRD)  and 
apply  a  similar  planning  process  to  a  new 
Resilient  Corridor,  a  community-led  urban 
orchard in Garfield Park.

to diverse populations. 

Planning and design began in March 2017 
and included a range of green infrastructure 
strategies  such  as  permeable  pavements 
and  rain  gardens  that  accept  stormwater 
from  streets,  alleys  and  adjacent  prop-
erties.  Rigorous  community  engagement 
generated  the  programming  for  each 
site,  which 
includes  passive  gardens, 
active recreation areas, and public plazas. 
Construction  was  completed  in  fall  2018, 
and stewards such as the Chicago Botanic 
Garden, YMCA, and a local business owner 
are expected to sign agreements with the 
City to lease the constructed parcels and 
maintain  the  specialized  landscapes  for 
the  lease  duration.  Green  infrastructure

DESCRIPTION
Basement  flooding  impacts  thousands  of 
Chicago  households  during  severe  rain 
events. Although widespread, the effects of 
basement  flooding  are  disproportionately 
experienced  by  Chicago’s  most  vulnerable 
residents,  especially  those  living  in  flood-
prone communities and who may lack flood 
insurance  or  the  financial  resources  to  pay 
for post-storm repairs.

Chicago  can  strategically  invest  in  green 
infrastructure  to  address  the  devastating 

livability.  While 

effects  of  unexpected  flooding,  promote 
neighborhood  development,  and  improve 
community 
green 
infrastructure already exists on public streets, 
buildings,  and  previously  vacant  lands,  the 
opportunity remains for the City of Chicago 
to better coordinate its efforts to plan, fund, 
and measure the performance of these types 
of investments.

This 
initiative  will  enable  broad-based 
coordination  across  City  departments, 
agencies,  and  key  partners  to  develop 
green  infrastructure  interventions  uniquely 
tailored to the requirements of flood-prone 
properties across Chicago. The City and its 
partners  will  determine  planning  criteria 
for  project  selection  (e.g.  area  flood  risk, 
vulnerable  populations,  strong  community 
stewards)  and  identify  dedicated  funding 
streams  to  support  these  investments  and 
augment  the  overall  green  infrastructure 
footprint  across  the  city.  The  City  will  also 
work  with  local  community  groups  and 
regional partners such as MWRD to address 
ongoing maintenance needs.

Government

residents

To  determine  the  feasibility  and  scalability 
of  this  approach,  the  City  will  conduct 
a  pilot  study  to  explore  potential  green 
infrastructure solutions at four priority sites 
in the Austin, Auburn Gresham, Englewood, 
and Calumet Heights community areas.

COMMUNITY AND PROJECT 
SELECTION METHODOLOGY
To  identify  potential  locations  for  the  pilot 

8 8

study,  a  reductive  screening  process  was 
performed for the entire geographic area of 
the city, using the following tools:

  1)  Desktop GIS Overlay and Area 

Prioritization

  2) Existing Green Infrastructure Evaluation
  3) Site Visits
  4) Detailed Hydraulic Modeling 

1) DESKTOP GIS OVERLAY  
    AND AREA PRIORITIZATION

Key  datasets  were  mapped  and  analyzed 
to  determine  community  areas  with  the 
greatest need for the implementation of new 
stormwater management measures. Existing 
City data for basement flood risk, 311 call data 
regarding water in basement or on street, and 
planned DWM Capital Improvement Projects 
(CIP) was used to identify 18 potential pilot 
areas  for  intervention.  Additional  analysis 
was  conducted  to  characterize  each  area 
across  several  factors,  including  land  use, 
vacant lots, ownership, space requirements, 
and proximity to parks and schools.

Potential pilot areas were then prioritized 
based on additional considerations:
•  Results of related work previously 

completed in each area;

•  Amount of publicly owned land in each 

area (i.e. number of schools, number 
of parks, and area of City-owned 

RESILIENT CHICAGOvacant land), as a proxy for ease of 
implementation; and

• Geographic diversity of the areas.

From  this  analysis,  five  potential  pilot 
areas  and  three  to  five  green  infrastructure 
project opportunities within each area were 
identified for further exploration. Each project 
underwent a review based on a preliminary 
stormwater  analysis,  design  opportunity, 
potential  community  and  funding  partners, 
among  other  criteria.  Ultimately,  eight 
projects  in  the  Austin,  Auburn  Gresham, 
Englewood, and Calumet Heights community 
areas were selected for additional evaluation.
2) EXISTING GREEN  
    INFRASTRUCTURE EVALUATION
Green infrastructure projects and programs 
in  Chicago  and  other  major  cities  were 
evaluated  for  any  demonstrated  successes. 
Locally, examples of effective projects have 
included permeable pavement, rain gardens 
and bioswales on school grounds, parkways, 
alleys, and vacant land. 
3) SITE VISITS
Eight site visits were conducted to create final 
recommendations.  From  these  visits,  and 
based  on  preliminary  green  infrastructure 
strategies  under  consideration,  four  project 
sites were selected spanning four community 
areas:

Austin:  N Central Ave between W Augusta 
Blvd and W Iowa St; CPS Brunson Specialty 
School
Calumet  Heights:  93rd  Street  between  S 
Colfax Ave and S Yates Blvd; residential

Auburn  Gresham/Englewood:  Laflin  St 
between 76th St and 77th St; residential
Auburn Gresham/Englewood: 76th St and 
S  Racine  Ave;  Anchor  House  affordable 
housing; CPL Thurgood Marshall Branch 

4) DETAILED HYDRAULIC MODELING 
Before  finalizing  the  design  of  pilot 
projects, DWM, DPD, and AECOM will have 
conducted two rounds of detailed hydraulic 
modeling  to  refine  the  specific  locations 
and green infrastructure footprints. The first 
round of modeling is aimed to test specific 
design assumptions, while the second round 
is  aimed  at  quantifying  specific  benefits 
of  potential  projects  (e.g.  gallons  of  water 
removed, street flooding reduction, amount 
of  sewer  relief)  along  with  high  level  cost 
estimates.  Solution  design  is  based  upon 
the results of the hydraulic modeling.
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE 
SOLUTIONS:
The  City  will  review  the  level  of  capital 
investment estimated to achieve the desired 
stormwater  run-off  reduction  and  co-
benefits for each project site. Final solution 
mix  will  likely  consist  of  familiar  green 
infrastructure interventions, to be applied in 
site-specific ways.

The  City  will  build  upon  existing  relation-
ships, forge new partnerships, and identify 
new  funding  streams  or  novel  funding 
mechanisms  to  support  these  projects,  to 
be designed by fall 2019. Looking forward, 
the pilot will serve as a template to expand 
green  infrastructure  investments  more

broadly  across  the  city, 
including  the 
establishment of capital budgets, definition 
of  selection  criteria,  and  action  plans  for 
project execution. 
NEXT STEPS
Complete  the  second  round  of  detailed 
hydraulic  modeling,  begin  solution  design, 
secure  funding  commitments,  and  finalize 
project completion timeline for each of the 
four sites. n

DESCRIPTION
The  City  of  Chicago’s  bikeshare  program, 
Divvy,  currently  spans  more  than  100 
square  miles  and  approximately 
1.84 
million residents – 68 percent of the city’s 
population  –  live  within  a  half  mile  of  a 
Divvy station. To connect more residents to 
opportunities, increase the reach of public 
transit, and provide an active and affordable 
solution to mobility challenges, the City will 
continue  to  expand  the  Divvy  network  to 
neighborhoods currently lacking bikeshare 
service.

a  six-month  pilot  program  that  included 
multiple  private  companies  to  explore  the 
potential  of  dockless  bike  technology  and 
to provide access to bikeshare services for 
communities  on  Chicago’s  far  South  Side. 
Upon analysis of the pilot’s results, the City 
will  examine  how  dockless  bikes  could  be 
incorporated  into  Chicago’s  transportation 
landscape,  including  as  part  of  the  Divvy 
system.

These  efforts  combined  will  strengthen 
bikeshare  in  Chicago,  promote  healthier 
communities,  and  ensure  residents  are 
better  connected 
to  economic  and 
recreational activities across the city.

NEXT STEPS
Renew and enhance the Divvy sponsorship, 
analyze the dockless bikeshare pilot results, 
and  conduct  stakeholder,  community,  and 
aldermanic  engagement  to  inform  Divvy 
expansion. n

Divvy provides opportunities for first- and 
last-mile  transit  connections  for  residents 
without a vehicle or with limited access to 
bus, rail, or other transportation options. New 
options  for  extended  ride  time  also  make 
Divvy  a  convenient  option  for  recreation 
and  leisure,  aligning  with  CDPH’s  Healthy 
Chicago  2.0  Plan  to  reduce  root  causes 
of  obesity  and  improve  health  outcomes. 
For  Chicagoans  facing  financial  barriers, 
the  Divvy  for  Everyone  (D4E)  program

Recent  advancements  in  mobility  have 
begun  to  change  urban  mobility  patterns 
and  behaviors.  The  New  Transportation 
and  Mobility  Task  Force,  established  in 
September 2018, will help advise the City on 
how to plan, evaluate, and manage current 
and  new  mobility  options  along  with  the 
integration  of  technological  innovations

•  Expanding and ensuring equitable and 

sustainable access to high-quality, reliable, 
accessible public transit and mobility 
options through a variety of potential 
approaches, including a value-driven 
bus network plan; integrated fares and 
ride payment technologies for multi-
modal transportation; and synchronized 
policies for improving access for low-
income, disabled, and senior resident 
communities.

•  Guiding integration and prioritization of 

new mobility providers and technologies, 
including autonomous, connected 
and electric vehicles; new ride-sharing 
options; new forms of bikeshare and 
scooters; and smart traffic infrastructure, 
including those that protect pedestrians,

The  City  will  pilot 
innovative  mobility 
solutions in two Chicago community areas: 
Gage Park and Washington Heights, on the 
Southwest and far South Sides of Chicago, 
respectively. A robust selection process was 
used in identifying these two communities 
as  priority  areas  for  the  pilot,  the  results 
of  which  will  inform  future  approaches  to 
mobility challenges, in particular for similarly 
disconnected residents living on the South,

DESCRIPTION
The  ability  for  residents  to  move  around 
the  city  with  ease  can  have  a  significant 
impact  on  employment  opportunities, 
access  to  services,  and  overall  quality  of 
life.  Direct  collaboration  between  different 
transportation  providers  –  for  example, 
CDOT,  CTA,  ridesharing  companies,  and 
other private sector entities – can improve 
the city’s transportation network and bolster 
connections between residents and various 
education, 
training,  and  employment 
opportunities. Through the implementation 
of  a 
joint  planning  and  community 
engagement  process,  new  approaches  to 
mobility challenges will be designed with a

COMMUNITY SELECTION 
METHODOLOGY
The pilot community selection methodology 
involved  a  three-step  screening  aimed  at 
addressing the question, “What transit and 
mobility initiatives best improve connections 
between  Chicago’s  jobs  and  job  training 
centers  and  residents  living  in  areas  with 
high rates of unemployment?”

The screening process included:
1) Transit Service Assessment
2) Mobility/Connectivity Evaluation 
3) Priority Community Area Assets

This  analysis  examined  all  Chicago 
community  areas  in  order  to  identify  two 

9 6

communities  as  pilot  areas  for  innovative 
mobility  solutions.  The  following  provides 
additional  detail  into  each  step  of  the 
process.

1) Transit Service Assessment
The Chicago transit system is a critical mode 
of transportation to consider as part of any 
mobility  analysis  of  the  city.  Public  transit 
is often a primary mode of transportation, 
particularly in areas of high unemployment 
and for individuals accessing education and 
job training opportunities. In many cases, it 
is the only form of mobility available for a 
trip. As such, an assessment was conducted 
to  provide  a  high-level  understanding  of 
transit service across all community areas.

“Transit captive riders” refers to individuals 
that rely on transit for their mobility needs. 
This  term  is  used  to  describe  riders  who 
do  not  have  immediate  access  to  private 
transportation,  such  as  a  vehicle,  or  who 
must  otherwise  use  public  transit  in  order 
to travel.

2) Mobility/Connectivity Evaluation
This  analysis  compared  different  Chicago 
community  areas  across  five  evaluation 
criteria: (i) employment, (ii) unemployment, 
(iii)  environmental 
income, 
and  (v)  access  to  educational  workforce 
development opportunities.

* Employment refers to the number of community areas residents employed 
(regardless of the job location) and not the actual number of jobs within each community.

** Job training center typologies were assigned weighted scores based on the level of employment assistance capabilities. 
Weighted scores were assigned as follows: City Colleges (8 points), City of Chicago Workforce Centers (6 points), 
Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership (4 points), Currently Funded Workforce (4 points), and Connect Chicago (2 points). 

For  each  criterion,  the  community  area 
with  the  least  favorable  measure  received 
the  highest  point  total,  with  remaining 
community  areas  receiving  a  fraction  of 
points indexed to the community area with 
the least favorable measure.

20 points for this criterion. If community B’s 

unemployment rate is 20 percent, it receives

3) Pilot Community Area Assets 
Additional data regarding the unique assets, 
challenges,  and  opportunities  of  each 
community area was examined, which led to 
the selection of Gage Park and Washington 
Heights as pilot communities for the below 
reasons:
•  Given  the 

large  number  of  young 
residents,  high  rates  of  unemployment, 
and the lack of nearby job training centers, 
opportunities exist to connect residents to 
jobs and to create training and educational 
programs  to  develop  resident  skill  sets. 
Existing  transportation  and  community 
assets  could  be  leveraged  to  expand 
access to these opportunities.

•  Existing  transit  options  could  benefit 
from  enhanced  multimodal  coordination 
to 
resident  mobility.  Many 
residents  are  located  more  than  a  half-

opportunities to create solutions to bridge 
first- and last-mile barriers.

DESCRIPTION
In response to President Trump’s decision 
to  withdraw  the  U.S.  from  the  Paris 
Agreement, the Chicago Climate Charter 
was established as a framework for Mayors 
to  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  a 
sustainable  future  in  direct  partnership 
with  other  cities.  The  charter,  created  in 
December  2017  at  the  North  American 
Climate  Summit  in  Chicago,  garnered 

city-specific  commitments  that  centered 
on common themes, ideas, and actions to 
aggregate  impact  and  provide  guidance 
for Mayors looking for novel ideas. 

By signing the charter, more than 70 cities 
have pledged to: 
1.  Achieve a percent reduction in carbon 
emissions in line with their respective 
countries’ national commitments under 
the Paris Agreement (26 to 28 percent 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2025 for U.S. cities);

2.  Quantify, track, and publicly report city 

emissions, consistent with standards 
and best practices of measurement and 
transparency;

3.  Advocate alongside other mayors for 

greater local authority and flexibility 
to develop policies and local laws that 
empower cities to take aggressive action 
on climate; 

4.  Recognize and include groups   
    traditionally underrepresented in 
    climate policy, including women, racial 
    and ethnic minorities, indigenous 
    peoples, persons with disabilities, and 
    socially and economically marginalized 
    communities; 
5.  Incorporate the realities of climate 
change and its impacts into local 
infrastructure and emergency planning 

through strategies of adaptation and 
resilience; 

6.  Support strong private sector, 

regional, state, and federal policies 
and partnerships that incentivize the 
transition to a new climate economy; 
and

7.  Partner with experts, communities, 

businesses, environmental justice groups, 
advocates, and other allies to develop 
holistic climate mitigation and resilience 
solutions.

Examples  of  city-specific  commitments 
made  by  local  leaders  include:  investing 
in  public  transit  systems  to  reduce  the 
carbon  footprint,  providing  safe  public 
transportation  and  accessible  land  use, 
accelerating  affordable  renewable  energy 
access,  and  reducing  the  carbon  footprint 
in  new  and  existing  public  and  private 
buildings and infrastructure.

In  the  coming  years,  the  City  of  Chicago 
will  continue  to  bring  in  more  cities  as 
signatories to the charter and track progress 
of  individual  commitments  and  overall 
emission reductions.

NEXT STEP
Continue outreach to additional mayors to 
increase the number of signatories and total 
aggregate  impact  of  the  commitments 
made under the charter. n

Upholding Chicago’s Commitment  
to the Paris Agreement 

looking 

recommendations 
forward. 
Potential pathways to deliver on Chicago’s 
commitment may include initiatives related 
to  energy  efficiency  in  residential,  com-
mercial,  or  new  construction,  distributed 
solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  systems,  travel 
mode  shift,  and  vehicle  fuel  switching, 
among many others. 

Chicago will also use the results of the report 
to shape an inclusive climate action plan – as 
part of its commitment as a C40 member 
city – to be developed with implementation 
begun by the end of 2020.

BENEFITS
Climate  change  is  the  foremost  challenge 
facing  current  and  future  generations. 
Through its efforts to reduce GHG emissions, 
the City will lessen the impacts of climate 
change  and  serve  as  a  model  for  other 
municipalities  to  follow.  Chicagoans  –  and 
more  broadly,  residents  around  the  world 
–  stand  to  benefit  from  local  leadership 
on  this  issue  in  the  form  of  less  severe 
weather  events,  increased  food  security, 
better  health  outcomes,  and  more  stable 
livelihoods overall.

OVERVIEW
In  June  2017,  Mayor  Emanuel  issued  an 
Executive  Order  committing  Chicago  to  a 
26  to  28  percent  reduction  in  greenhouse 
gas  (GHG)  emissions  from  2005  levels 
by  2025,  consistent  with  the  terms  of  the 
Paris Agreement. Among several activities 
established in the order, City departments 
must  work  collaboratively  and  develop 
and  implement  standards,  policies,  and 
practices to assist Chicago in achieving this 
ambitious goal.

Existing policies and programs – for example, 
the  Future  Energy  Jobs  Act  (FEJA),  an 
aggressive  State  policy  that  seeks  to 
significantly expand energy efficiency and 
renewable  energy  programs  across  Illinois 
–  have  already  had  a  significant  impact. 
Recent  analysis  has  shown  that  total  city 
GHG emissions are projected to decline by 
14  percent  from  2015  levels  to  2025.  This 
translates  to  an  expected  total  city  GHG 
emissions  decrease  of  24  percent  from 
2005 levels to 2025, just shy of the desired 
26 to 28 percent reduction.

With  this  in  mind,  and  to  ensure  Chicago 
meets  its  ambitious  target,  the  City  will 
release a new report in 2019 to demonstrate 
progress  made  to  date  and  to  outline

RESILIENT CHICAGOCASE STUDY  Chicago Smart 

Lighting Program

infrastructure 

OVERVIEW
Over a four-year period, the City of Chicago 
Smart  Lighting  Program  will  replace  over 
270,000  city  street  lighting  fixtures  and 
make  targeted 
improve-
ments to the City’s outdated lighting. Phase 
I of the Smart Lighting Installation, which 
lasted  from  September  2017  to  August 
2018,  focused  predominantly  on  streets, 
alleys,  and  arterials  in  South  and  West 
Side  communities.  Phase  II,  which  began 
in October 2018 and will be completed by 
2019,  will  continue  work  throughout  the 
city.

The  new  lights,  which  will  be  owned  and 
operated  by  the  City,  consume  50-75 
percent less electricity than existing high-
pressure sodium (HPS) lights, and generate 
significant  electricity  cost  savings  that 
will offset the cost of modernization. LED 
fixtures last two to three times longer than 
the previous technology, which will greatly 
improve the reliability of Chicago’s lighting. 
The  new  smart 
lighting  management 
system will increase efficiency by allowing 
the  City  to  identify  potential  outages, 
prevent  them  when  possible,  and  restore 
service more quickly when needed.

By  switching  to  energy  efficient  LED 
streetlights,  the  City  will  cut  its  streetlight 
electricity costs by more than half, yielding 
savings of approximately $100 million over 
10  years.  The  City  also  expects  to  qualify 
for  up  to  $35  million  in  ComEd  energy 
efficiency rebates due to the switch.

Residents  can  track  the  progress  of  the 
program at chicagosmartlighting.org.

BENEFITS
The  City  of  Chicago  Smart  Lighting 
Program  will  help  decrease  disparities 
within  Chicago’s  neighborhoods  through 
the  provision  of  more  robust 
lighting 
infrastructure. Investments in more efficient, 
reliable  lighting  will  help  foster  economic 
development  and  support  ongoing  crime 
reduction efforts.

In addition, the smart lighting management 
system  will  enable  CDOT  to  remotely 
monitor  and  control  the  City’s  outdoor 
lighting. This will strengthen the connection 
between  the  City  and  local  residents  by 
improving  the  City’s  responsiveness  to 
service  requests  through  the  use  of  real-
time outage updates.

DESCRIPTION
In  April  2017,  Mayor  Emanuel  announced 
the  City’s  commitment  to  transition  all 
public  building  electricity  use  to  100 
percent  renewable  energy  sources  by 
2025.  By  greening  its  energy  supply,  the 
City continues to establish itself as a clean 
energy leader in its effort to combat climate 
change.  When  implemented,  Chicago  will 
be  the  largest  major  city  in  the  country 
to  have  a  100  percent  renewable  energy 
supply for its public buildings.

The  commitment  will  be  met  through 
a  combination  of  acquiring  Renewable 

Energy  Credits  (RECs),  utility-supplied 
renewable  energy  via  Illinois’  Renewable 
Portfolio Standard, and on-site generation. 
The Chicago Infrastructure Trust (CIT) has 
released  a  Request  for  Proposals  (RFP) 
for  developers  to  install  on-site  renewable 
energy generation facilities on City-owned 
vacant  lots  as  a  market  signal  to  activate 
dormant resources and jumpstart the green 
economy in low-income communities. This 
project  will  create  ground-mounted  solar 
facilities  in  communities,  and  utilize  the 
Illinois Power Agency’s Solar for All program 
to  grant  energy  savings  to  community 
residents. Within the next year, the City will 
devise  a  comprehensive  plan  to  procure 
on-site and off-site energy generation and 
purchase  RECs  based  on  infrastructure 
analyses and market evaluation.

NEXT STEPS
Develop plan to procure on-site and off-site 
energy generation and purchase RECs. n

The RFP included requirements to meet 
Minority and Women Business Enterprise 
(MBE/WBE) participation and workforce 
development goals. For this project, 
the MBE and WBE goals are set at 26 
percent and 6 percent, respectively. For 
all construction work, a minimum of 50 
percent of the total work hours must be 
performed by Chicago residents, at least 
7.5 percent of which must be performed by 
project area residents.

the  largest  buildings  in  the  city.  Energy 
benchmarking  generates  a  1-100  ENERGY 
STAR® score for buildings, with a score of 1 
indicating a poor performer, 50 an average 
performer, and 100 a top performer. While 
energy performance is improving for many 
buildings,  other  properties  continue  to 
perform  below  local  and  national  median 
levels.  At  the  same  time,  many  tenants, 
visitors,  building  engineers,  and  property 
managers  remain  unaware  of  the  results 
from their energy benchmarking reports. 

In  late  2017,  Chicago  updated  its  Energy 
Benchmarking  Ordinance 
to  promote 
visibility  of  data  reporting  surrounding 
building  energy  performance.  These 
updates, to be rolled out in 2019, will create 
a  new  Chicago  Energy  Rating  system  for 
buildings required to benchmark. The City 
will engage building stakeholders to inform 
them  of  upcoming  changes.  The  new 
program  will  make  energy  performance 
information  simpler,  easier  to  understand,

team  commits  to  achieving  a  20  percent 
reduction in energy use over five years. To 
encourage  participation,  the  City  provides 
a forum for teams to share best practices 

and  recognizes  all  participants  who  meet 
reduction targets.

To  date,  participating  property  teams 
have  achieved  a  nearly  15  percent  energy 
reduction  across  a  total  of  87  buildings, 
saving  over  $10.6  million  in  annual  costs. 
The  City  will  continue  to  recruit  new 
property teams to join the Retrofit Chicago 
Energy Challenge and facilitate their energy 
reductions, with a goal of having over 100 
participants by the end of 2020.

NEXT STEPS
Roll out the Chicago Energy Rating system 
for  buildings  required  to  benchmark;

DESCRIPTION
Many trucks and buses that travel through 
Chicago consume diesel fuel, whose exhaust 
contains  a  variety  of  pollutants,  including 
particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon 
monoxide,  carbon  dioxide,  and  other 
chemicals that form ground-level ozone and 
contribute to climate change. More efficient 
hybrid and electric fleet vehicles can reduce 
harmful diesel emissions and directly benefit 
the health of residents. However, due to the 
higher relative purchase cost of these clean 

POTENTIAL KEY INDICATORS

EQUITY IMPACTS
Reducing diesel emissions from vehicles 
improves air quality for all residents and 
has an especially strong health impact 
on older adults, young children, and 
people with asthma, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart 
disease. Residents in South and West 
Side communities, which experience the 
highest rates of these illnesses, will benefit 
particularly.

Drive Clean Chicago provides a point of sale 
discount on purchased or leased electric or 
hybrid  vehicles  operated  in  the  Chicago 
area. The first round of Drive Clean Chicago 
funded nearly 400 vehicles, which annually 
reduce 8,300 tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, the equivalent of removing 1,700 
cars from Chicago roads.
With over $20 million in additional Federal 
Congestion  Mitigation  and  Air  Quality 
(CMAQ)  funding,  the  City  will  continue  to 
operate  Drive  Clean  Chicago  to  provide 
innovative,  point  of  sale  incentives  for

DESCRIPTION
The  City  of  Chicago  is  committed  to 
expanding its use of electric vehicles (EV) 
and  reducing  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) 
emissions  in  its  own  operations.  A  City 
transition  to  an  EV  fleet  lowers  GHG 
emissions detrimental to public health and 
decreases 
local  government  operating 
costs  through  streamlined  operations.  The 
replacement  of  daytime  fueling  with  an 
end  of  day  plug-in  and  overnight  charge 
will  contribute  to  budget  savings,  reduce 
future  tax  burdens  on  citizens,  and  allow 
City employees to focus on providing public 
services. Unlike traditionally fueled vehicles, 
whose emissions can worsen over time, the 

NEXT STEP
Continue to engage the U.S. Department of 
Transportation  to  disburse  program  funds 
to support charging station installation and 
the transition to a 25 percent EV City fleet 
by 2023. n

POTENTIAL KEY INDICATORS
①  Number of electric vehicles in the City’s 

fleet

② Number of charging stations installed
③  Reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions

④  Dollar value reduction in operational 

and maintenance costs of vehicles

EQUITY IMPACTS

All residents will benefit from improved air 
quality, including residents with specific 
health conditions (e.g. asthma) or of a 
certain age (e.g. the elderly or young 
children).

City’s EV fleet contributes to the greening 
of the City’s energy consumption.

The  City  has  set  an  ambitious  goal  of 
attaining  a  passenger  fleet  that  is  25 
percent  EV  by  2023.  To  support  this, 
the  City  secured  $15.5  million  in  Federal 
Congestion  Mitigation  and  Air  Quality 
(CMAQ)  Program  grant  funding  that 
allows  for  investment  in  182  EVs  for  the 
City’s vehicle fleet, nine DC-Fast Charging 
stations, and 182 Level 2 charging stations. 
Pending the disbursement of these funds 
from the U.S. Department of Transportation, 
the  program  will  move  forward.  These 
investments will ensure the City remains on 
track to achieve its 2023 goal.

CDA will also install, operate, and maintain 
80  Level  2  and  20  Fast  Chargers  at 
O’Hare  International  and  Chicago  Midway 
International  Airports.  Charging  access 
at  both  airports  will  enable  the  efficient 
recharging  of  Chicago’s  growing  number 
of  electric  taxicabs,  limousines,  shuttles, 
and rideshare vehicles serving the airports’ 
100  million  plus  passengers  each  year. 
Additionally, CDA will operate a fleet of six 
electric  shuttle  buses  –  supported  by  at 
least two fast charging stations – to service 
airport parking facilities, replacing a diesel-
operated service.

DESCRIPTION
According to the Chicago 2015 greenhouse 
gas 
the 
transportation  sector  is  responsible  for 
26  percent  of  Chicago’s  emissions.  The 
CTA  transit  system  plays  a  critical  role  in 
reducing  transportation-related  emissions. 
On  the  typical  weekday,  CTA  provides 
over 1.53 million bus and rail rides, often in 
place of trips using higher polluting modes 
of  transportation.  These  benefits  can  be 
further  multiplied  by  upgrading  to  zero 
emission,  electric  transit  buses,  providing 
health  benefits  to  residents  vulnerable  to          
emissions  generated  from  diesel-powered 
vehicles.

CTA  has  announced  its  commitment  to 
purchase between 20 to 30 electric buses 
(e-buses),  with  the  option  to  purchase 
up  to  45  e-buses  over  the  next  several 
years.  In  June  2018,  CTA  awarded  a  $32 
million  contract  for  its  initial  20  e-buses, 
which will operate on the Chicago Avenue 
(#66)  bus  route,  a  high-ridership  route 
between  downtown  and  neighborhoods 
on  Chicago’s  West  Side.  CTA  is  pursuing 
various funding opportunities to complete 
the transition to electric buses. 

NEXT STEP
Identify  additional  funding  sources  to 
increase CTA’s e-bus deployment from 20 
to  45  and  complete  the  electrification  of 
the Chicago Avenue (#66) bus route.  n

POTENTIAL KEY INDICATORS
①  Reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions

② Reduction in gasoline gallon equivalents 
③  Number of e-buses deployed within the 

CTA fleet 

④  Reduction in dollar value of operational 

and maintenance costs of bus fleet

EQUITY IMPACTS
All residents will benefit from improved air 
quality, especially residents living near the 
Chicago Avenue (#66) bus route, many 
of whom reside in West Side communities 
that experience among the highest rates 
of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), and heart disease.

DESCRIPTION
Launched  in  December  2017,  the  Urban 
20  (U20)  is  a  city  diplomacy  initiative  led 
by  the  cities  of  Buenos  Aires  and  Paris, 
and  facilitated  by  the  C40  Cities  Climate 
Leadership  Group.  The  initiative  creates  a 
platform  for  mayors  of  Group  of  Twenty 
(G20)  cities  to  contribute  to  the  G20 
agenda  by  coordinating  positions  and 
collective  messages  on  global  issues  of 
climate  action,  sustainable  development, 
and their socioeconomic ramifications.

Chicago  will  serve  as  a  core  city  in  this 
initiative, and its participation will help raise 
its  global  profile  and  provide  insight  for 
other  cities  based  on  what  Chicago  has 
already  accomplished  regarding  initiatives 
in  this  sector.  To  this  end,  the  cities  that 
comprise U20 are committed to:

1.  Generating a collective platform on behalf 
of global urban centers, to be shared in a 
coherent and organized manner with G20 
leaders;

2.  Enriching  the  general  G20  agenda  by 
exploring and contributing cities’ unique 
perspectives and good practices;

3.  Proposing  joint  solutions  to  enhance 
sustainable 
economic  development, 
using  tools  from  the  current  G20  urban 
agenda  and  cities’  experience-based 
recommendations; and

4.  Promoting 

in 
inter-city  collaboration 
implementing  G20-led  measures 
to 
maximize  benefits  and  ensure  positive 
results.

The first U20 meeting was held in January 
2018 in Paris to solidify the Joint Statement, 
an  official  letter  from  U20  Mayors  to  G20 
leaders setting forth the shared aspirations 
and  goals  of  signatories.  The  statement 
reflects priorities that shape U20, including: 
climate  action,  the  future  of  work,  social 
integration,  women  empowerment,  and 
access to finance.

Signatories 
like  the  City  of  Chicago 
commit to working towards and achieving 
specific  goals  on  each  of  these  priorities, 
including  decarbonizing 
energy 
grid  at  the  national  and  local  levels  by 
2050,  implementing  violence  prevention 
programs,  and  achieving  more  compact 
and  better-connected  cities  to  maximize 

the 

1 0 9

access  to  employment  and  business-to-
business connections.

More recently, in October 2018, the inaugural 
U20  Mayor’s  Summit  was  held  in  Buenos 
Aires,  where  a  final  Communiqué  was 
approved.  The  Communiqué  calls  on  G20 
leaders  to  prioritize  an  urban  perspective 
in  tackling  global  challenges,  and  can  be 
accessed at bit.ly/U20Communique.

NEXT STEP
Convene the next meeting of U20 Mayors in 
Tokyo in 2019 to continue emphasizing U20 
perspectives,  priorities,  and  actions  that 
should be prioritized by G20 leaders. n

POTENTIAL KEY INDICATORS
①  Number of joint solutions proposed by 

participating U20 cities

②  Number of joint actions taken by 

participating U20 cities

③  Number of actions taken by G20 

member states

EQUITY IMPACTS
Chicagoans will benefit from the collective 
advancement of U20 priorities regarding 
climate action, the future of work, social 
integration, women empowerment, and 
access to finance.

DESCRIPTION
Community  solar  expands  access  to  the 
renewable  energy  economy  for  low-  to 
moderate-income  customers  and  builds  a 
distributed and more resilient electric grid. 
To  help  meet  Illinois’  renewable  energy 
goals,  the  State  of  Illinois  can  purchase 
a  community  solar  project’s  Renewable 
Energy  Credits  (RECs)  under  the  2016 
Future  Energy  Jobs  Act  (FEJA).  FEJA’s 
framework further incentivizes community 
solar activity in Chicago by mandating that 
utility  companies  provide  savings  through 
solar  generation  for  community  solar 
subscribers. 

Given these factors, and to promote greater 
access to community solar, the City will:

solar  options.  The  City  will  identify  site 
opportunities, 
strengthen  policy  and 
incentives,  conduct  educational  activities, 
and monitor uptake of local solar facilities 
to  be  shared  by  multiple  community 
subscribers to help achieve this.

Additionally,  the  City 
is  part  of  the 
Community  Solar  Stakeholder  Advisory

multi-use  approach  to  an  area,  such  as 
housing, businesses, and amenities within 
a half-mile radius of transit stops, to create 
walkable communities and reduce reliance 
on  automobiles.  However,  TOD  can  also 
be  a  driver  of  displacement,  reducing  a 
neighborhood’s affordability and resulting

within the community. 

RESILIENT CHICAGOSECTION 5: PREPARED COMMUNITIES

PILLAR 3: PREPARED COMMUNITIES

As the “city of big shoulders,” Chicagoans 
take  pride  in  their  ability  to  rise  to  any 
challenge. Recent events in the city’s history 
– for example, the 1995 heat wave and the 
2011  blizzard  –  serve  as  a  reminder  that 
the city’s resilience hinges on the strength 
of  the  connections  between  residents, 
communities, and local government.

Chicagoans  must  be  able  to  access 
resources, avail themselves of services, and 
communicate with ease in times of crisis. 
Underlying every prepared community is a 
connected community.

To this end, residents must be equipped with 
the relationships, skillsets, and knowledge 
base  to  anticipate  and,  when  necessary, 
overcome  challenging  times.  Community-
driven initiatives – including efforts led by 
Austin  Coming  Together,  Garfield  Park 
Community  Council,  and  West  Humboldt 
Park  Development  Council  to  promote 
stormwater preparedness among residents 
–  are  examples  of  how  local  action  can 
foster community resilience. 

technology  becomes 

As 
increasingly 
important  to  how  residents  connect  with 
one  another  and  local  government,  the 
current era of rapid technological change 
must work for all Chicagoans. To this end, 
the  City  has  forged  strong  partnerships 

foster  positive 
relationships  between 
residents and first responders, and leverage 
technology  to  increase  the  accessibility 
and impact of information.

with  public,  private,  and  non-profit 
sectors  to  promote  digital  equity  across 
the  city’s  communities.  This 
includes 
working  with  companies 
like  Google, 
Cisco, and Everywhere Wireless to provide 
free  wireless  services  at  Chicago  parks 
and  beaches  and  the  Connect  Chicago 
Innovation Program, managed by the City 
Tech Collaborative, which seeks to increase 
tech access, skills, and engagement.

Additionally,  the  City  is  making  concrete 
investments in the tools it uses to connect 
with  residents  and  is  modernizing  the 
ways  in  which  these  tools  are  used. 
The  City’s  new  Open311  system  enables 
residents to create, track, and map service 
requests,  submit  photos,  and  provide 
feedback, among other features, bringing 
unprecedented levels of access, innovation, 
and  accountability  to  the  delivery  of  City 
services. The new Smart911 system enables 
residents  to  create  a  safety  profile  about 
their household so that first responders are 
better informed during an emergency.

DESCRIPTION
Chicago’s 311 service is the point of entry for 
residents, business owners, and visitors that 
seek  to  access  government  services  and 
information. DOIT, OEMC, CDPH, and DFSS 
are collaborating to implement an Open311 
system with streamlined capabilities and a 
modern  customer  relationship  approach 
aimed  at  improving  service  delivery  for 
residents. As part of this process, the City 
has engaged residents, community groups, 
and  elected  officials  to  inform  system 
design, increase engagement with 311, and 
identify priority health and human services 
to be included.  

real-time tracking, and allow the City to 
eliminate paper-based or unnecessary 
process steps.

The new Open311 was launched in December 
2018. Training on how to use the system will 
be made available at CPL branches and by 
local community organizations. By the end 
of  2019,  the  City  will  integrate  health  and 
human  service  resource  information  into 
the Open311 website, and update operator 
workflows  to  refer  311  callers  to  externally 
managed hotlines as needed. Find out more 
about the new system at whatsthe311.org. 

NEXT STEPS
Launch  the  new  Open311  and  provide 
community trainings in early 2019. The City 
will  also  continue  to  incorporate  resident 
input and feedback into the system, rolling 
out  new  features  throughout  the  year. 
Complete integration of health and human 
service  information  and  update  operator 
workflows by the end of 2019. n

The modernization of 311 aims to:
•  Meet residents where they are, enabling 

Chicagoans to submit service requests by 
phone, web, mobile app, text, or Twitter.

•  Provide transparency into how City 

services are delivered – once a resident 
submits a request, they will see the 
estimated completion date and get 
automatic updates as work is completed.

•  Improve resident experience by

providing a singular location to access 
City information—including information 
about health and human services, such 
as housing assistance, food, job training, 
economic support, healthcare, and legal 
services.

•  Educate and inform community residents 
who opt-in on seasonal and other public 
health issues via email, text, or mobile 
app notifications.

•  Identify areas for service delivery 

improvement with continuous monitoring 
and performance measurements. For 
example, the City will be able to audit and 
address service requests that take longer 
than expected.

•  Enable departments to better manage 
and track their work. For instance, the 
system will enable departments to assign 
work within a single system, provide

DESCRIPTION
The  use  of  email  newsletters 
to 
communicate with residents varies among 
City  departments  and  agencies.  Currently, 
the  Mayor’s  Office  sends  out  several 
targeted  email  newsletters,  including  from 
the  Office  of  Public  Engagement  and  the 
Office  of  New  Americans.  Additionally,  a 
number of City departments and agencies 
notify  residents  of  programs,  resources, 
and  other  information.  For  example,  the 
Department of Cultural Affairs and Special 

Events (DCASE) highlights free, upcoming 
cultural events in its regular newsletter.

The  Mayor’s  Office  can  serve  as  a  leader 
in  coordinating  efforts  to  provide  regular, 
unified updates from the City to residents. 
With  the  creation  of  a  new,  centralized 
email  newsletter,  Chicagoans  will  benefit 
from a reduction in duplicative or piecemeal 
updates  currently  provided  by  different 
City departments, agencies, and aldermen. 
While communications from these entities 
will continue, a centralized City newsletter 
will elevate only the timeliest of initiatives, 
programs,  and  services  that  benefit  all 
residents. The newsletter can also connect 
residents  across  Chicago’s  77  community 
areas  by  highlighting  local,  community-
based activities for all to see.

NEXT STEP

RESILIENT CHICAGOGOAL 2:
REDUCE VULNERABILITIES 
TO EXTREME WEATHER 
EVENTS FOR DISCONNECTED 
CHICAGOANS

While  all  Chicagoans  can  be  impacted  by  extreme 
weather events, the most vulnerable residents can endure 
a  tremendous  burden  due  to  inadequate  resources, 
preparedness, or access to key information and services. 
Entire communities can suffer significant property loss, 
illness, injury, and in the worst cases, death. This goal aims 
to address these vulnerabilities by identifying the areas 
most impacted by extreme weather and improving the 
City and communities’ ability to respond when it strikes.

ONGOING

ACTION 41

Foster Community Preparedness 
for Stormwater Events

Through  these  efforts,  three  community 
workshops  were  held,  six  community 
gardens  were 
retrofitted,  and  nearly 
four  dozen  local  residents  were  involved. 
Looking forward, the City will convene key 
partners,  stakeholders,  and  neighborhood 
groups  to  implement  similar  community-
based  initiatives  in  2019  and  beyond. 
This  could  entail  an  expansion  to  include 
additional  priority  community  areas,  new 
partner organizations, and varied types of 
green infrastructure projects. A new stream 
of  funding  will  need  to  be  identified  to 
support emerging projects.

NEXT STEPS
Convene  meetings  to  identify  potential 
locations,  partners,  and  projects  to  be 
implemented  in  2019  and  beyond,  while 
simultaneously  identifying  a  new  funding 
source for emerging projects. n

projects and make necessary changes in 
day-to-day organizational operations.

The  City  will  evaluate  and  integrate  best 
practices  as  part  of  its  hazard  mitigation 
planning,  including  the  inclusion  of  more

The Midwest heat waves of 1995 and 1999 
together claimed more than 1,300 lives, with 
an estimated 739 in Chicago alone.

During past extreme heat events, Chicago’s 
ability to respond has been hindered by its 
lack of available data. Present day challenges 
persist  due  to  gaps  in  data,  isolated 
datasets, and other issues surrounding data 
accessibility.  The  Urban  Heat  Response 
pilot  project  will  bring  together  a  broad 
coalition  of  stakeholders  to  explore  data-
based approaches to mitigate the negative 
impacts  of  extreme  heat  events.  The  pilot 
will inform and improve decisions on near-
term planning as well as long-term planning 
regarding 
resilience 
investments.

DESCRIPTION
Exposure to dangerously high temperatures 
is  a  significant  public  health  risk  that  is 
increasing  with  climate  change.  Recent 
research  revealed  that  the 
frequency, 
duration, and intensity of heat waves in 50 
large U.S. cities rose significantly from 1961 
to 2010, and today, extreme heat events are 
responsible for more annual fatalities in the 
U.S. than any other form of extreme weather.

Phase 1 of the pilot will focus on use case 
definition,  data  gathering,  and  value 
definition to generate a detailed framework 
for 
implementation.  For  example,  this 
could focus on quantifying the impacts of 
specific  investments  in  green  roofing  on 
the reduction of urban heat island effects. 
Phase 2 of the pilot will commit to building 
a  minimum  viable  product  necessary  to 
drive  decision-making  regarding  future 
extreme  heat  episodes.  For  instance,  this 
could  entail  generating  a  clear  rationale 
for  the  prioritization  of  additional  green 
roofing or other investments to ensure risk 
is  sufficiently  mitigated  in  the  most  heat-
vulnerable communities.

1 2 6

NEXT STEP
Convene  stakeholders  to  finalize  Phase  1 
and establish the use case scenario for the 
pilot. n

POTENTIAL KEY INDICATORS
①  Reduction in urban heat island effects 
from specific investments, e.g. in green 
roofing

②  Number of wellness checks related to 

heat risks

③   Number of heat-related illnesses or 

other incidents reported

EQUITY IMPACTS

The Urban Heat Response pilot will benefit 
heat-vulnerable populations, e.g. senior 
residents, youth, outside workers, people 
with disabilities, and those with chronic 
medical conditions. 

RESILIENT CHICAGOGOAL 3:
INCREASE SOCIAL  
CONNECTEDNESS AND  
PERSONAL RESILIENCE OF 
CITY FIRST RESPONDERS TO 
BETTER SERVE RESIDENTS

City  first  responders  must  react  to  unpredictable 
situations on a daily basis, which for many Chicagoans, 
can  be  among  the  most  challenging  moments  of  their 
lives. Whether in fielding a 911 call or in being dispatched 
to a location, first responders are asked to reliably serve 
residents under tense circumstances. To ensure that first 
responders can effectively perform their duties, this goal 
outlines specific actions to build supportive relationships 
with residents and design new interventions to promote 
first responder well-being.

DESCRIPTION
Mayor  Emanuel’s  Citywide  Mental  Health 
Response  Steering  Committee  is  leading 
the City’s efforts to improve crisis response 
for individuals with mental illness. With this 
initiative, the City aims to reduce the stigma 
associated  with  mental  illness,  which  can 
be  a  barrier  to  an  effective  response.  The 
City  also  seeks  to  foster  an  environment 

that  includes  adequate  treatment  options, 
actions  in  times  of  crisis,  and  increased 
public  understanding  of  the  signs  and 
symptoms of mental illness.

The  City  will  implement  its  Community-
Based  Mental  Health  Awareness  Project, 
which  provides  free  training  to  trusted 
mentors – such as school staff, faith leaders, 
and 
individuals  from  community-based 
organizations  (CBOs)  –  to  gain  awareness 
of the indicators of a possible mental health 
crisis.  Residents  also  learn  about  available 
support services, including specially trained 
Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) police officers 
in times of need. Trainings are delivered by 
mental  health  experts  and  providers  and 
the  underlying  curriculum  is  approved  by 
faculty from UIC’s Jane Addams College of 
Social Work to ensure cultural and linguistic  
competency.

The creation of a vast, well-trained network 
of  community-based  mentors  allows 
for  more  sustained,  hands-on  support 
of  residents  potentially  suffering  from 
mental illness. In turn, this enables City first 
responders  –  particularly  CIT  officers  –  to 
focus  their  efforts  primarily  on  the  crisis 
situations for which they are trained.

As  part  of  the  project,  500  community 
stakeholders from Greater Roseland will be 
trained, with a plan for expansion to other 
communities  based  upon  input  from  the 
advisory  group,  community  stakeholders, 
and project leaders. With additional project 

1 2 8

funding, entry into new communities could 
occur by early- to mid-2019.
NEXT STEP
Formalize  commitment  of  community-
based partners to establish a schedule for 
mental health trainings into 2019, including 
an  expansion  to  communities  beyond 
Greater Roseland with the identification of 
additional project funding. n
POTENTIAL KEY INDICATORS
①  Increase in mental health literacy (i.e. 
knowledge of signs and symptoms 
of mental illness), as measured by 
indicators in pre- and post-tests at 
training events

②  Reduction in stigmatizing attitudes 

or beliefs about mental illness, as 
measured by indicators in pre- and 
post-tests completed at training events

③  Requests for deployments of CIT 

officers in mental health-involved crisis 
situations 

④  Increase knowledge of and referrals to 

professional mental health services

EQUITY IMPACTS
Residents with mental illness, their 
families, and neighbors, particularly in 
Greater Roseland and potentially other 
communities with high rates of mental 
health-related incidents.

DESCRIPTION
Community  policing 
the 
fundamental belief that a strong partnership 
between  government  and  residents  can 
help  solve  many  of  the  complex  issues 
that  drive  crime  and  violence.  Given  the 
checkered  history  of  the  relationship 
between  residents  and  law  enforcement 
–  especially  in  light  of  several  recent,  high 
profile  incidents  across  the  U.S.  resulting 
in  the  fatal  wounding  of    civilians  by 
responding  police  –  the  possibility  for  a 

strong  partnership  can  often  feel  beyond 
reach.  This  sentiment  is  especially  strong 
among residents in Chicago’s communities 
of color, many of whom have been subject to 
significant policing over the years, yet who 
still  fare  poorly  with  respect  to  key  public 
safety,  health,  and  other  socioeconomic 
outcomes. 

With this in mind, the Community Policing 
Advisory  Panel  (CPAP)  issued  a  series  of 
recommendations  for  consideration  by 
CPD in developing its community policing 
strategy. The CPD Superintendent approved 
the new strategy in 2017, which laid out a 
vision for community policing that calls for: 
(i) a true partnership with communities, (ii) 
a  role  for  all  City  departments  and  sister 
agencies, (iii) the breaking down of barriers 
between youth and the police, and (iv) the 
alignment of CPD staffing and resources. 

Further, CPD recently published its roadmap 
report, 2018 Next Steps for Reform, which 
outlines the actions that the CPD Office of 
Community Policing (OCP) sought to take 
in 2018, namely:
1.  Develop, publish and implement OCP-, 
Bureau-, and District-level community 
policing strategies to promote 
transparency and trust in government;

2.  Provide District offices with staffing 

necessary to properly implement the 
updated strategies;

3.  Select a broad group of community 

members, District Community Liaisons, 
to introduce newly assigned police 
officers to neighborhoods in their 
new districts of assignment to foster 
authentic partnerships;

4.  Facilitate partnerships with other 
City departments, sister agencies, 
and existing community networks, 
particularly those related to youth and 
families;

5.  Hire 30 additional personnel to the 

OCP, including community organizers, 
domestic violence advocates, youth 
service coordinators, area coordinator 
managers, and an information services 
coordinator; and

6.  Develop a web-based community 

policing portal to enhance CPD’s ability 
to monitor the implementation of 
community policing recommendations 
and serve as a platform for direct 
engagement with the public.

the  advancement  of 

Through 
these 
activities,  CPD  aims  to  foster  stronger 
relations  between  its  first  responders  and 
residents in addressing the core causes of 
crime and violence.

level community policing strategies; Hiring

DESCRIPTION
In  dialing  911,  Chicago  residents  in  the 
midst of crisis situations reach OEMC first 
responders, who are responsible for fielding 
phone  calls  and  delivering  what  can  be 
life-saving assistance. Ensuring that OEMC 
staff  are  present,  accessible,  and  provide 
helpful  responses  is  therefore  of  utmost 
importance. However, data shows that the 
OEMC  911  call  center  suffers  from  higher 
staff  absenteeism  rates  relative  to  other 
City departments and agencies.

While  the  precise  reasons  behind  these 
elevated  absenteeism  rates  are  unknown,

OVERVIEW
In October 2017, Mayor Emanuel and DOIT 
launched  the  redesigned  City  of  Chicago 
website at cityofchicago.org. The updated 
website design is the first major redesign 
since  2010,  and  features  incremental  and 
critical  changes  to  improve  usability  and 
accessibility. 

The  more  user-friendly  interface  creates 
a better experience for Chicago residents 
and  visitors.    The  website  is  now  mobile-
friendly, making it accessible to most users 
who  access  the  site  from  smartphones 
or  tablets.  Additionally,  key  services  and 
transactions are prominently presented on 
the site to help users find information more 
easily than before.

City  departments  have  updated  and 
improved their web presence, with pages 
information 
reorganized  to  emphasize 
about 
the  core  services 
that  each 
department provides. All pages are easier 
to read due to an improved color scheme, 
and  new  images  and  graphics  make  the 
site more inviting and give a more modern 
feel.

DESCRIPTION
Residential energy use, transportation, and 
waste  are  key  drivers  of  greenhouse  gas 
(GHG)  emissions  in  Chicago.  As  a  way  to 
promote  more  sustainable  living  practices 
among  its  residents,  the  City  offers  a 
variety  of  programs  and  incentives  to 
reduce  residential  utility  costs.  Residents 
can avail themselves of these offerings by 
taking  steps  to  lower  energy  and  water 

POTENTIAL KEY INDICATORS
①  Number of website visits, social media 

engagements, and click-throughs to 
City offerings

②  Participation rates in Retrofit Chicago 

and MeterSave programs

③  Dollar value of household waste-related 

cost savings

④  Number of community-based 

sustainability programs

the most significant reductions in 
residential utility cost burden.

usage,  increase  waste  diversion  rates,  and 
switch to cleaner modes of transportation. 
However, it can be difficult for residents to 
locate these offerings and ultimately access 
these services.

The  City  of  Chicago  received  a  $150,000 
Partners for Places grant from the Funders’ 
Network and local matching organizations 
– CCT and ISEIF – to connect low-income 
residents  to  City  sustainability  initiatives, 
to  encourage  Chicago  residents  to  adopt 
more  sustainable  practices,  and  to  help 
residents save money while doing so. Using 
input  gathered  from  residents  engaged 
from  winter  2017  to  spring  2018,  the  City  
will develop a web-based platform to inform 
and  engage  residents  on  sustainability 
initiatives, to be launched in early 2019.

like Vision Zero, Resilient Corridors, and the 
City’s Tech Plan.

Because  the  data  is  published  openly 
and  without  charge,  it  will  also  support 
the  equitable  development  of  innovative 
applications,  such  as  a  mobile  application 
that allows residents to track their exposure 
to certain air contaminants, or to navigate 
through  the  city  based  on  avoiding  urban 
heat  islands,  poor  air  quality,  or  excessive 
noise and congestion.

EQUITY IMPACTS

Residents will be able to reliably access 
public safety and critical services 
during a cyber attack; residents, 
employees, and contractors will benefit 
from enhanced protection of personal 
information.

to  operate  in  the  event  of  incidents  or 
disasters, the City will continue to refine 
and  build  on  its  business  continuity 
plans,  set  up  technology  infrastructure 
to support the ability to recover quickly 
and maintain operations, with a focus on 
public  safety  and  critical  infrastructure 
systems. As such, in late 2017, the OEMC 
brought together 132 personnel from 23 
different City Departments for Continuity 
of  Operations  training.  The  training 
focused  on  creating  and  updating 
continuity  plans  for  departments  and 
kicked  off  regular  follow  up  from  the 
OEMC  with  the  various  departments  on 
the  progression  and  the  status  of  their 
COOP plans. 

The  City  will  also  continue  to  lead  a 
Chicago-area  Cyber  Security  working 
group  to  find  efficiencies  and  build  the 
maturity of each agency’s cyber security 
efforts  more  effectively.  This  includes 
leveraging  common  security  tools  to 
reduce  costs,  creating  training  materials 
centrally to reduce duplication of effort, 
and  working  from  a  common  base  of 
policies to improve vendor compliance.

NEXT STEPS

Community  Climate  Forum,  which 
gathered  1,500  residents  at  the  Field 
Museum  for  an  evening  of  storytelling, 
music,  dance,  food,  and  commitment 
to  tackling  local  causes  and  impacts  of 
climate change. On the eve of the North 
American  Mayors  Climate  Summit,  the 
Chicago  Community  Climate  Forum 
also introduced the Chicago Agreement 
on  Climate  and  Community  (bit.ly/
ChicagoAgreement),  an  online  pledge 
that  voices  shared  beliefs,  aspirations, 
and  personal  commitments  to  build 
community-based resilience.

In 2018, the Partnership introduced three 
interrelated efforts to: (i) take the Chicago 
Agreement  to  the  next  level,  building  a 

foundation  for  collaborative  action;  (ii) 
connect individuals and resources across 
communities and organizations; and (iii) 
engage  in  community-led  projects  in 
Chicago-area neighborhoods.

impact  stem  from  collaboration  among 
related  organizations  and  efforts  with 
similar  goals,  with  a  specific  focus  on 
the  intersection  between  climate  and 
other pressing urban issues. The ongoing 
Partnership  is  working  to  build  on  the 
momentum  of  the  Chicago  Community 
Climate  Forum  and  to  support  the 
resilience efforts of its members.

THE CHICAGO COMMUNITY 
CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP’S WORK IN 
ACTION
In a short time, the Chicago Community 
Climate  Partnership  has  emerged  as  a 
powerful  platform  to  connect,  support, 
and  grow  Chicago-area  climate  and 
resilience  efforts.  To  date,  more  than 
600  individuals  and  organizations  have 
signed  the  Chicago  Agreement,  and 
plans  are  underway  for  community-

RESILIENT CHICAGOSECTION 6: CONCLUSION 

THE PATH FORWARD

Resilient Chicago is the result of a multi-
year  planning  process  spurred  by  100 
Resilient  Cities’  generous  decision  to 
support Chicago’s efforts to build urban 
resilience in the city. 

In  shaping  Resilient  Chicago,  numerous 
residents,  community 
leaders,  stake-
holders,  organizations,  and  agencies 
helped  identify  the  city’s  most  pressing 
resilience  challenges,  which  center 
around issues of disconnection. The city’s 
history  of  neglect  and  discrimination 

coupled  with  emerging  threats  such  as 
a  changing  climate  and  economy  have 
contributed  to  the  challenges  residents 
face, which include barriers to accessing 
economic  opportunity,  limited  mobility 
options,  and  lack  of  social  cohesion, 
among others.

Resilient  Chicago  presents  a  vision 
for  the  city  –  one  where  residents, 
neighborhoods, 
and 
government  agencies  are  successfully 
connected  to  each  other  in  the  pursuit 

institutions, 

of  economic  opportunity,  safety,  equity, 
and  sustainability.  The  strategy  also 
describes  a  number  of  actions  that  will 
benefit residents, in particular those most 
vulnerable.

The  strategy  represents  the  starting 
point  for  many  of  the  actions  found 
within 
its  pages.  The  City,  partner 
organizations,  community  leaders,  and 
local  residents  must  remain  committed 
to its implementation towards building a 
more resilient Chicago.
