DALLAS’ PATH TO SHARED PROSPERITY

About 100 Resilient Cities

Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) is dedicated to helping cities around 
the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 
21st century. 100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just the 
shocks—earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.—but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or 
cyclical basis. By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to adverse 
events, and overall, is better able to deliver basic functions to all populations in good times and bad.

The City of Dallas thanks

The universities, nonprofits, and businesses, as well as the 100RC platform partners, whose contributions 
of research, science, and data were invaluable to the development and success of this Resilience 
Strategy. That work greatly expanded the capacity of City staff and was foundational to the analysis and 
recommendations put forward in this report. Additional thanks go to the 100RC City Solutions team, who 
marshaled resources and leveraged 100RC's platform of tools and services to bolster the work undertaken 
in each Discovery Area.

LETTERS FROM MAYOR RAWLINGS AND 100RCLETTER FROM T.C. BROADNAX

T.C. Broadnax, City Manager

Although I’ve served as the City Manager for just over a year, I have quickly grown 
to love my new hometown and am very proud of the workforce I am honored to 
lead. From our librarians who spend their weekends sharing the joys of reading 
with children, to our sanitation workers leaving the yard before sunrise, to our 911 
operators assisting frightened residents late into the night, the public servants of 
Dallas are committed to improving the lives of Dallas residents.

Our work is challenging, yet gratifying. We strive to deliver service with four core 
values in mind—empathy, ethics, excellence and equity. We recognize we are 
first and foremost a service organization and always cognizant of our primary 
focus, the people. The people and families who call Dallas home and strengthen 
our neighborhoods deserve and expect the highest level of customer service. The 
businesspeople and investors who have chosen to make their livelihoods here and 
build a prosperous economy drive us to be innovative and find efficient, data-driven 
solutions to vexing problems. The artists who offer their talents to enrich our lives 
and the faith leaders who nourish our souls call on us to govern with compassion and 
respect. Dallas is fortunate to be home to a diverse and thriving population.

Dallas is a prosperous community, and we are blessed with the continued prospect 
of sustained economic growth. Yet despite an optimistic outlook, large segments 
of our community are not thriving. Too many of our residents are confronted 
every day by challenges to simply exist—homelessness, poverty, unemployment, 
underemployment, social and racial inequity, gun violence, food insecurity, access to 
quality education. This is Dallas’ true resilience challenge: overcoming the social and 
economic challenges that deny many of our residents’ social justice and economic 
well-being for themselves and their families.

As the hard work of this Resilience Strategy and the Mayor’s Task Force on Poverty 
has shown, disparity in our community continues to escalate at a rate and scale 
that surpasses our peer cities. Not surprisingly, this disparity falls along racial and 

ethnic lines. The residents 
impacted are the working poor, 
people who struggle to make 
ends meet despite full-time 
employment.

These are residents who offer 
us an opportunity to make a 
difference in their quality of life, 
to help neighborhoods flourish, 
and businesses prosper. To 
secure Dallas’ position as 
the economic powerhouse of 
north central Texas, we must 
eradicate the barriers that 
prevent hardworking residents 
from achieving economic 
mobility and build pathways 
for those who strive to achieve 
prosperity. This is the critical 
work of resilience building that 
must be done for our community and our residents to succeed.

T.C. Broadnax, City Manager

True public service lies in equitable service delivery to our most vulnerable residents. 
It is a spirit of excellence that drives this passion for public service within me. I 
challenge myself and will continue to challenge my staff to be excellent public 
stewards and to serve with empathy for our residents, to maintain the highest ethical 
standards, and strive to achieve equity for all Dallas residents.

Sincerely,

RESILIENT DALLAS

LETTER FROM 100RC

Michael Berkowitz, 100 Resilient Cities 

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate Mayor Mike 
Rawlings, City Manager T.C. Broadnax, and the City of Dallas on the release of 
Resilient Dallas. This is a major milestone for the city and our partnership with it.  

One of the fastest growing and dynamic cities in the U.S., Dallas is the heart of the 
North Central Texas region. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the fourth largest in 
the country, with more than 7.2 million people. Its vibrant economy continues to grow 
and contribute to Texas’ impressive figures in job growth, which have led the country 
since the Great Recession. 

However, this prosperity has not reached all of Dallas’ residents. Many communities, 
especially those of color, continue to struggle with endemic poverty that severely 
limits their opportunities and ability to participate in civic life. Alongside Dallas’ 
impressive wealth are some unsettling figures, such as one of the highest child 
poverty rates in the country. While the city faces similar acute shocks as other cities 
in the network, such as extreme weather and natural disasters, it is these stresses 
related to equity that stand to undermine Dallas’ chances for a vibrant future and 
which this Strategy addresses.

Central to Dallas’ success is the fate of its working poor and other communities that 
do not benefit from the city’s wider positive trajectories. Many stresses combine 
and are caused by this inequity: poor public health; lack of access to education 
and employment opportunities; poor mobility and public transportation options; and 
a major gulf between the city’s anglophone, and mostly white, population and its 
Hispanic communities, which comprise 41% of the city. Almost a quarter of the city is 
foreign-born, and 42.5%  of people speak a language other than English at home. As 
the city grows, it must cultivate the opportunities available to these communities and 
address their particular needs.

disparities between rich and poor, 
between those with opportunity and 
those without, Resilient Dallas helps 
advance an understanding that for a city 
to be resilient, these gaps must  
be addressed.

Michael Berkowitz, President

Chief Resilience Officer Theresa 
O’Donnell has helped shape and guide 
this work. She has boldly and tirelessly 
sought to impress the importance 
of confronting Dallas’ severe social 
inequities. She has also collaborated 
with the partners in the 100 Resilient Cities network, such as 4th Economy and 
Citymart, to help the city better understand its public health and workforce challenges 
and chart a path to address them. In partnership with the CUNY Institute for State & 
Local Governance and other university partners, she is designing an equity indicator 
framework to measure Dallas’ progress toward achieving greater equity over time. 
And she has collaborated extensively with other city leaders, such as Regina 
Montoya, who leads the Mayor’s Task Force on Poverty. Through their work and 
the Strategy, the city is well-poised to make great strides toward bridging the gaps 
keeping so many residents from the opportunities they need to make themselves, 
and Dallas, stronger. 

This Strategy is an incredible achievement, but in many ways, the hard work is just 
beginning. We are excited to see the goals and initiatives in these pages take shape 
and lead Dallas toward a vibrant future in which all its citizens thrive and contribute to 
its success.

This Strategy sets out a pioneering vision for addressing inequity as one of the major 
challenges of the 21st century. As cities across the country grapple with widening

INSPIRATIONRegina Montoya, Mayor’s Task Force on Poverty

While watching the play LBJ All the 
Way, I was moved by one of the 
opening scenes that recounts our 
former President’s early days as a 
teacher in south Texas. During that 
impressionable time in his life, LBJ 
taught the young Hispanic children of 
migrant workers. During the school 
year, he observed the formidable 
transformation in these children as the 
light in their eyes drained away under 
the harsh realities of growing up in 
poverty. His early experiences watching 
these families struggle to maintain their 
livelihood and well-being shaped LBJ’s 

Regina Montoya
commitment to public service, which brought us many of the anti-poverty programs 
that still exist today.

My work on the Mayor’s Task Force on Poverty and Resilient Dallas has moved 
me in much the same way. I am troubled by the statistics and stories we have 
uncovered and reported during these important efforts. Dallas’ numbers on 
childhood poverty are staggering. The data on disparity are equally distressing. 
However, we cannot get mired in the data and forget the real people behind these 
numbers. Peoples’ lives are burdened under the heavy weight of poverty and 
disparity, and their opportunities for a better life are foreclosed. These conditions 
endanger the resilience of the individual, the family, and our community.

Although difficult, this work has been rewarding as I have been inspired by the 
hundreds of organizations committed to helping these families find pathways out of 
poverty. I have also gained fresh insight into the obligation of our local government 
to its vulnerable and marginalized residents. The analysis that undergirds the 
recommendations in this Strategy confirms the tremendous impact public policy has 
on the everyday lives of the working families of Dallas. More importantly, it illustrates 
the success of these governmental systems when they function in service to our 

residents—and the tremendous gaps created 
when these systems fail our vulnerable and 
marginalized residents who need them most.

Our leading academic institutions and think 
tanks have studied and analyzed these 
gaps. Leaders in our community—from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, to business 
leaders and major employers, to the Mayor 
of Dallas —have opined on the impacts of 
these trends. Journalists, commentators, 
and media partners have covered stories of 
family struggles, displaced neighborhoods, 
and ramifications for the broader community. 

It is time for government to listen.

“The analysis that 
undergirds the 

recommendations in 
this Strategy confirms 

the tremendous 

impact public policy 
has on the everyday 
lives of the working 
families of Dallas.”

Business leaders, nonprofits, and 
philanthropic organizations are doing meaningful work in our community that 
requires collaboration and coordination with local government partners to maximize 
its potential impact. Local governments play a necessary leadership role by 
providing vision and direction in partnership with the community as we respond to 
the factors contributing to the growing economic and social disparity in Dallas.

I believe the goals and initiatives identified in the Resilient Dallas Strategy provide 
a solid roadmap to begin this effort. By undertaking these recommendations, Dallas 
can align with anchor institutions and other key partners to bolster efforts and find 
new solutions that allow hard-working families to defy the constraints imposed by 
their zip code. Let’s work together to change the trajectory of these trends, start to 
close this gap between the haves and the have-nots, restore opportunity to hard-
working families, and bring the light back to the eyes of the children of Dallas.

Sincerely, 

RESILIENT DALLAS

DFW IS THE
BUSIEST U.S. AIRPORT

The North Central Texas population grew an eye-popping 35% between 2000 
and 2014 and is projected to reach 10 million by 2040, overtaking Chicago as 
the nation’s third largest metro area. Per capita income soared by 46% during 
the same period. DFW consistently ranks as one of the top destinations for 
corporate relocations because of its central location, expansive transportation 
infrastructure, low tax rate, and business-friendly regulatory climate. Other 
trends driving this super-charged growth are the diversity and strength of 
the economy and the relatively low cost of living, especially in housing.

Dallas is the Economic Engine

Downtown Dallas is the heartbeat of this prosperity, boasting finance, real 
estate, insurance, banking, and silk stocking law firms housed in architecturally 
distinctive Class A office buildings. Dallas is the residential destination of choice 
for millennials and immigrants willing to work hard and gamble on an innovative 
business venture, or baby boomers eager to enjoy an enriched quality of life in 
the center of art, culture, and fine dining. Given this tremendous prosperity and 
these strong competitive advantages, Dallas’ economic resilience and dominance 
should be unquestioned. However, in-depth examination reveals several disturbing 
trends that could compromise Dallas’ ability to lead the region in the future.

Resilience Challenges

A growing number of Dallasites live on the edge of economic failure. Dallas 
has nearly 4,000 homeless individuals. Census numbers indicate poverty has 
increased 42% during the past 15 years, and more than 36% of Dallas households 
struggle financially. The problems these residents grapple with are numerous 
and intertwined: low skills or language barriers limit employment opportunities, 
lack of health insurance often leads to poor health as medical concerns spiral 
into medical emergencies, and lack of reliable transportation restricts access to 
jobs, education, and even healthy food. Dallas’ biggest resilience challenge is not 
the devastation of a tornado, flood, or other natural disaster. Nor is it the tragedy 
of a horrific event such as the July 7th attack on the Dallas Police Department. 
Rather, it is the economic vulnerability of Dallas’ poor who struggle to provide 
for themselves and their families, weakening the community’s resilience.

RESILIENT DALLAS

PURPOSEDisparity in Dallas

The data uncovered during this study tell us what Dallas has intuitively known 
for decades. White Dallasites earn more money and live in more affluent 
neighborhoods with better amenities and services than their counterparts 
who are African American or Hispanic. On average, African Americans earn 
54 cents for every dollar their white counterparts earn, and they are more 
than six times as likely to be poor even with a full-time job. White children 
are better prepared for elementary school, better prepared for college or the 
workforce, and far less likely to go to bed hungry at night. Hispanics are four 
times as likely to be uninsured, and only 56% of their children are enrolled in 
pre-kindergarten. All too often, people who live this disparity have little hope 
their future will look different than it does today. Moreover, history tells them 
the disparity that threatens the well-being of their families today will only be 
worse tomorrow.This disillusionment is fueled by a basic lack of trust―trust that 
those with the power to change the current inequities have the will to do so. 

A resilient, equitable Dallas must have the trust of its residents. While Dallas 
has made some significant inroads toward equity, progress has been slow and 
much work is left to be done. A deep and abiding cynicism exists. If Dallas is 
ready to begin down a path of building trust and advancing equity, this Strategy 
offers suggestions on the partnerships and actions necessary to begin the hard 
work of examining interconnected systems of public policies and institutional 
practices that perpetuate inequity in Dallas and trap people in poverty.

These systems, functioning independently or in combination, often exacerbate 
the impact of a weather-related disaster,a fluctuating economic cycle, or an 

incident of civil unrest when experienced by marginalized 
or disadvantaged residents. Understanding the 
interdependent relationships between catastrophic 
events or prolonged stresses and the impacts on 
Dallas’ most vulnerable residents shaped the early 
research and informed the development process. This 
Resilience Strategy examined a number of systems 
that are not attuned or responsive to the needs of 
Dallas’ vulnerable or marginalized residents―systems 
that, if acclimated to those needs, would work more 
effectively for all Dallas residents. The Strategy 
contemplates the current functioning of a number of 
those institutional and governmental systems and offers 
practical initiatives to improve upon them, such as:

A resilient, 
equitable 
Dallas must 
have the 
trust of its 
residents.

  Building economic mobility for Dallas’ working poor
  Nurturing healthy children
  Investing in Dallas’ low-income neighborhoods
  Expanding access to opportunity through improved public transport

Only when Dallas residents are provided the opportunity to build their individual 
resilience will Dallas become a resilient and equitable city. While widening 
disparities may appear to be an insurmountable challenge, Dallas has a long 
history of pursuing radical ideas and daring approaches to achieve results that 
elude the less ambitious. After all, the Dallas ethos is Big Things Happen Here!

DEVELOPING THE STRATEGYRESILIENT DALLASWhat Is Urban Resilience? 

Resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, 
businesses, and systems within a city to adapt, grow and thrive in the face 
of both shocks (sudden traumatic events like earthquakes and floods) and 
more long-term, chronic stresses, like poverty and housing shortages. 
City resilience is about making a city better, in both good times and bad, 
for the benefit of all its citizens, particularly the poor and vulnerable.

Qualities of Resilient Systems and Cities

When looking at individual systems, it is helpful to think about what qualities of 
those systems enhance their resilience. 100RC has identified a set of qualities 
that describe the behavior or performance of resilient systems that enable 
them to withstand, respond, and adapt more readily to shocks and stresses:

REFLECTIVE: Using past experience to inform future decisions

RESOURCEFUL: Recognizing alternative ways to use resources

ROBUST: Well-conceived, constructed, and managed systems

REDUNDANT: Spare capacity purposely created to accommodate disruption

FLEXIBLE: Willingness and ability to adopt alternative strategies in response to 
changing circumstances

INCLUSIVE: Prioritizing broad consultation to create shared ownership in  
decision-making

INTEGRATED: Bringing together a range of distinct systems and institutions

The City Resilience Framework, created by Arup in partnership with the 
Rockefeller Foundation, is a tool to help us understand the many drivers that can 
contribute to building resilience in a city. In the Resilience Strategy process, we 
often use this framework as a lens to diagnose where the city has gaps to improve 
upon its capacity or opportunities to build upon.

RESILIENT DALLASDEVELOPING THE STRATEGYHow We Got Here
Civic Engagement

Along with a wealth of economic, physical, and environmental resources, 
Dallas is enriched by an abundance of residents and businesses, professional 
and technical experts, philanthropic foundations and social service providers, 
and multiple academic institutions, all of whom are committed to effectual 
civic involvement to improve local governance. Expert and community 
leaders obligated themselves to countless hours of stakeholder workshops, 
oversight committees, and topic area work groups. Together they articulated 
Dallas’ ambitions and recognized its potential for a brighter future.

The Dallas Resilience process relied heavily on extensive community 
participation by everyday residents, as well. This Resilience process 
integrated the insight and wisdom gained through many forms of participation 
that acknowledged and respected the similarities, as well as the notable 
differences inherent in Dallas’ economically and socially diverse population.

While desktop research, academic studies, best practices, and other analytic 
tools are instrumental in understanding the trends and conditions present in the 
Dallas community, this Strategy is about people. Essential to this process of 
knowledge building was the valuable step of validating research findings and 
general assumptions through “ground truth” obtained during interviews and 
listening sessions with people who experience the challenges and opportunities 
explored in this study. This inclusive perspective was used to identify gaps 
that would normally go unobserved by more traditional research methods. 
Although many of these conversations were difficult, this type of honest reflection 
and open dialogue is foundational to building a common understanding of 
the challenges facing many Dallasites and exploring potential solutions.

This Community Stakeholder Committee 
worked through several key exercises 
and engaged in dynamic discussions 
to define an early set of priorities and 
resilience issues, setting the stage 
for the first phase of discovery.

Phase I

The extensive 
involvement 
by Dallasites 
strengthened  
our knowledge  
base and built 

genuine community  
support and trust

To explore and expand on the 
recommendations of the Agenda Setting 
Workshop, staff undertook an intensive data 
collection effort, combined with insights 
collected from more than 100 stakeholder 
interviews with the public, nonprofits, private 
enterprises, and government agencies. 
Data collected included more than 130 
“resilient actions” already occurring within the City, an asset inventory, and broad 
background research on municipal government. Additionally, staff conducted a 
resilience perception exercise to identify the similarities and differences between 
resident perceptions and City initiatives. A deep examination of the data and 
insights revealed a series of trends that intersected multiple quadrants of the 
City Resilience Framework, helping formulate the early iterations of the Dallas 
Discovery Areas—key resilience topics requiring further investigation. Those 
early iterations were taken back to the public for vetting and further refinement 
in several small group settings, as well as a second full-day stakeholder 
workshop with more than 120 multi-sector professionals and technical experts. 
The experts validated findings, refined staff understanding of challenges and 
issues, and identified collective efforts that reinforced the program goals.

Agenda Setting Workshop

The collective work of creating the Resilience Strategy began with 
convening more than 120 participants from across local government, 
the private sector, philanthropic institutions, nonprofit organizations, 
academia, and civic groups, representing more than 80 organizations.  

The Office of Resilience also consulted with the City’s top executive staff and 
the City Council’s Quality of Life committee and Human and Social Needs 
committee at all key decision points throughout this process, keeping elected 
and administrative officials abreast of the analysis and findings. The synthesis 
of this work resulted in a lengthy report, the Dallas Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment, that articulates Dallas’ four Discovery Areas: Inclusive Economy, 
Healthy Communities, Neighborhood Infrastructure, and Transportation Equity.

Dallas’ Discovery Areas

INCLUSIVE ECONOMY: Harnessing the power of the robust North Central Texas 
economy to be more inclusive and create economic resilience for Dallas residents

HEALTHY COMMUNITIES: Exploring opportunities to improve public health 
outcomes and decrease health disparities

NEIGHBORHOOD INFRASTRUCTURE: Assessing conditions in Dallas 
neighborhoods to drive equitable public sector investments and understanding 
the impacts of climate change on the natural and built environment to improve 
environmental health

TRANSPORTATION EQUITY: Preparing for a 21st-century urban mobility by 
leveraging the region’s transportation investment to expand mobility options and

Phase II

The Discovery Areas became the basis of an extensive Phase II scope 
of work. For several months, staff worked with internal and external 
stakeholders to build and strengthen partnerships, explore opportunities, 
analyze research, and review programs currently underway to comprehend 
the challenges that constrain Dallas’ resilience now and in the future.

A Community Advisory Committee, appointed and chaired by Regina Montoya, 
oversaw the Phase II work. Dedicated to civic leadership on a variety of important 
subjects, Ms. Montoya also serves as the Chair of the Mayor’s Task Force on 
Poverty. For the past two years, this Task Force has built an extensive community 
education and engagement process with subject matter experts, service providers, 
and philanthropic organizations. The efforts and successes of the Task Force 
informed and undergirded the work of the Community Advisory Committee and 
supplemented the substantial work of the Discovery Area Working Groups. The 
Committee’s role was to bring a broad perspective and ensure the cross-cutting 
challenges confronting Dallas’ most vulnerable residents are not combated 
with single-focus programs, but with comprehensive multi-benefit solutions.

Four Discovery Area Working Groups were also created to do the hard, technical 
work of building new knowledge through research and analysis within four 
distinct focus areas. These working groups were led by a collaborating City 

department and consisted of 
six to 10 members of City staff 
and key external community 
partners. The leaders of each 
working group coalesced into 
an effective Steering Committee 
that met weekly with the Chief 
Resilience Officer to advance their 
independent work and ensure 
each of the four groups were 
cognizant of the intersections 
and opportunities in other study 
areas. The purpose of the Steering 
Committee was to synergize the 
work by each individual groups 
to support and reinforce the 
overarching goals of the effort.

All this work culminated 
in the development of 
cross-cutting goals, 
initiatives, and actions that correspond with each of the four Discovery 
Areas and are intended to move Dallas toward greater equity on a number 
of intersecting social and economic measures. In addition to the four 
Discovery Areas, the Dallas Resilience Strategy also includes goals and 
initiatives on the important and timely issues of equity and immigration.

While the goals, initiatives, and actions are organized into six distinct topical 
areas, they all work to address the city’s crucial need to advance equity. The 
data and information documented in this Strategy reveal deep, long-standing 
disparity in Dallas. It is worth noting many highly regarded community leaders 
have voiced their concern that if this disparity continues to persist and grow, 
it will erode the strength and resilience of the city as a whole. The robust 
economy of Dallas and the North Central Texas region rely on the city’s 
overall vigor and adaptability, particularly the readiness and capability of its 
workforce, the reach and effectiveness of its transportation system, and its 
ability to afford residents the opportunity to live healthy, productive lives.

PARTNERSHIPSPartnerships

Dallas is enriched by an abundance of residents and businesses, professional 
and technical experts, philanthropic foundations, nonprofits and social service 
providers, and multiple academic institutions―all of whom are committed to 
effectual civic governance. The success of this Strategy is due entirely to Dallas’ 
many thought leaders who dedicated their time, expertise, and research to 

shape this Strategy and the possibilities it contains. Experts and community 
leaders obligated themselves to countless hours of stakeholder workshops, 
oversight committees, and topic area work groups. Together they articulated 
Dallas’ ambitions and recognized our potential for a brighter future.

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

A Resilient Dallas is an equitable Dallas

The poverty rate in Dallas is outpacing its overall population growth. Unless we commit to understanding the root 
causes of disparity and the inequities it creates, we will be naive to the burdens imposed on our marginalized 
residents. More importantly, we must examine the governmental policies and programs that reinforce these 
disparities and trap Dallas residents in poverty.
Goal 1: Advance equity 
in City government.
Confront the disparities that challenge 
our marginalized residents by committing 
to understanding, identifying and 
measuring inequity, tracking it over 
time, and adopting data-driven policy 
solutions to close the disparity gap.

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

Truth, Racial Healing 
& Transformation

In 2016, the Kellogg Foundation developed a 
Truth, Racial Healing & Transformation (TRHT) 
framework to guide communities in identifying 
and removing barriers to racial equity and 
reconciliation, as well as dismantling racism 
and the hierarchy of human value. Dallas is 
one of 14 recipients of a Kellogg Foundation 
grant to conduct our own TRHT effort, led by 
a community-based Steering Committee.

“The time is at hand for all of us to acknowledge 
our collective pain, challenge our perceptions 
about race and race relations, promote 
authentic relationship building and establish 
equitable policies that serve and benefit all, 
and not just a few. For our city to thrive, this 
is the transformation we all must seek.”

Joli Robinson 
Co-Chair of the Dallas TRHT 
Steering Committee

Jerry Hawkins 
Dallas Truth, Racial Healing 
&Transformation
In early 2018, the Dallas Truth, 
Racial Healing & Transformation 
(TRHT) Steering Committee 
selected Jerry Hawkins as the 
Director of Dallas TRHT. Hawkins is the former 
Project Director for Bachman Lake Together, a 
“collective impact” initiative that brings community-
led early childhood education, family engagement 
programs, and additional neighborhood 
resources to the residents of northwest Dallas.

1B.2 Support the efforts of Dallas ISD’s Racial 
Equity Office by acknowledging race and 
place matter in educational achievement and 
collaborating on strategies and actions to drive 
timely change in neighborhoods where disparate 
conditions impact a child’s ability to learn.

Poverty in Dallas

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

Dallas ISD  
Racial Equity Office 

Dallas ISD has established a Racial Equity 
Office (REO) with the charge to eliminate 
systemic disparities and inequitable practices 
within the school district, removing barriers to 
achievement for all student groups, with an 
emphasis on African American and English-
Language Learner Students. The REO will 
also identify and establish best practices for 
creating equitable, responsive, and culturally 
competent work and learning environments.

RESILIENT DALLAS

GOAL 2:  
WELCOMING  
CITY

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

Dallas is welcoming when we embrace our diversity

Immigrants are a growing economic force in Dallas. From 2011 to 2016, immigrants accounted for more than 40% of 
Dallas’ total population growth, and they comprise almost 32% of the employed labor force. Their contribution to the 
Dallas economy is equally impressive; immigrant households earn more than $7.9 billion in total income and wield 
$5.4 billion in spending power.

Given the uncertainty of immigration reform at the federal level and the rancorous tenor of the national debate, it is 
incumbent upon local leadership to allay fears and promote the successful inclusion of immigrants in the social and 
economic fabric of our community.
Goal 2: Ensure Dallas 
is a Welcoming City to 
immigrants and all residents.
Promote and advance the economic, 
civic, and social inclusion of 
immigrants and refugees living in 
Dallas by implementing welcoming 
policies and initiatives.

2A.1 Audit City policies concerning 
government leadership, equitable access, civic 
engagement, cultural inclusion, education, 
economic development, neighborhood 
development, and public safety for implicit 
bias and ensure equitable consideration 
of immigrant residents and visitors.

What is implicit bias?
Attitudes or stereotypes that affect our 
understanding, actions, and decisions 
without our conscious knowledge.

2A.2 Assist in the development 
and implementation of a multi-use 
identification card for Dallas residents.

Gateways for Growth

Dallas is one of 25 U.S. cities, counties, and 
regional agencies to receive a Gateways for 
Growth award for its efforts to welcome and 
recognize the contributions of immigrants 
to the community and its strong public-
private commitment to the development 
of a community-wide strategic plan. 

The Gateways for Growth Challenge is a 
competitive opportunity for local communities 
to receive direct technical assistance from 
New American Economy and Welcoming 
America to develop multi-sector plans for 
welcoming and integrating immigrants.

“While Congress debates the value of 
immigration, in city after city, the evidence is 
already in: immigrants revive neighborhoods 
and drive economic growth. The Gateways 
for Growth Challenge offers local leaders 
blueprints for attracting immigrant talent 
and jump-starting their economies.”

ECONOMIC  
MOBILITY

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

Dallas works when our people work

Since the Great Recession, the city of Dallas has consistently maintained an unemployment rate below the national 
average, and the robust regional economy continues to boom beyond all expectations. Last year, the DFW 
metropolitan area generated the highest job growth rate in the country, only 7,000 jobs shy of New York’s total, a 
metropolitan area with triple our population.

Numerous factors coalesce to explain this economic phenomenon―low cost of living, business-friendly regulatory 
environment, minimal tax burden, central location and temperate climate, a well-diversified economic base―all 
similarly impressive. But these superlative features belie an insidious poverty rate and the swelling ranks of the 
working poor.

This paradox of crushing poverty in the face of a consistently strong economy is due to a mix of national and 
global trends coupled with Dallas’ unique economic characteristics and circumstances. For the prosperity of our 
residents and our city, Dallas must expand economic mobility to move the working poor into the comfort and security of 
middle-income life.
Goal 3: Increase 
economic mobility for 
Dallas’ vulnerable and 
marginalized residents.
Reduce income inequality and increase 
economic mobility by removing barriers 
and strengthening access to workforce 
development, support services, and 
financial coaching for people who seek 
to secure living wage employment.

readiness and training,  
 
skills development, small 
 
business capacity-building, and 
access to wrap-around services to 
provide marginalized populations 
access to living wage jobs and 
career pathways.

Community Council of 
Greater Dallas

In its nearly 80 years of operation, the 
Community Council of Greater Dallas (CCGD) 
has mobilized public, private, and nonprofit 
partners to address a range of social issues, 
from health care to child care. CCGD’s 
collaborative model of leadership has led to 
the creation of numerous human services 
programs that address high-priority needs 
in the community, including the Dallas Area 
Agency on Aging, Dallas County Family Court 
Services, and Head Start of Greater Dallas.

establish a navigator service to facilitate 
access to these services and resources.

also rely on public transportation and face 
the difficult choice of spending hours on a 
bus to purchase basic staples like fruit and 
vegetables or buying processed, packaged 
foods from a convenience store closer to home.

The We Over Me farm at Paul Quinn College 
is filling this void and transforming the 
health of its community through increased 
food security, economic empowerment, and 
environmental stewardship. Paul Quinn’s 
student-employees engage in every level of 
operations, from planting and harvesting to 
marketing and financial planning, combining 
a liberal arts education with hands-on work 
experience to mold and equip them as leaders 
ready to reinvest in their community.

“Someone’s going to figure out the urban 
issues. Why shouldn’t it be the people who 
came from those urban communities that have 
a vested interest in those neighborhoods?”

Michael Sorrell 
President of Paul Quinn College

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

Dallas County  
Promise

The Dallas County Community College District 
(DCCCD) Foundation is bringing meaningful 
change and opportunity for students through its 
Dallas County Promise program. Starting this 
year, seniors at participating high schools will 
receive a full tuition scholarship to any DCCCD 
college, regardless of income or high school 
GPA. To help them navigate the ins and outs 
of the college experience, scholars are paired 
with a success coach, who provides support 
from the end of their senior year through college 
completion. Scholars are also eligible for transfer 
scholarships to UNT Dallas and Southern 
Methodist University, and DCCCD expects even 
more universities to participate in the future.

“The cost of college can be a deciding 
factor in whether or not students attend 
college. This program helps to remove that 
barrier and ensures that our students are 
even more prepared to join the ranks of 
an educated, well-trained workforce.”

Dr. Michael Hinojosa 
Superintendent of the Dallas 
Independent School District

GOAL 4:  
EQUITABLE 
ACCESS

Dallas moves when our people can move

21st-century urban mobility will be defined by accessibility, not lane miles designed and constructed for single-
occupant vehicles. A superior mobility system will provide convenient, affordable access to all aspects of urban 
living―employment, education, health care, shopping and services, and recreation. While our current transportation 
systems and infrastructure were adequate for the past century, Dallas must embrace rapidly advancing technology 
to meet the mobility demands of this century and improve transportation equity for all Dallas residents.

This will necessitate changes in transportation priorities and investments, as 
well as a new approach to city building and urban design. Dallas has already 
begun the transformation to higher density with a mix of land uses. Our 
transportation planners have also acknowledged the need to reclaim portions 
of our expansive rights-of-way to accommodate the range of mode choices 
within the public realm. Streets must be physically redefined to safely 
accommodate pedestrians, cyclists, shared mobility vehicles, and public transit, 
in addition to the private automobile. The gradual and successful transition of 
all these aspects will build not only a superior transportation system, but also 
economic and social equity for transit-dependent people who today are denied 
opportunities available to their more mobile counterparts.
Goal 4: Ensure Dallas 
provides residents with 
reasonable, reliable, and 
equitable access.
Ensure our local and regional transit 
system provides transit-dependent 
residents with reasonable, reliable, 
and equitable access to employment, 

 
 
all elements of the plan, including 
the vision, goals, guiding principles, 
partnerships, resource allocation, 
and funding priorities.

housing opportunities, and quality 
services that foster well-being.

What is accessibility?
The relative ease of reaching a meaningful 
destination, such as work, school, 
shopping or services. Accessibility 
measures should focus on equity in service 
delivery, affordability, health and safety.

Who is transit-dependent?
Individuals with limited automobile 
access who rely on public transportation 
for daily activities, usually because 
of age, income or ability.

4A.1 Incorporate extensive community 
conversations with system users and 
transit-dependent populations into 
the plan development process.

UTA Transportation  
Equity Study

Dr. Shima Hamidi at the University of Texas 
at Arlington is producing groundbreaking 
research by analyzing transportation equity 
within the city, including affordability, job and 
transit accessibility, transit coverage, and 
transit quality. The City commissioned this 
study to understand how Dallas can leverage 
transportation investments to strengthen access 
to employment, education, health care, and 
retail for its transit-dependent residents.

Lack of access to jobs via an efficient, reliable 
transit system severely limits the opportunities 
of transit-dependent households for upward 
mobility. Over time, these limitations further 
concentrate poverty and increase spatial 
segregation. The City is already using key 
findings to inform policy recommendations to 
City Council and Dallas’ transportation partners.

Dr. Shima Hamidi
Institute of Urban Studies, 
University of Texas at Arlington 
Dr. Shima Hamidi is director of 
the Institute of Urban Studies 
and Assistant Professor of Urban 
Planning at the University of Texas 

at Arlington. She also serves as the director of 
the Center for Transportation Equity, Decisions & 
Dollars, a consortium of five universities funded 
by the U.S. Department of Transportation to 
conduct transportation policy research that leads 
to innovative policy making. Dr. Hamidi’s research 
has been published in multiple planning journals 
and cited by regional and national news outlets.

GOALS AND INITIATIVES4C

  Improve transportation 
access to employment, 
 
 
housing, education, health 
care, and other essential services 
for Dallas residents by addressing 
neighborhood infrastructure and 
system operational standards.
4C.1 Collaborate with the UTA Center 
for Transportation Equity, Decisions & 
Dollars (CTEDD) on the Opportunity 
Score Study to advance research at the 
neighborhood level and use GIS analysis 
to identify system gaps and deficiencies.

GOAL 5:  
HEALTHY  
COMMUNITIES

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

Dallas is healthy when our people are healthy

“The strength of a community can be measured by how well it cares for its youngest and most vulnerable residents…”  
―Christopher J. Durovich, President and CEO of Children’s Health System of Texas

For the past 15 years, Children’s Health has produced a comprehensive report, Beyond ABC, that examines the 
quality of life of children in North Texas. Childhood well-being is measured not only by the physical, emotional, and 
mental health of an individual, but also by broader social and economic determinants that impact the lives of children.

Beyond ABC observes that despite recent improvement in many measures, significant disparity persists. Dallas has 
double the national average of uninsured. Nearly one-third of Dallas children live in poverty, and more than 160,000 lack 
sufficient nutrition to lead active, healthy lives.

Dallas was recently selected as only one of five cities to participate in a national collaborative with public health 
experts and researchers from the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University in 
Washington, D.C. This program has enriched and deepened our understanding of the adversities facing Dallas’ children 
in their homes and neighborhoods. Moving forward, Dallas will partner with governmental agencies (city, county, and 
school district), health providers, and community-based partners to share data, align programs, develop strategies, and 
advocate for improved health outcomes for our youngest and most vulnerable residents.

What are social and  
economic determinants?
The complex, integrated, and overlapping 
social structures and economic systems 
in which people live that are responsible 
for most health inequities. These include 
factors like socioeconomic status, 
education, the physical environment, 
employment, and social support networks, 
as well as access to health care.

Goal 5: Leverage 
partnerships to promote 
healthy communities.
Strengthen partnerships with anchor 
institutions to understand and address 
the social determinants of health and 
improve the well-being of Dallas residents 
in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.

  Develop new collaborative 

 

5A

strategies and align 
resources to address 

 
 
health disparities for children and 
families living with the toxic stress 
generated by adverse economic, 
social, and environmental 
conditions of poverty and blight.

Office of Community Care/
Citymart Partnership

In 2017, the City of Dallas opened a new Office of 
Community Care with the mission to provide social 
and supportive services that improve the quality 
of life for seniors, children, and other economically 
insecure residents. Because people’s lives are 
so heavily impacted by access to quality health 
care, the staff sought to better understand the 
City’s role in working with health care providers 
to ensure equitable public health outcomes.

Citymart developed the Dallas Opportunity 
Builder, a web app that allowed community 
stakeholders and subject matter experts to 
share innovative opportunities for improving 
service delivery across the City. The City tested 
these ideas in a Problem Framing Workshop 
―with key stakeholders and social service 
providers―to identify and prioritize strategies.

Four Opportunity Reports were produced that 
covered topics from job creation for disadvantaged 
communities to data-driven decision making 
and service delivery. The reports provided best 
practices and actionable recommendations.

What is toxic stress? 
Toxic stress can occur when a child 
experiences strong, frequent, and/or 
prolonged adversity—such as physical 
or emotional abuse, chronic neglect, 
caregiver substance abuse or mental 
illness, exposure to violence, and/or the 
accumulated burdens of family economic 
hardship—without adequate adult support.

5A.1 Work with the Milken Institute 
School of Public Health to identify and 
understand the health disparities produced 
by adverse community environments.

The Building Community Resilience (BCR) 
model focuses on identifying and strengthening 
buffers against negative public health outcomes 
associated with Adverse Childhood Experiences 
in the context of Adverse Community 
Environments (“the Pair of ACEs”). Dallas, one 
of only five cities selected to test and implement 
the BCR model, has already launched several 
initiatives, including Family University, which  
connects parents in the Early Head Start 
program to parenting resources and support 
in the community, and Integrated Behavioral 
Health, which seeks to make behavioral health 
care an integral part of everyday pediatric care.

The five BCR test sites are supported by the 
Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the Milken 
Family Foundation, and the Kresge Foundation.

Wendy Ellis
Building Community Resilience 
The BCR process and the “Pair 
of ACEs” concept are based 
on the research of Wendy Ellis, 
the Project Director of the BCR 
collaborative at the Milken 
Institute School of Public Health 

at George Washington University. Ellis’ work in 
children’s health and public health policy research 
and development has been noted by a number of 
national organizations, and she frequently advises 
legislative staffers in Washington, D.C. In 2017, she 
was named a Doris Duke Fellow for the Promotion 
of Child Wellbeing for her innovative research in 
strategies to prevent child abuse and neglect.

Ellis’ article detailing the BCR process, “A New 
Framework for Addressing Adverse Childhood 
and Community Experiences: The Building 
Community Resilience Model” was published in the 
September 2017 Journal of Academic Pediatrics.

GOALS AND INITIATIVESNACCHO

A key goal of the Kresge Foundation is to 
advance a partnership between the Building 
Community Resilience (BCR) collaborative 
and the National Association of City and 
County Health Officials (NACCHO), which 
partners with and advocates for change 
for local health departments across the 
U.S. Through a strategic planning process 
facilitated by NACCHO―Mobilizing Action 
through Planning and Partnership (MAPP) 
―the Dallas BCR team is strengthening its 
ties with local public health organizations.

What is a pandemic?
An epidemic of an infectious disease that 
has spread across a very wide area.

5C.1 Develop and adopt a comprehensive 
patient tracking system capable of tracking 
patients from EMS/triage through the

SUSTAINABILITY

Dallas thrives when our neighborhoods thrive

GOALS AND INITIATIVES

Resilient neighborhoods nurture relationships, foster social cohesiveness, and strengthen civic engagement. As 
Dallas prepares to spend more than $1 billion from the 2017 Bond Program, we must ensure public investment 
supports healthy and sustainable communities.
Goal 6: Invest in 
neighborhood infrastructure 
to revitalize historically 
underserved neighborhoods.
Improve the quality of the natural 
and built environment through 
sustained and intentional public-
sector commitment of services, 
resources, and infrastructure funding.

6A.1 Partner with the Trust for Public Land in 
leveraging the robust GIS platform it created 
to analyze and assess the long-term resource 
and funding commitments necessary to 
build and maintain open space infrastructure 
with additional GIS-based datasets such as 
the Market Value Analysis, socioeconomic 
demographics, and social determinants of 
health; commit to using this analytic tool 
to evaluate significant public investment in 
infrastructure, housing, economic development 
projects, and environmental initiatives.

Smart Growth for Dallas is a partnership 
between The Trust for Public Land, 
the Texas Trees Foundation, and 
buildingcommunityWORKSHOP that uses GIS-
based mapping and community engagement to 
drive smart, equitable, and impactful investment 
in green assets to improve the city’s social, 
environmental, and economic resilience.

Smart Growth  
for Dallas

  Recognize and 

6A

institutionalize the need  
for a multi-pronged, 

 
 
coordinated, place-based approach 
and the long-term commitment 
necessary to achieve holistic 
revitalization in low- and moderate-
income neighborhoods.

nonprofit working to bring high-quality 
parks, trails, and green spaces within a 
10-minute walk of every Dallas resident. The 
organization is helping the City integrate data 
into sustainable public policy solutions to our 
most pressing environmental health issues.

What is the Market Value Analysis? 
A data-based tool to assist policymakers, 
residents, and other stakeholders in 
understanding the local residential real 
estate market and inform City policy 
around housing program design, 
production levels, and incentives.

Dallas Leading  
the Way

Dallas has been an environmental leader in 
North Texas for decades. In the 1960s, the 
City conducted the first emissions inventory for 
the region, and today has the largest and most 
robust local air program in Texas. In June 2017, 
Mayor Rawlings joined 392 U.S. Climate Mayors 
to pledge Dallas would honor its commitment to 
improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions 
in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement.

Dallas Bond Program

In November 2017, Dallas voters approved a 
$1.05 billion Bond Program to address critical 
infrastructure needs, including upgrades to the 
city’s aging traffic signals and drainage projects 
to control flooding and erosion. Bond funds 
will also pay for quality of life improvements 
such as new parks and recreation facilities.

What is a place-based approach?  
Bottom-up approach to community 
development that aims to address the unique 
needs of a neighborhood―such as poor 
housing, social isolation, poor or fragmented 
service provision, or limited economic 
opportunities―by collaborating with people at 
the local level to identify the best resources.

6A.2 Create a cross-departmental 
committee with executive-level leadership 
and representation from the Department of 
Housing and Neighborhood Revitalization, the 
Department of Public Works, the Department 
of Transportation, the Department of Code 
Enforcement, the Office of Economic 
Development, the Office of Fair Housing, 
the Office of Environmental Quality, the 
Office of Homeless Solutions, the Office of 
Community Care, and the Office of Resilience 
to establish common goals, strategies, and 
actions that address the disparities and 
adverse community conditions (economic, 
social, physical, and environmental) present 
in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.

The Nature Conservancy

The Nature Conservancy is leading the effort 
to solve Dallas’ most pressing environmental 
health challenges. During the last six months, 
the Conservancy brought together more 
than 50 community leaders in identifying 
four problem areas: air quality, urban heat, 
water quality and quantity, and access to 
green space. In line with its vision of a “cool, 
clean, resilient Dallas,” the Conservancy and 
its core partners―the City of Dallas, Texas Trees 
Foundation and The Trust for Public Land―are 
now developing a framework to address these 
issues comprehensively and collaboratively.

Laura Huffman 
The Nature Conservancy 
Laura Huffman is state director for The Nature 
Conservancy in Texas and founding director of 
the Conservancy’s North America Cities program, 
created to support cities as they integrate natural 
infrastructure into local planning and development. 

Dr. Kathy Jack 
The Nature Conservancy 
Dr. Kathy Jack has more than 15 years of 
experience using environmental technology 
to identify nature-based solutions to resource 
problems―energy, food and water. As 
Dallas Urban Conservation Associate, 
Dr. Jack has mobilized public, private, 
and nonprofit partners, to engage in this 
problem-solving effort at a citywide level.

7A.2 Work with The Nature Conservancy, 
Trust for Public Land, and Texas A&M AgriLife 
Research to compile existing flooding and 
drainage analyses across the City into a 
comprehensive map to identify gaps and 
nature-based solutions to reduce flooding.

Dallas is home to EarthX, the world’s largest 
annual environmental expo, conference and film 
festival. Environmentalist and business man 
Trammell S. Crow founded EarthX as Earth 
Day Texas in 2011 to promote environmental 
awareness and action. Now a global platform, 
EarthX2018 convened approximately 
138,000 participants, 700 exhibitors and 400 
speakers, representing business, government, 
nonprofits and academia, from nearly every 
state and 20 countries, to collaborate on 
sustainable solutions for a resilient world.

GOALS AND INITIATIVESEQUITY
INDICATORS

RESILIENT DALLAS

50

EQUITYThe Dallas Equity Indicators project was developed 
in collaboration with the City University of New York’s 
Institute for State and Local Governance (CUNY ISLG) and 
the University of Texas at Dallas’ Institute for Urban Policy 
Research (UTD IUPR) as a comprehensive tool to help 
Dallas understand and measure equity in our community.

The Equity Indicators tool is designed to measure 
disparities faced by marginalized or disadvantaged 
groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, 
or individuals living in poverty, and whether those 
disparities are improving or worsening. Disparity is 
measured across six thematic areas: Economic 
Opportunity, Education, Housing and Neighborhood 
Quality, Justice and Government, Public Health, 
and Transportation and Infrastructure. 

The Equity Indicators will be used as a framework 
for residents, business and nonprofit leaders, City 
administrators, and elected officials to understand the 
power of governmental policy in providing opportunity to 
all residents. More importantly, this tool can demonstrate 
the effectiveness of current public policies and initiatives 
and highlight areas where new efforts may be needed 
to ensure all residents have access to opportunities 
to improve their lives and provide for their families.

The indicators and findings will be publicly available so 
communities can hold the City accountable for its work 
in analyzing the current barriers to opportunity and its 
promises to advance equity and improve conditions 
for all its residents. The City is committed to increasing 
transparency through the annual measurement 
and publication of this data, which will provide a 
clear view into the disparities in our community.

August 8, 2018
WHEREAS, 100 Resilient Cities partners with cities around the world to help them 
become more resilient to the social, economic and physical challenges that are a 
growing part of the 21st century; and 

WHEREAS, urban resilience is defined as the capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt and grow despite 
chronic stresses and acute shocks; and 

WHEREAS, the City of Dallas, through stakeholder engagement, focus groups, data 
collection and geographic analysis, has identified resilience goals and initiatives 
to build upon areas of strength and to address weaknesses/needs throughout the 
community; and 

WHEREAS, a foundational principle of the Resilient Dallas plan is building an 
Equitable Dallas; and 

WHEREAS, the first resilience goal is to advance equity in City government; and 

WHEREAS, an analysis of city programs and administration will lead to greater 
equity in service delivery, strategic planning and budget allocation; and 

WHEREAS, leading by example will enable the City of Dallas to engage its partner 
institutions and neighborhood organizations to address areas of inequality such as 
childhood poverty, access to quality education, transportation, housing, and greater 
participation in our robust economy; and 

WHEREAS, implementation of equity initiatives and actions will allow the city 
to measure progress toward achieving greater equity in Dallas and move the 
community toward increased resilience. 

Now, Therefore, 

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF DALLAS: 

SECTION 1. That the Dallas City Council accepts the specific goals, initiatives and 
actions set forth in the Resilient Dallas Plan. 

SECTION 2. That the City Manager is directed to move forward with these initiatives 
to further the goals of resilience and equity within the City of Dallas. 

SECTION 3. That this resolution shall take effect immediately from and after its 
passage in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the City of Dallas, and it 
is accordingly so resolved.
