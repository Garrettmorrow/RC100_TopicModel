FOREWORD
LAWRENCE WONG, 
MINISTER FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND 
SECOND MINISTER FOR FINANCE, SINGAPORE
Singapore has come a long way in transforming into a liveable 
and  resilient  city.  In  the  1960s,  living  conditions  were  far 
from  ideal.  We  were  subjected  to  multiple  urban  challenges 
including poor public health conditions, lack of quality housing, 
low connectivity across the island and employment insecurity. 

The  situation  is  very  different  today.  The  quality  of  life  in 
Singapore  has  significantly  improved—everyone  has  access 
to a clean and green environment, and to live in an inclusive 
society with opportunities for all. 

As a small city-state with limited natural resources, we were 
keenly aware of the need to adapt and evolve to our constantly 
changing circumstances. Hence, we focus on long-term urban 
planning, and develop contingency plans for different scenarios. 
We do all this in a holistic, integrated manner, working across 
different  sectors  and  more  importantly,  involving  different 
stakeholders to create a sustainable and liveable Singapore. 

Beyond robust physical infrastructure, resilience is also about 
working  closely  with  our  communities  and  stakeholders.  For 
example,  in  providing  affordable  and  quality  public  housing 
in  Singapore,  we  not  only  build  the  flats,  but  also  develop 
programmes  to  bring  residents  closer  together  and  foster 
strong  community  bonds.  Through  this  process,  neighbours 
can forge deeper support networks which can be counted on 
during times of need. 

Similarly, our approach to managing water is more than just a 
supply issue. We saw an opportunity to innovate and grow our 
water industries, and create beautiful blue-green recreational 
spaces  through  efforts  such  as  the  Active,  Beautiful, 
Clean  (ABC)  Waters  Programme  and  the  Park  Connector  
Network (PCN). 

We have achieved much, but there is still more that needs to be 
done. Building an increasingly resilient Singapore is an ongoing 
journey, where the results hinge on the combined efforts of the 
government, our communities and stakeholders.

MESSAGE FROM CENTRE 
FOR LIVEABLE CITIES (CLC) 
KHOO TENG CHYE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CLC
It would have been hard to imagine that Singapore, a basket 
case  of  urbanisation  back  in  the  1960s–with  urban  slums, 
poor infrastructure and lack of sanitation–would make the leap 
to  a  thriving  city-state  in  the  space  of  50  years,  let  alone  be 
considered a highly liveable city. 

Indeed, our transformation into a highly sustainable and liveable 
city-state while being one of the most densely populated cities 
with limited natural resources is a story of resilience. We built 
strong  communities  and  overcame  racial  riots  in  the  early 
years; fostered strong social cohesion through the way we plan 
and build our housing estates; established a clean and green 
Singapore;  overcame  our  water  scarcity  by  establishing  4 
National Taps; and built multi-functional infrastructure such as 
the Marina Barrage. All these and the rest of the case studies 
outlined in this publication are examples of how resilience is 
embodied in the Singapore journey.

Singapore’s  development  model  of  high  density  and  high  
liveability  has  been  a  subject  of  interest  for  many.  Even  so, 
we  are  also  continuously  learning  from  other  cities  and 
how  Singapore  can  do  better  to  further  build  our  resilience, 
sustainability and liveability. This is why the Centre for Liveable 
Cities  was  inspired  to  join  the  100  Resilient  Cities  Network 
to  learn  from  other  cities  in  the  network,  as  well  as  share 
Singapore’s experience. 

As cities continue to grow and urbanise in the face of global 
uncertainties  and  complex  challenges,  resilience  is  key.  In 
Singapore’s experience, resilience is not just about being able 
to recover after times of crisis. Resilience is continuously built 
through  integrated  and  long-term  planning  and  good  urban 
governance. This has allowed us to build a Singapore that can 
survive, adapt and thrive regardless of the stresses and shocks 
we face. 

This  publication  has  utilised 
the  Singapore  Liveability 
Framework,  which  distils  the  key  principles  of  Singapore’s 
urban transformation, and 100 Resilient Cities’ City Resilience 
Framework, to capture how Singapore has gone about building 
resilience.  The  publication  has  focused  on  two  pertinent 
resilience  challenges  of  climate  change  and  changing 
demographics and the ongoing efforts and future actions to 
address them. 

The  Centre  for  Liveable  Cities  looks  forward  to  continue 
working  with  100  Resilient  Cities  to  learn  from  its  network 
of  cities  and  share  Singapore’s  experience  with  others.  The 
collective  knowledge  and  experience  will  most  definitely  go 
towards helping Singapore and other cities better understand 
resilience  challenges  and  find  innovative  urban  solutions  to 
tackle them.

MESSAGE FROM 100 
RESILIENT CITIES (100RC) 
MICHAEL BERKOWITZ, PRESIDENT, 100RC  
Singapore’s story is one that demonstrates the importance of 
resilience  thinking  for  cities.  Singapore’s  transformation  over 
the past five decades has been remarkable–from a fledgling 
nation  state  plagued  by  pollution,  corruption,  social  unrest, 
and  other  urban  challenges  to  a  clean,  safe,  liveable  and 
sustainable city today. That transformation towards resilience 
was  achieved  through  a  rigorous  commitment  to  integrated 
planning and to constantly reimagining the city as it could be 
and as it should be in the near and far term. What is just as 
important is the commitment that Singapore has put in place 
to  ensure  that  plans  come  to  fruition  and  stakeholders  are 
engaged in the process. 

it  gained 

independence,  Singapore  has 

Since 
taken 
an 
integrated,  and  strategic  approach  to  creating  and 
implementing its plans. By developing plans with both 50-year 
and 10-year time horizons and designing multiple benefits into 
every intervention, Singapore has become a living lab for the 
value of resilience thinking.  Projects like Marina Barrage and 
Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park could have focused on singular goals–
to increase fresh water reserves and improve storm drainage–
but delivered multiple benefits including improving biodiversity, 
reducing flooding, creating recreational space, reducing urban 
heat island effect and improving community cohesion. 

In this Resilience Narrative, Singapore has documented how it 
has been successful in implementing its resilience plans and 
overcoming its challenges.  But it has also asked some difficult 
questions and recognised continued challenges that will shape 
Singapore’s future.  The two challenges of climate change and 
changing demographics that Singapore has identified resonate 
with  many  cities  around  the  world.  This  publication  outlines 
what Singapore can and needs to do to further its resilience 
when dealing with such challenges. 

Resilience  is  an  ongoing  process  of  reflection,  engagement 
and  innovation.  Nowhere  is  this  stated  more  clearly  than 
in  the  final  call  to  action  of  this  document–a  shift  towards 
a  values-based  society,  a  call  for  the  whole  city  to  come 
together  in  good  times  and  bad.    Singapore  holds  a  special 
place as the only nation state in the 100RC network.  But in 
many ways here again, Singapore is tackling challenges that 
many  cities  will  eventually  have  to  face–how  to  survive  and 
thrive  as  a  city  in  an  increasingly  connected  global  context.  
I look forward to continuing our work with Singapore through 
the Centre for Liveable Cities on these challenges. Singapore 
has the potential to be a valuable contributor not only to our 
network but to all cities around the world on building resilience, 
planning for uncertainty and optimising resources.  I hope this 
document  can  be  instructive  and  a  starting  point  for  deeper 
global collaboration on important issues impacting cities today.

EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY

09

poor 

Singapore’s  journey  is  as  much  a  story  of 
sustainable  urban  development  as  it  is  of 
resilience. Just barely 50 years ago, a newly 
independent Singapore had to grapple with 
serious  urban  challenges—overcrowded 
slums, 
public 
health  conditions  as  well  as  inadequate 
infrastructure to meet a growing population. 
Then, we were less than two million people. 
Today,  our  population  is  more  than  5.6 
million without significant increases in our 
land  area.  Even  as  our  population  tripled, 
we have become more liveable as a city.

sanitation 

and 

Resilience  has  been  embedded  in  our  efforts  to  develop 
Singapore into a liveable and sustainable city. In taking a long-
term and integrated approach to planning and developing our 
city, we have been building up our resilience and capacity to 
manage and adapt to stresses and putting in place different 
measures to handle potential shocks. Given our context as a 
globally  connected,  high-density  city-state  with  limited  land 
and  resources,  our  perennial  stresses  can  easily  spiral  into 
larger problems or become amplified in times of crises if not 
well-managed. 

In  our  early  years,  we  provided  basic  necessities  and 
infrastructure,  such  as  public  housing  and  clean  water,  and 

built  our  economy,  without  compromising  our  sustainability 
and liveability. We worked with  different stakeholders to build 
inclusive  public  spaces,  conserve  our  nature  reserves  and 
protect our greenery, while reserving spaces for the arts and 
many more. 

With  increasing  globalisation  and  urbanisation,  Singapore, 
as  with  many  other  cities  around  the  world  today,  continues 
to  face  increasingly  complex  urban  challenges.  Resilience 
thinking is not a luxury but a necessity  for cities. It is about 
putting  in  place  holistic  and  integrated  measures  to  enable 
cities to adapt, survive, and thrive regardless of the stresses or 
shocks they face. 

The  Centre  for  Liveable  Cities  (CLC)  and  100  Resilient  Cities 
(100RC)—Pioneered  by  Rockefeller  Foundation,  have  put 
together this publication to share Singapore’s resilience story 
of building a highly liveable and sustainable city, and how we 
are  continuing  to  build  resilience  in  an  increasingly  complex 
environment. Through research and a series of engagements 
with various stakeholders from the public, private, and people 
sectors,  we  have  identified  key  case  studies  and  insights  on 
Singapore’s  efforts  to  build  resilience,  focusing  in  particular 
on  two  key  cross-cutting  challenges:  Climate  Change  and 
Changing Demographics. 

Building  resilience  is  an  ongoing  process.  What  matters  is 
to learn from what we have done and achieved and to learn 
from others. More importantly, it is about how the whole city 
can come together, both in the day-to-day and during times of 
crises. We need to move from awareness to action. Everyone 
has a part to play in this continued commitment to building a 
resilient Singapore.

SINGAPORE: 
A JOURNEY OF 
RESILIENCE

OUR URBAN TRANSFORMATION 

In 1947, the British Housing Committee Report proclaimed that 
Singapore “had one of the world’s worst slums—a disgrace to a  
civilised community”.1

The British colony then had a population of less than one million 
people,  more  than  half  of  which  lived  in  dirty,  overcrowded 
slums.  Singapore  was  plagued  by  various  urban  challenges, 
and  there  was  a  dire  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  with  poor 
drainage  and  sanitation,  polluted  rivers,  and  a  lack  of  clean, 
piped water. As a result, malnutrition and disease were rife, as 
was the prevalence of water and food borne diseases such as 
tuberculosis and cholera. Life expectancy was short, and infant 
mortality was high.

Today,  Singapore  ranks  25th  on  the  Mercer  Liveability  Index. 
We  have  the  third  highest  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP) 
per capita and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the 
world. As our population tripled over the past 50 years, we have 
become a highly dense but liveable and sustainable city-state 
that offers our residents a high quality of life.2 

This transformation of Singapore since our independence from 
1965 is very much a story of resilience. 

We  have  come  a  long  way,  but  we  cannot  afford  to  be 
complacent  or 
forward 
builds  upon  our  past  as  we  continuously  strive  to  further  
our resilience. 

remain  stagnant.  Our 

journey 

A city that fails to plan, plans 
to fail. With the emergence 
and continued existence of 

challenges that are increasingly 
global and complex, continuing 

the resilience journey in 
Singapore is critical.

CHRONIC STRESSES 
ACUTE SHOCKS 

Our Perennial Stresses

Learning from Shocks

As  a  small  city-state,  Singapore’s  plans  are  often  dealt  with 
at the national level. We have to fit in the needs of a nation, 
including  catering  for  military  training  grounds,  defence 
airbases, sea ports, airports, water catchment areas, industrial 
zones and more while ensuring the well-being of a highly dense 
population. These are not typically expected of a city and they 
constantly add additional pressure on us. 

As a small island constrained by limited natural resources, we 
have to constantly find innovative ways to balance competing 
land requirements to meet our different economic, social, and 
environmental needs. 

Oftentimes, stresses that are not managed well can spiral into 
larger incidents such as riots, financial crises or infrastructural 
accidents. When facing incidents beyond our control, what we 
have done to prepare ourselves will also impact on how well 
we can cope.   

While  Singapore  has  fortunately  avoided  major  natural 
disasters,  we  have  had  our  fair  share  of  shocks  over  the 
years.  Every  incident  is  an  opportunity  to  learn  and  adapt, 
ensuring  that  systems  are  in  place  for  us  to  prevent  or 
mitigate  and  recover  better  when  faced  with  recurring  or  
new shocks.

SUDDEN INDEPENDENCE
—Separation from Malaysia

In  1965,  Singapore  suddenly  found  itself  an  independent  nation  with 
the  separation  from  Malaysia.  Without  a  hinterland,  we  had  to  deal 
with issues of sovereignty, defence and economic survival. This was 
compounded in 1967 when the British administration announced the 
withdrawal of its military bases here, which accounted for a significant 
proportion of Singapore’s economy then. 

One of the most pressing issues we faced was ensuring the security 
of our border. A new Ministry of Foreign Affairs was formed, as well 
as  a  People’s  Defence  Force. This  was  followed  by  the  expansion  of 
the Singapore Armed Forces through mandatory conscription of male 
citizens  through  National  Service  in  1967.  The  same  year,  a  Bases 
Economic  Conversion  Department  was  also  set  up  to  convert  British 
bases for commercial uses to avoid large-scale unemployment.

2003 CONTAINING A PANDEMIC

—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Outbreak in Singapore 

15
15

By the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) termed the previously 
unknown virus as SARS on 15 March 2003, some 82 people in Singapore 
had already been infected. The city’s economy also suffered as fears 
of  the  virus  impacted  tourism  and  streets  were  emptied  as  people  
stayed indoors. 

Within two and a half months, the outbreak was successfully contained 
and Singapore was declared free of SARS on 30 May 2003. However, in 
that short period, the city had a total of 238 reported cases, including 
33 deaths. 

We  were  able  to  quickly  contain  the  pandemic  because  of  strong 
measures that addressed the issues on multiple fronts, including:

—Dealing with the Haze Episode

In  2013,  Singapore  was  hit  by  one  of  our  worst  haze  incidents  since 
1997. The haze, which enveloped the city in mid-July, was caused by 
forest fires from neighbouring Indonesia. Haze levels reached Pollution 
Standards  Index  (PSI)  of  400  on  21  July,  a  critical  level  deemed  to 
be  “potentially  life  threatening  to  the  ill  and  elderly”  by  the  National 
Environment Agency (NEA). 

Some of the measures that were rapidly adapted in Singapore to deal 
with the haze included: 

• 

Integrated national level coordination:  A Crisis Management Group 
(Haze) meeting was convened by the Permanent Secretary of the 
Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) to lead 
and coordinate government responses. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Integrated  and  coordinated  national-level  responses  that  were 
led by the high-level Executive Group formed to lead government-  
wide  responses  to  contain  the  virus  and  address  the  socio-
economic impacts.

Rapid and effective mobilisation of different groups from various 
sectors,  including  the  military,  healthcare  and  grassroots,  to 
work  tirelessly  and  closely  together  to  contain  the  virus.  This 
included  contact  tracing;  monitoring  and  screening;  campaigning 
to  keep  hygiene  standard  high  in  public  spaces;  and  boosting  
public confidence.

Ground-level  initiatives  among  the  public  and  community,  e.g. 
neighbours sending food and groceries to those under quarantine.

Rapid  integrated  crisis  management  responses:  The  Ministry  of 
Health  subsidised  treatment  of  haze-related  ailment  for  needy 
patients  at  private  clinics,  while  the  Singapore  Armed  Forces, 
together  with  grassroots  volunteers,  were  mobilised  by  the 
People’s Association to distribute N95 masks to 200,000 vulnerable 
households. 

Community  level  responses: The  wider  community  also  stepped  up 
and reached out to vulnerable groups. Members of the public bought 
masks to distribute to needy families, and some even offered to house 
neighbours in their air-conditioned rooms.

OVERCOMING

TO CREATE A 
SUSTAINABLE 
ENVIRONMENT

MAINTAINING 
A MULTI-CULTURAL 
AND DIVERSE CITY

Singapore’s strategic location in Asia has made us a gateway for multinational 
companies to enter the region’s emerging markets. This is supported by our pro-
business, world-class financial infrastructure, and a well-developed transportation 
hub  that  is  home  to  one  of  the  world’s  busiest  sea  and  air  ports.  Singapore  
also has a skilled workforce, a result of efforts to develop people, our best and  
only resource. 

Without a hinterland, Singapore has strived to keep an open and well-connected 
economy  over  the  past  five  decades.  While  strong  trading  ties  with  other 
countries  have  helped  us  prosper,  this  strength  also  makes  us  vulnerable  to 
global  economic,  political,  and  social  stressors  and  uncertainties.  It  is  critical 
that we remain highly flexible and nimble in the global economy, providing a safe, 
conducive, and liveable space to attract continued investments and talent.

With  limited  land  and  resources,  Singapore  has  placed  great  emphasis  on 
sustainable development since our formative years, rejecting the “develop first, 
clean  up  later”  approach.  Rather  than  treating  environmental  protection  as  
being at odds with economic development, we see both as an integral part of 
city planning and development. In our early days, having a clean and green city 
demonstrated to foreign investors that we were well-run and safe—key factors 
that distinguished us from other cities and countries in the region. 

Although surrounded by water, we are one of the world’s most water-stressed 
countries. In our earlier years, water rationing had to be imposed during periods 
of  drought.  Monsoon  periods  led  to  flooding  due  to  intense  rainfall.  Despite 
these perennial stresses, since 1979, Singapore had provided 100% access to 
clean, portable water to all its people and has reduced our flood prone areas to a 
mere 32 ha in 2015. Beyond the provision of clean water, we have also bolstered 
our water capacity with "4 National Taps": water from local water catchments, 
imported  water  from  Malaysia,  NEWater  (high-grade  reclaimed  water);  and 
desalinated water.

As  a  small  city-state  with  no  natural  resources,  bringing  together  Singapore’s 
multi-ethnic, multi-religious society has been fundamental to our development. 
Founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once shared that the biggest challenge for 
Singapore was “how to build a nation out of a disparate collection of immigrants 
from China, British India and the Dutch East Indies”4. Today, diversity continues 
to be a hallmark of Singapore, with an ever growing foreign population attracted 
to live, work, and study here.  

Our evolving demographic is going to challenge and stress the capacity of the 
city-state. In addition, an ageing population will impact the workforce and the 
economic dynamism of the city-state. It is critical that Singapore continues to 
engage  our  population  and  adapt  to  changes  to  ensure  a  healthy  and  happy 
populace.  This  means  not  just  engaging  and  mitigating  potential  fault  lines 
within the society, but also fostering a more cohesive community to play a key 
role in social support and rapport in times of troubles.

DEVELOPING OUR  
LIVEABLE AND RESILIENT CITY 

is 

the  capacity  of 

Resilience 
individuals,  communities, 
institutions,  businesses  and  systems  within  a  city  to  survive, 
adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and 
acute shocks they experience. 

For Singapore, resilience is embedded in our pursuit of a liveable 
and sustainable city, ensuring that we can continue and better 
our path of development regardless of the shocks and stresses 
we face. We have done so by constantly balancing competing 
demands  of  developing  a  competitive  economy,  building  a 
sustainable environment, and ensuring a high quality of life for 
our population.

This is expressed in the Singapore Liveability Framework, which 
captures the liveable city outcomes of a competitive economy, 
a high quality of life and a sustainable environment; and the 
approach  to  achieving  these  outcomes  through  integrated 
master planning and dynamic urban governance.

Integrated Master Planning

Singapore’s  integrated  master  planning  system  has  enabled 
the  government  to  create  and  manage  urban  systems  that 
balances the different priorities of the city. Integrated master 
planning  goes  beyond  the  drafting  of  physical  plans.  We 
look  at  optimising  planning  decisions  such  that  policies  and 
plans  can  meet  both  short-term  and  long-term  needs,  and 
respond to the changes of a dynamic political, economic, and  
social environment.

Dynamic Urban Governance

The  challenge  for  most  cities  is  in  translating  plans  and 
strategies effectively and efficiently into reality. Singapore does 
this by having the necessary systems and processes in place 
based on accountability, transparency, and incorruptibility. 

Oftentimes,  the  political  leadership  in  Singapore  sets  a  clear 
direction and rallies people from the public, private, and people 
sectors.  With  the  proper  systems  and  sound  institutions  in 
place, different government agencies cooperate and work with 
stakeholders from multiple sectors to implement and execute 
policies and programmes that foster growth and improve lives.

to  50  years  of  development,  and  these  are  translated 
into  the  Master  Plan—a  detailed  and  granular  statutory 
plan  that  is  used  to  guide  development  over  the  next  10  
to 15 years. 

Singapore’s  Concept  and  Master  Plans  embody  the  key

in  nature,  the  Concept  Plan  establishes 
and

the  vision  for 
land-use  and  transport  for  the  next  40 

As  a  city-state  that  has  to  factor  in  considerations  at  both 
the  city  and  national  levels,  a  comprehensive  governance 
approach  involving  different  stakeholders  is  in  place  to 
coordinate policy, planning, and implementations.

Concept Plan

Singapore’s  first  Concept  Plan,  completed  in  1971,  guided 
development of new towns, transport infrastructure and other 
aspects  of  urban  development  while  safeguarding  long-term 
land-use needs. The Concept Plan is reviewed every 10 years to 
address changes in social and economic needs, with mid-term 
reviews being carried out when necessary. Embedded within 
the  Concept  Plan  process  is  a  consultative  process  where 
feedback  from  the  public  are  sought  through  detailed  focus 
groups as well as platforms such as surveys, public forums, 
and exhibitions. This is coordinated by the Ministry of National 
Development (MND) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority 
(URA), the national authority for land-use planning.

long-term 

Such 
integrated  planning  builds  resilience  as 
planners  consider  how  decisions  deemed  convenient  now 

might not lead to results beneficial to us in the long-term. This 
means embarking on projects that do not seem pressing at the 
moment but would be important in the future. Such a long-term 
view also enables planners to identify possible problems in the 
future and take steps earlier to pre-empt them. 

The  involvement  of  multiple  agencies  through  inter-agency 
efforts also ensures that all key land-use requirements of the 
city are met and individual systems such as transport, water 
or public housing are not decided in isolation. This integrated 
approach involving more than 20 government ministries and 
agencies in drafting Concept Plans is an important element in 
building resilience.

21

Urban Governance

Acutely aware of our limited land and resources, we understand 
the need for coordination and integration across the different 
agencies involved in developing Singapore. 

Emphasis  has  been  on  integrating  and  creating  synergies 
across different urban systems and domain areas, and ensuring 
its integrity. Ultimately, incorruptibility and professionalism are 
key elements that we hold steadfast to and these have been 
key contributors to our rapid success and development.

Effective  implementation  is  key  to  governance.  For  example, 
in the early days, given the urgency of combatting air pollution, 
the Anti-Pollution Unit was formed under the Prime Minister's 
Office in 1970 to combat the urgent issue of air pollution. When 
looking  at  cross-cutting  issues  such  as  climate  change  and 

security,  platforms for a whole-of-government approach such as  
the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change are in place 
today to ensure that we look at issues and approach them in a 
holistic manner.

On  top  of  coordinating  and  delivering  effective  and  efficient 
solutions  and  outcomes  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  the 
population  and  beyond,  what  has  been  critical  is  also  the 
level  of  trust  built  with  the  people  through  both  working  for 
and  with  them.  Most  of  Singapore’s  plans  and  initiatives 
actively  engage  the  community  and  stakeholders.  We  have 
held  nation-wide  engagements  such  as  Our  Singapore  
Conversation  (OSC)  and  strategic  reviews  such  as  the 
Committee  for  Future  Economy  which  reviewed  Singapore's 
economic strategies for the future.

RESILIENCE 
MATTERS

Today,  the  Earth  is  getting  hotter,  the  sea  is  rising,  and 
the  climate  is  changing.  The  scale  of  globalisation  and 
urbanisation is impacting our economy and society. The pace 
of demographic change is impacting many aspects of city life. 
In short, Singapore and cities around the world are facing an 
ever-increasingly complex environment.

Many  tend  to  think  of  resilience  as  building  robust  critical 
infrastructure  or  factoring  redundancy  into  systems,  such  as 
having  strategically  located  back-up  power  generators  in  the 
City Resilience
Framework

case of power outages or failures. But we need more than that. 
We  need  to  understand  and  consider  the  interdependencies 
between the urban systems of our city. 

We need to recognise that people and communities are also at 
the heart of resilience. This means fostering a whole-of-society 
approach: enabling and supporting our stakeholders to deal with 
the evolving challenges of today and tomorrow.

WHAT MAKES A CITY RESILIENT?  

100  Resilient  Cities  (100RC)  articulates  the  dimensions 
and  drivers  needed  to  build  resilience  via  its  City  Resilience 
Framework (CRF). This framework outlines four dimensions of 
Health and Wellbeing; Economy and Society; Infrastructure and 
Environment;  and  Leadership  and  Strategy  as  well  as  twelve 
drivers that contribute to resilience and the multiple entry points  
for actions. 

The CRF provides a lens to understand the complexity of cities 
and  the  drivers  that  contribute  to  its  resilience.  Cities  can 
assess the extent of their resilience using the CRF and identify 
critical  areas  for  improvements,  interdependencies  between 
systems, and potential actions to further the city's resilience. 

Building  a  city’s  resilience  means  creating  systems  that  are 
designed to withstand, respond to, and adapt more readily to 
shocks and stresses. 100RC has built on decades of research 
on resilient systems to identify seven qualities that various city 
systems need.

Resilience  is  not  just  about  emergency  preparedness  or  the 
ability  to  recover  after  disasters  or  crises.  A  key  element  of 
resilience, particularly for Singapore, is also about making the 
city better in good times to benefit all, and in the process, build   
capacity to deal with crises when they do happen.

The  Marina  Barrage  in  Singapore  is  one  example  of  achieving  multiple  resilience 
dividends.5 It helps to alleviate flooding in the low-lying areas in the city and also serves 
as the first fresh-water reservoir in the heart of the city. Besides this water management 
function, the barrage has been designed as a recreational community space for all to 
enjoy. The reservoir's constant water level also makes it ideal for various water sports 
such as dragon-boating, kayaking, and sailing.

WRITING OUR RESILIENCE STORY 

In  developing  this  publication,  the  Centre  for  Liveable  Cities 
(CLC) conducted a number of stakeholder interviews and stock-
taking and analysis exercises to capture Singapore’s past and 
current efforts in building resilience, and identify areas for further 
discussion and future action. These were done and facilitated by 
100RC's City Resilience Framework (CRF).

Setting the Agenda and Learning from 100RC's Network

CLC kick-started the process with an Agenda-Setting Workshop 
to  identify  key  resilience  challenges  and  gaps  in  Singapore. 
The  discussions  with  stakeholders  from  key  government 
agencies  and  the  people  and  private  sectors  concluded  that 
while Singapore has done well in building resilience in many 
areas,  more  could  be  done  to  empower  a  broader  range  of 
stakeholders and foster stronger communities.

Leveraging on 100RC’s Network, the Chief Resilience Officers 
(CROs)  of  Melbourne  and  Bangkok  shared  their  experiences 
and efforts in developing their city's  resilience strategies. Amy 
Chester,  Managing  Director  from  Rebuild  by  Design  (RBD)6, 
also shared with the workshop about the RBD project and the 
value of applying a collaborative research and design process. 

Taking Stock of Existing Work

Engaging the Wider Community

Utilising 100RC's tools, such as the Action Inventory tool and the 
Perception Assessment tool, CLC also reviewed and captured 
the wide range of initiatives and programmes that are and have 
been in place to build resilience in Singapore. 

In a second workshop, CLC again brought together stakeholders 
from  the  public,  people,  and  private  sectors  to  identify  gaps, 
opportunities,  and  actions,  and  agreed  to  focus  on  two  key 
challenges of climate change and changing demographics.

OUR RESILIENCE 
CHALLENGES

As Singapore grew into a densely-populated city-state, the type 
of stresses and shocks we are exposed to have also evolved. 
We  cannot  assume  Singapore  to  be  sheltered  from  what  is 
happening  around  the  world,  nor  can  we  simply  replicate 
solutions from the past for current and future challenges. Our 
approach to today's issues has to be integrated and holistic, 
based  on  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  interdependencies 
between different sectors and domains.

TWO KEY CHALLENGES

A  Resilient  Singapore  has 
identified  two  key  resilience 
challenges:  Climate  Change  and  Changing  Demographics. 
Both have significant impacts across different sectors, some of 
which—such as the occurrence of flash floods and the brewing 
undercurrents of social tensions—are already apparent today.

27

Surviving and Thriving in a World Where the Climate 
is Changing

By dint of our geographical location, Singapore is fortunate to 
have  avoided  the  direct  impacts  of  natural  disasters,  such  as 
hurricanes and earthquakes. Nevertheless, we remain extremely 
vulnerable to climate change. 

There are three main areas of concern:  First, as a small, low-lying 
island-state,  Singapore  faces  an  existential  threat  from  rising  
sea levels. Experts estimate that sea levels around Singapore 
could  rise  by  up  to  1m  by  the  end  of  the  century.  If  left 
unaddressed,  low-lying  coastal  regions  in  Singapore  could 
experience  flooding  during  severe  coastal  storms,  or  even 
become permanently submerged over time.   

Second,  daily  mean  temperatures  are  projected  to  rise  by 
1.4 to 4.6°C towards the end of this century. This can aid the 

proliferation  of  vector-borne  diseases  such  as  Dengue  and 
Zika; cause crop failure in the countries from which we import 
food; and harm our biodiversity. For example, high sea surface 
temperatures  were  responsible  for  coral  bleaching  from  1998 
to 2010. In 2015, hot weather caused a plankton bloom in the 
Johor Straits resulting in mass fish deaths.

Third,  the  contrast  between  the  wet  months  (November  to 
January) and dry months (Febuary and June to September) are 
likely to become more pronounced. An increase in intense rainfall 
can  lead  to  flash  floods.  Conversely,  a  lack  of  rainfall  poses 
threats to our water supplies. In 2014, Singapore experienced 
a  record  dry  spell  of  27  days. The  drier  weather  in  2015  and 
2016 caused water levels at Linggiu Reservoir in Johor (which 
Singapore imports water from) to drop to a historic low (about 
20%  in  October  2016).  To  remain  resilient,  Singapore’s  water 
security and flood prevention plans need to be able to cope with 
the impact of changing weather patterns. 

WATER RESOURCES  
AND DRAINAGE
•  A persistent lack of rainfall or prolonged  
 
dry spell could place our water resources  
 
under pressure 
• 
 

Intense rainfall could overwhelm our drainage  
system and lead to flash floods

vector-borne diseases

PUBLIC HEALTH 
•  Warmer periods can increase the risk of  
 
•  Warmer weather may also lead to more  
 
 
 

occurrences of heat stress and heat-induced  
illnesses, particularly among the very young,  
elderly and infirm. 

COASTAL PROTECTION
•  Areas along Singapore’s coast are at risk of coastal  
inundation given that about 30% of our island is less  
 
 
than 5m above mean sea level .

BIODIVERSITY 
& GREENERY

Changes to the climate, such as rising 
sea surface temperatures, rising sea 
levels and more intense rainfall, can 
adversely affect our flora and fauna.

FOOD SECURITY 
•  As we import more than 90% of our food, we are  
 
 

vulnerable to fluctuations in global food supply and  
prices, which may be affected by climate change.

28

Adapting to Changing Demographics

As a nation of immigrants, Singapore has a strong commitment 
to multiculturalism borne from hard lessons in the lead up to our 
independence. A series of racial riots in 1964 remind us of the 
need  to  build  a  socially  cohesive  city  and  we  have  supported 
the integration of diverse groups of people through a variety of 
approaches, such as developing common shared spaces. 

above, a demographic shift that will impact both our economy 
and  society.  With  the  projected  decline  of  the  population  of 
working-age  citizens  (aged  20-64),  we  need  to  maintain  a 
balanced inflow of immigrants and foreign workers, and keep 
raising productivity in order to maintain our economic dynamism 
and growth.

We know the future holds even more changes. As an open and 
global  hub,  Singapore  will  continue  to  attract  people  from  all 
over the world, making the city-state even more cosmopolitan 
and diverse. We also have a rapidly ageing population. By 2030, 
Singapore will have around 900,000 citizens aged 65 years and 

These  changing  demographics—a  sizeable  non-resident 
population  and  a  growing  elderly  population  with  increasing  
social  and  eldercare  needs—will  test  Singapore’s  social  
resilience.  We  will  need  to  continue  our  work  in  building  
communities  and  trust  in  this  multicultural,  multiracial,  and 
multi-religious city-state.

MORE THAN 
JUST THE 
ENVIRONMENT

From  early  on,  we  understood 
the 
importance  of  having  a  clean  and  green 
city  to  be  more  than  just  aesthetics.  We 
saw it as being key to convincing foreign 
investors that Singapore was well-planned 
and  sustainable.  It  was  also  important 
for the physical and mental well-being of  
the population. 

These  are  some  examples  of  how 
Singapore  has  built 
its  resilience  by 
taking  care  of  fundamentals.  Today’s  
development  should  not  come  at  the 
expense  of 
  our  current  and  future 
generations’ living environment.

CITY RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK (CRF):

01

Cleaning Up the City
Creating  a  clean  and  healthy  living  environment  were  key 
priorities for Singapore in the 1960s. Living conditions and public 
hygiene then were deplorable, and vector diseases were common 
occurrences. Any shocks—be it manmade or natural—often had 
a severe impact on the people.   

This was why the government placed significant emphasis on 
cleaning  and  greening  Singapore.  The  first  nationwide  public 
education programme—“Keep Singapore Clean”—was launched 
in 1968 to change public’s perception and behaviour with regard 
to cleanliness. Fines were imposed on individuals who littered, 
and competitions were held to rate schools, markets, community 
centres and government offices on their cleanliness. To lead by 
example, Member of Parliaments (MPs) and community leaders 
worked with residents to clean up common areas.

Singapore became one of the first countries in the world to have 
a  ministry  dedicated  to  the  environment  when  it  established 
the  Ministry  of  Environment  (ENV)  in  1972.  The  ministry 
took  a  systematic  and  integrated  approach  to  managing  the  
environment  by  setting  up  an  Environmental  Public  Health 
Division  to  look  after  public  hygiene,  while  the  Engineering 
Services Division provided and managed infrastructure such as 
sewerage,  drainage  and  solid  waste  management  systems  to 
safeguard and sustain the environment. 

02

Greening the City
Since our independence, the government recognised the value 
of providing people with access to greenery, as well as creating 
a pleasant and liveable environment for all. The pervasive green 
spaces in Singapore today was not by chance as greenery was 
put in place with infrastructure development. In 1963, then-Prime 
Minister Lee Kuan Yew launched the first tree planting campaign 
and set a target of planting 10,000 trees every year, with half of 
them  along  new  roads,  housing  estates,  school  grounds,  and  
car parks. 

Since  then,  Singapore  has  taken  an 
integrated  approach 
towards greening the city. In the 1970s, the Garden City Action 
Committee  was  formed  to  oversee  greening  efforts  across 
various  governmental  agencies. The  Parks  and Trees  Act  was 
enacted in 1975, mandating road codes that guarantee planting 
verges for trees along all roads, and requiring developers to set 
aside green buffers. More recently, the Master Plan of 2003 was 
released with the Parks and Water Bodies Plan and Identity Plan, 
which look to create an island-wide network of green and blue 
spaces. Between 23 July and 22 October 2002, public feedback 
was sought and incorporated in these plans.  

Despite  intense  urbanisation,  green  cover  in  Singapore  has 
increased  from  36%  in  1986  to  47%  in  2007.  Moving  beyond 
making greenery prevalent, Singapore also focused on bringing 
the community closer to it. To expand the network of greenery and 
enhance the use of these spaces, the Park Connector Network 
was created to connect discrete pockets of parks, open spaces 
and  waterways  with  tree-lined  walking  and  biking  paths  for  
the community.

Providing Clean Water
Another  key  aspect  of  resilience  for  Singapore  is  ensuring 
adequate  access  to  clean  water  for  the  population.  This  is 
crucial for the city-state’s survival and well-being. Despite being 
located in a tropical region, the lack of land to store water means 
Singapore is one of the countries with the greatest scarcity of 
freshwater in the world. In 2015, the World Resources Institute 
(WRI)  ranked  Singapore  as  one  of  the  most  water-stressed 
country in the world. 

PUB,  Singapore's  National  Water  Agency,  has  put  in  place  an 
integrated  water  management  system  that  ensures  a  robust 
and  diversified  water  supply  through  the  Four  National  Taps: 
local  catchment  water;  imported  water;  NEWater  (high-grade 
reclaimed water); and desalinated water. 

By 2060, Singapore’s water use is expected to more than double. 
To  meet  increasing  demand  and  strengthen  water  security, 
especially in the face of climate change, Singapore will continue 
to invest in key water infrastructure. A third desalination plant 
at Tuas will be completed in 2018, and two more desalination 
plants at Marina East and Jurong Island are being developed.

02

03

More Than Just a Barrage 
The Marina Barrage is a prime example of how Singapore has 
reaped  and  enjoyed  multiple  benefits  through  an  integrated 
development.  What  could  have  been  just  an  ugly  pump 
house  was  instead  designed  and  built—in  close  cooperation 
with  engineers  and  urban  planners—as  a  multi-purpose  and 
beautiful recreational space. The Marina Reservoir is also one 
of Singapore’s 17 reservoirs, and the first in the heart of the city. 
The Barrage brings about resilience in three ways: 

I.  Boosts water supply 

II.  Acts  as  a  flood  control  scheme  to  alleviate  flooding  in  
 

low-lying areas of the city

III.  Raises awareness of the value and importance of water by  
offering a space where the public can get close to water. This  
 
is  supplemented  by 
 
integrating  the  barrage  with  the  
 
surrounding  environment,  including  Gardens  by  the  Bay,  
  Marina Bay and Bay East Garden. Different groups of people  
can  access,  share,  and  utilise  the  space  for  various  
 
 
recreational activities, such as cycling and water sports. 

Integral to the large-scale collection of used water for recycling 
into NEWater is the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS). A 
superhighway for used water management, the DTSS provides a 
cost-effective and sustainable solution to meet Singapore’s long-
term  needs  for  used  water  collection,  treatment,  reclamation, 
and disposal. The DTSS conveys used water entirely by gravity 
to centralised Water Reclamation Plants located at the coastal 
areas.  The  used  water  is  then  treated  and  purified  into  ultra-
clean,  high-grade  reclaimed  water  called  NEWater.  Excess 
treated effluent is discharged to the sea. DTSS Phase 1, covering 
the northern and eastern parts of Singapore, was completed in 
2008. DTSS Phase 2 will extend the deep tunnel system to cover 
the western part of Singapore and is expected to be completed 
by 2025.

A new Tuas NEWater factory will be built as part of the Deep 
Tunnel Sewerage System Phase 2. This will be Singapore’s sixth 
NEWater factory. NEWater and desalinated water are expected 
to meet up to 85% of Singapore’s water needs by 2060.

Research  and  technology  has  allowed  PUB  to  systematically 
close our water loop and this continues to be key in developing 
a more resilient and sustainable water supply in the longer run. 
NEWater  and  desalinated  water,  which  are  weather-resilient 
sources,  are  more  energy-intensive  compared  to  conventional 
water treatment. When reclaiming and recycling used water, PUB 
constantly seeks ways to maximise energy efficiency and lower 
energy use in the whole process. The agency is also exploring 
technologies to halve its energy consumption in desalination.

Managing demand is equally essential to ensuring a sustainable 
water supply. PUB adopts a multi-pronged approach in managing  
water  demand:  pricing  water  to  reflect  its  scarcity  value; 
mandating water efficiency standards; and public education on 
water conservation practices. 

FROM 
RESOURCE 
TO ASSET
“

The Singapore water story is 
one of an integrated urban 
systems approach, in which a 
well-coordinated public-private 
partnership, engaging its various 
stakeholders, has allowed a water 
-stressed city-state to manage its 
ongoing water challenges in an 
integrated and holistic manner.

CASE STUDY

Water—An Asset that Binds Us Together  
In the 1970s and 1980s, concrete, utilitarian drains and canals 
were  rapidly  constructed  alongside  Singapore’s  then  fast-
paced  development  to  alleviate  and  pre-empt  flooding.  The 
completion  of  the  clean-up  of  the  highly  polluted  Singapore 
River and Kallang Basin in 1987 also set in motion a process to 
realise the vision of creating a reservoir in the city. As Singapore 
progressively  increased  its  water  catchment,  there  was  an 
increasing recognition of our water bodies not just as catchment 
areas but as lifestyle and community spaces to be enjoyed. In 
2006,  PUB  launched  the  Active,  Beautiful,  Clean  Waters  (ABC 
Waters)  Programme  to  transform  ugly  functional  drains  and 
canals  into  clean  and  beautiful  streams  and  rivers,  integrated 
with  green  spaces,  for  the  community  to  get  closer  to  water. 
With 17 reservoirs and about 8,000 km of waterways, there is a 
rich opportunity to create spaces to draw people closer to water 
so that they can better cherish our waters and keep our drains 
and canals clean.

Around the same time, PUB set up the 3P (People, Public, Private) 
network. This tri-sector approach brings together stakeholders 
from  the  different  sectors  in  an  aim  to  engage,  educate,  
and  involve  them  so  that  they  will  take  stewardship  of  our  
water resources.

CITY RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK (CRF):

Bringing People Together with Affordable Food
Street hawking was thriving in Singapore during the late 1960s, 
but  many  hawkers  did  not  have  good  hygiene  practices  and 
food-borne  diseases,  such  as  cholera  and  typhoid,  were  very 
common.  In  1970,  we  embarked  on  a  hawker  resettlement 
programme  to  license  and  relocate  18,000  hawkers  from  the 
streets to newly built hawker centres by February 1986.

While hawker centres started as a means of environmental and 
public  health  management,  they  have  developed  and  evolved 
into  a  way  of  life  and  contributed  to  building  resilience  in 
Singapore. On top of offering people affordable and clean food, 
hawker centres have become community spaces where people 
of different races, and cultures mingle. 

To  ensure  that  future  hawker  centres  continue  to  play  these  
vital  roles,  a  Hawker  Centre  3.0  Committee  was  formed  to  
consult  the  different  stakeholders.  In  February  2017,  the 
committee  released  a  report  with  recommendations  covering  
four  key  areas:  sustaining  the  hawker  trade, 
improving 
productivity,  enhancing  hawker  centres  as  social  spaces,  and 
promoting graciousness.

01

Ensuring Food Security
Singapore  was  partially  self-sufficient  in  food  when  it  gained 
independence in 1965. However, as part of an industrialisation 
drive, land for farming was reduced to meet other needs, such 
as housing, industry, roads, and other infrastructure. This led to 
a reliance on food imports as demand increased together with 
Singapore's population growth.

To manage the ever-increasing volume and variety of imported  
food, the Primary Production Department (PPD), which looked  
after  agriculture  in  Singapore,  grew  its  capabilities  in  food 
safety  assurance,  compliance,  and  enforcement.  In  2000, 
PPD  became  the  Agri-food  and  Veterinary  Authority  (AVA)  to 
further develop its mandate of ensuring everyone in Singapore 
has  access  to  safe  and  nutritious  food  at  affordable  prices 
in  the  short  and  long-term.  AVA  reviewed  and  reaffirmed 
its  food  supply  resilience  and  food  safety  strategies  after 
wide  consultations  with  the  industry  and  other  government 
agencies.  The  Singapore  Food  Security  Roadmap  was  
launched  in  2013  to  outline  core  strategies  of  food  source 
diversification and optimising local food production.

sense of place and memory for youths in urbanised Singapore. 
These proposals then travelled around the nearby constituencies 
to gather feedback from the residents.

These residents—including seniors, children, and the physically 
challenged—also got to become 'planners' for a day when they 
were invited to draw up master plans to illustrate how stretches 
of the Rail Corridor near where they lived could be relevant to 
their needs.

The  output  of  these  consultations  were  distilled  into  planning 
and  design  goals  to  guide  the  conceptualisation  and  design 
of  the  Rail  Corridor.  As  part  of  the  request  for  proposal,  “Rail 
Corridor—An  Inspired  and  Extraordinary  Community  Space”, 
a competition was held for design professionals to develop a 
Concept Master Plan and Concept Proposals for the Corridor. 
These proposals, informed by the extensive public consultation, 
produced designs that were better attuned to the needs of the 
communities living along the Rail Corridor. 
Nurturing Communities Through Gardening
Community in Bloom is a programme by NParks to encourage 
and  allow  residents  to  participate  in  community  gardening 
and  urban  farming.  This  nationwide  gardening  movement 
was  launched  in  May  2005  at  Mayfair  Park  Estate  to  foster 
community cohesion and neighbourliness. Today, Community in 
Bloom has created close to 1,000 community gardens across 
Singapore and engaged over 20,000 residents.

Building Our Green Corridor 
After  the  Keretapi  Tanah  Melayu  (KTM)  Berhad  (Malaysian 
Railways Limited) station was relocated from Tanjong Pagar to 
Woodlands on 1 July 2011, the Urban Redevelopment Authority 
(URA) embarked on one of its most extensive public engagement 
exercises to explore ways to develop the disused railway and its 
surrounding land, which became known as the Rail Corridor.

Various 
interest  groups,  residents,  students,  the  general 
public  and  professionals  were  consulted  via  multiple 
means.  To  foster  a  stronger  collaboration  between  public 
interest  groups,  a  working  group 
sector  agencies  and 
(Rail  Corridor  Consultant  Group—RCCG,  which  was 
later 
renamed  the  Rail  Corridor  Partnership)  comprising  officers 
from  the  URA  and  the  National  Parks  Board  (NParks)  as 
well  as  representatives  from  interest  groups  was  created  to  
programme and promote community activities and events along 
the Rail Corridor. 

02

Design workshops and competitions were also held to generate 
interest among students and design professionals. More than 
2,000  secondary  and  polytechnic  students  participated  in 
workshops  to  reimagine  how  the  Rail  Corridor  could  foster  a

CITY RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK (CRF):

Repair  Kopitiam  is  divided  into  four  different  departments: 
electrical  appliances,  fabric  repair,  home  improvement,  and 
responsible  dismantling.  Each  is  led  by  Repair  Coaches—a 
group  of  experts  that  assess  the  condition  of  the  item  and 
guide  participants  to  diagnose  and,  explore  methods  to 
rectify  the  problem  before  repairing  it.  The  aim  is  to  share 
skills  and  knowledge  with  the  participants  instead  of  offering 
a  repair  service  so  that  they  can  pay  it  forward  to  their  
own communities. 

What started as a small meetup session has now doubled in 
size. Repair Kopitiam has helped foster a sense of responsibility 
among  users,  encouraging  them  to  think  about  the  lifecycle 
of  a  product  before  purchasing  it.  This  creates  a  community 
that takes ownership of the environment through small steps, 
such  as  extending  the  shelf  life  of  their  consumer  products 
and  discouraging  a  buy-and-throw-away  culture.  The  meetup 
sessions also build up a social network by bringing people out 
of their houses. 

FROM THE 
GROUND UP

01

Spreading a Culture of Repair
To  combat  the  pervasive  buy-and-throw-away  culture,  social 
enterprise  Sustainable  Living  Lab  (SL2) 
launched  Repair 
Kopitiam in November 2014 to share the skills needed to repair 
everyday items. This ground-up initiative, supported by South-
West  Community  Development  Council  (South-West  CDC) 
and  the  National  Environment  Agency  (NEA),  is  in  line  with 
the  Sustainable  Singapore  Blueprint's  aim  of  creating  a  zero- 
waste nation. 

The  group  meets  on  the  last  Sunday  of  every  month  at 
community centres or public housing void decks to repair once 
broken items brought in by anyone. The group also promotes 
responsible e-waste disposal and fosters community bonding. 
During  the  sessions,  SL2  also  teaches  others  how  to  repair 
things.  The  group  also  promotes  their  movement  on  social 
media and a website (repairkopitiam.sg), encouraging people to 
volunteer at their sessions.

UNITY AMIDST 
DIVERSITY

Ever  since  our  independence,  we  have 
been bringing together different groups of 
people not rooted in a common historical 
experience to establish a nation. This need 
to  build  unity  amidst  diversity  remains 
relevant especially as our population ages 
and becomes increasingly diverse.  

The  examples  that  follow  share  how 
we  have  gone  about  forging  common 
ground and building bridges. The trust and 
networks built will continue to be critical 
for Singapore in the face of new and ever-
evolving challenges ahead.

Resilience  is  achieved  not  only  when  people  invest  personal 
attachments to their public housing flats, neighbourhoods, and 
towns; but also through developing relationships with each other. 
The neighbourliness and social networks built within the public 
housing communities have become the social infrastructure9 for 
a city to survive and adapt to shocks and stresses.

The most innovative policy within the public housing programme 
is the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP). It insists, from the beginning, 
that all estates—right down to each neighbourhood and block—
would house a mix of ethnic groups. This is achieved by instituting 
limits on the number of residents from each race, reflecting the 
ethnic population composition at the national level.
 
Besides integrating the different races, HDB also builds different 
flat types to ensure a mix of different socio-economic groups. 
One  can  find  different  flat  types  (e.g.  2-room,  3-room,  4-room, 
5-room flats) within a public housing block and estate.  There are 
also public and private residences within neighbourhoods.

Design  also  plays  a  part  in  bringing  residents  together.  The  
ground  floor  void  deck,  introduced  in  1970,  offers  an  informal 
space  for  residents  to  meet  and  serves  as  shelter  from  the 
tropical heat for residents passing through it. Another common 
space is the shared corridor on every level. Beyond just a means 
for  residents  to  reach  their  flats,  these  “courtyards  in  the  sky” 
have become communal spaces shared by families living on the 
same floors.

HOUSING 
A NATION
“

My primary preoccupation was to give 
every citizen a stake in the country 
and its future. I wanted a home-owning 
society. I had seen the contrast between 
the blocks of low-cost rental flats, badly 
misused and poorly maintained, and 
those of house-proud owners, and was 
convinced that if every family owned its 
home, the country would be more stable.

“

- Lee Kuan Yew, Founding  
Prime Minister of Singapore8

Providing Affordable and Quality Housing 
Our  vision  to  unite  people  from  different  backgrounds  began 
through developing a society of home owners. This would “give 
every citizen a stake in the country and its future”, as Singapore’s 
founding  Prime  Minister  Lee  proposed.  He  believed  it  was  not 
just desirable but imperative for Singapore’s survival as citizens 
who served as soldiers would see they were defending their own 
home and properties.

Thus, public housing in Singapore is not just about putting a roof 
over people’s heads but provides them with a tangible stake in 
the country. Today, over 80% of the population lives in high-rise, 
high-density  Housing  and  Development  Board  (HDB)  flats  and 
about  90%  of  these  are  owned  by  the  residents.  Every  public 
housing estate also integrates people across social classes and 
ethnicities as they go to the same schools and share common 
public spaces. 

The  vision  of  building  a  home-owning  society  could  not  have 
been possible without good governance and long-term planning. 
By conceptualising and planning whole neighbourhoods, towns, 
and  communities,  Singapore’s  public  housing  programme 
creates a common ground for people of different backgrounds to 
live, work, and play together.

Fostering greater inter-faith understanding between

Bridging communities by creating opportunities and 
spaces for interaction

BRIDGING 
COMMUNITIES 

Working with the Grassroots 
On 1 July 1960, the People’s Association (PA) was formed as a 
grassroots movement to help forge social cohesion and racial 
harmony.  When  PA  first  started,  28  Community  Centres  (CCs) 
were  set  up  as  meeting  grounds  for  various  ethnic,  language, 
and  religious  groups  and  community  leaders  were  appointed 
to  serve  in  the  newly-formed  Community  Centre  Management 
Committees.  Today,  the  role  and  value  of  the  CCs  go  beyond 
just being a community infrastructure. It is a focal point where 
we  build  and  strengthen  social  capital  in  the  community  and 
facilitate active citizenry.  

As  resettlements  to  HDB  flats  expanded,  the  Residents’ 
Committees (RCs) were formed in 1978 to address the needs of 
residents living within a zone rather than the whole estate. Given 
their familiarity with the needs of the residents living in the area, 
RCs  are  an  important  touchpoint  for  residents  to  raise  issues 
and  concerns  to  the  government,  and  promote  neighbourly

interaction, good communal relations among residents staying 
in  the  HDB  estates. Through  organised  activities,  RCs  brought 
residents  together  and  helped  forge  closer  bonds  between 
neighbours.  This  role  was  also  extended  to  Neighbourhood 
Committees (NCs) for private estates in 1998.  

Today,  PA  is  able  to  reach  out  to  a  wide-range  of  participants 
across  its  activities  and  programmes,  which  are  organised 
by  its  1800  Grassroots  Organisations  (GROs)  and  38,000  
Gassroots Leaders. 
Strengthening Inter-Faith Networks of Trust 
The National Steering Committee (NSC) on Racial and Religious 
Harmony  was  formed  in  2006  to  build  close  relationships  
between  the  apex  leaders  of  the  major  ethnic  and  faith 
communities  and  Government.  Together  with  the  Inter-Racial 
and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) at the community level, 
these platforms have allowed community and religious leaders 
to  have  regular  interactions  to  deepen  friendships  and  build 
trust. This has built a foundation for the different ethnic and faith 
groups to co-create opportunities for all Singaporeans to build 
social bonds and trust to enlarge the social commons.

The  work  of  the  IRCCs  has  evolved  over  the  years.  Apart 
from  facilitating  regular  interaction  between  community  and 

religious leaders, it is now also helping to build capacity in the 
community to uphold social cohesion times of a crisis under the  
SGSecure movement.  
Fostering Inter-Faith Understanding
Fostering inter-faith understanding involves forging community 
partnerships  and  encouraging  community-led 
initiatives  to 
deepen racial and religious appreciation. 

In  2017,  BRIDGE  (Broadening  Religious/Racial 
Interaction 
through  Dialogue  and  General  Education)  was  launched  to 
deepen  understanding  of  the  diversity  of  racial  and  religious 
practices 
in  Singapore.  Through  dialogue  and  developed  
content,  participants  build  confidence  in  engaging  respectfully 
through safe spaces, and develop expertise and capabilities to 
lead on sensitive intercultural issues. 

An  example  of  a  BRIDGE  project  organised  with  community 
partners is the Ask Me Anything (AMA) series on different faiths. 
This is a platform that provides a safe space for honest and open 
conversations where participants are encouraged to ask difficult 
and inconvenient questions on matters of faith. While each AMA 
session focuses on a particular faith, it serves as a starting point 
to discuss both topical faith issues and common threads with 
other faiths.
Strengthening Social Cohesion 
in Multicultural Singapore
The National Integration Council (NIC) was set up in April 2009 to 
coordinate and drive social integration efforts through partnership 
of the public, people, and private (3P) sectors. The NIC provides 
strategic direction to four National Integration Working Groups 
(NIWGs) in the areas of community, workplace, education, and 
media. The NIWGs implement programmes that bring together 
Singaporeans, 
immigrants,  and  foreigners  through  shared 
interests, such as sports, arts and volunteerism. In addition, they 
engage  various  partners  in  the  industries  and  media  to  raise 
awareness  of  the  importance  of  integration  and  to  promote 
greater appreciation of cultural diversity. The NIC also facilitates 
efforts by community groups and private sector organisations to 
encourage greater interaction and mutual understanding.

SG Secure
To  counter  the  rise 
in  terrorism  threats,  the  Community 
Engagement  Programme  (CEP)  was  launched  in  2006  to 
strengthen inter-communal bonds and create response plans to 
deal with potential communal tensions after an incident, such as 
a terrorist attack. This is a long-term effort to ensure that we are 
better equipped to maintain our social cohesion and stay united 
in a crisis.
 
Building upon the efforts of the CEP, SG Secure was rolled out 
in 2016 to sensitise, train, and mobilise the community to play 
a  part  in  preventing  and  dealing  with  terrorist  attacks.  Our 
police  and  civil  defence  forces  work  closely  with  grassroots 
volunteers  and  Community  Emergency  Response  Teams  to 
raise residents’ awareness by providing tips on how they should 
respond in a terrorist attack and be better prepared for crises and 
emergencies. There is also an Emergency Preparedness (EP) Day 
where residents learn skills such as first-aid and CPR, as well as 
participate in a scenario drill to familiarise themselves with what 
to do in the event of an attack.

As  part  of  the  SGSecure  Movement,  the  Ministry  of  Culture, 
Community  and  Youth  (MCCY)  established  the  SGSecure 
Community Network (SGCN) to connect community and religious 
organisations so that they are prepared to respond effectively in 
the face of crisis.

Total Defence 
Total defence is a framework for an all-round response to threats 
and  challenges  involving  all  Singaporeans.  It  emphasises  that 
all  Singaporeans  play  a  part,  individually  and  collectively,  in 
building a strong, secure, and cohesive nation—whether it is by 
fulfilling  National  Service  duties;  volunteering  in  Civil  Defence 
activities;  working  hard  and  contributing  to  a  strong  economy;  
strengthening  community  ties  with  one  another  regardless  of 
race and religion; or staying committed to defending the country.

Public  engagements,  consultations  and  outreach  took  place 
across  three  phases  between  2015  and  2017  to  develop  a 
concept  of  the  Memorial  that  would  not  only  honour  the  past, 
but also inspire the future. Over 400 people shared their views 
through 13 dialogue sessions, 1300 individuals were interviewed, 
over 200 responses received via an online portal and more than 
700 participants took part in 15 workshops that were conducted 
across  different  age  and  ethnic  groups.  Key  stakeholder  
groups including architects, planners, and designers; historians 
and the heritage community; educators and academics; public 
servants; pioneer generation; grassroots leaders; union leaders; 
uniformed groups; youths and students; business leaders were 
also engaged.

A CULTURE OF 
ENGAGEMENT

01

Our Singapore Conversation (OSC)
To  better  understand  and  engage  Singaporeans, 
‘Our  
Singapore  Conversation’  was  started  in  2012.  The  national 
conversation  involved  more  than  47,000  residents  in  over  660 
dialogue sessions.

The  Conversation  revolved  around  the  following  questions: 
“What is the Singapore we want to see in the future? What are 
our priorities as a nation? Where do we want to go as a country, 
as a people?

A national survey was also conducted by the Institute of Policy 
Studies (IPS) with 4000 Singaporeans to discuss the Singapore 
that they hope to see in 2030 and their key priorities for today. 
The  survey  also  asked  Singaporeans  about  the  values  they 
feel are important for achieving the 2030 vision as well as their 
preferences on key issues. Job security, healthcare, and housing 
were identified as the top three priorities. 

12 key areas of concern of the population were identified, ranging 
from  the  wellbeing  of  individuals,  communities  and  society, 
to  maintaining  economic  prosperity  and  greater  engagement 
across different sectors. 
SGFuture Engagements 
From  November  2015  to  July  2016,  more  than  8,300  
Singaporeans of diverse ages and from various communities—
including  youths  and  seniors,  persons  with  disabilities,  and 
families—were  involved  in  121  engagement  sessions  as  part 
of  SGFuture.  This  provided  many  Singaporeans  a  springboard 
to participate in national movements, volunteer with non-profit 
organisations for causes close to their hearts or initiate their very 
own ground-up projects to benefit the community.
Founders’ Memorial 
The conceptualisation of the Founders’ Memorial was a chance 
to engage the wider public in the ideation process and to educate 
future generations on the values and principles of the founding 
generation of leaders.

Streets for the People 

Under the Streets for the People initiative by the Urban Redevelopment 
Authority  (URA),  communities  are  provided  with  the  resources  to 
transform  their  streets  into  temporary  public  spaces.  This  contributes 
vibrancy and cohesiveness and supports the overall national objective 
of going car-lite. When communities initiate such a project, streets are 
turned into car-free zones at regular intervals over an extended period of 
time. For instance, the Little India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association 
has  chosen  to  pedestrianise  some  streets  in  Little  India.  Similarly,  the 
Singapore River One business association has also done the same for 
Circular Road, near the Singapore River.

First of five Build-A-Playground pilot projects completed 
Regular Car-Free Sundays 
Regular Car-Free Zones 

Build-A-Playground 
Playgrounds  bring  people  together.  Not  only  do  children  of 
different  backgrounds  come  together  in  these  shared  spaces, 
parents get to meet and make friends there too. This builds up 
the  networks  necessary  for  maintaining  our  social  resilience. 
In  2018,  Singapore  completed  its  first  community-built  play 
space,  Adventure  Playground  @  Canberra. This  was  the  result 
of a Build-A-Playground (BAP) pilot initiative by the Housing and 
Development Board (HDB) to conceptualise, design, and build a 
space in partnership with residents.

This project involved about 1,800 people, from residents living in 
neighbouring blocks of flats to the surrounding community, such 
as  students  from  nearby  schools.  Between  mid-2015  to  2017, 

a  series  of  design  workshops,  roadshows,  and  surveys  were 
conducted with the community to hear their views on what makes 
an enjoyable playground and the kind of playground they would 
like to have. The result is a unique 185 m2 treehouse-and-kelong  
inspired design. 

This  initiative  will  be  extended  to  another  four  HDB  towns, 
namely Toa Payoh, Pasir Ris, Woodlands, and Choa Chu Kang, 
where five new community-built playgrounds will be completed 
in  the  coming  years.  Involving  the  community  in  such  a  small 
but  integral  infrastructure  helps  establish  a  greater  sense  of 
community ownership.

SkillsFuture 
Disruptions  need  not  always  take  the  form  of  shocks.  
The  changing  nature  of  work  and  skills  can  disrupt 
Singapore’s  knowledge-based  economy,  which 
is 
highly  dependent  on  its  people.  In  2015,  SkillsFuture 
was  launched  as  a  national  movement  to  provide 
Singaporeans  with  the  opportunities  to  develop  their 
fullest  potential  throughout 
life  regardless  of  their 
starting points. 

The  aim  is  to  help  individuals  make  well-informed 
choices  in  education,  training,  and  careers.  This  is 
achieved by developing an integrated high-quality system 
of  education  and  training  that  responds  to  constantly 
evolving  needs;  promoting  employer  recognition  and 
career  development  based  on  skills  and  mastery;  and 
fostering a culture that supports and celebrates lifelong 
learning.   

The movement recognises the importance of skills and 
the need to change mindsets around lifelong learning and 
skills mastery. By providing tailored courses and benefits, 
SkillsFuture  plays  a  part  in  Singapore’s  development 
towards an advanced economy and inclusive society.

Singapore  arises  from  an  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on 
Sustainable Development chaired by the Ministry of Environment 
and Water Resource and the Ministry of National Development. 
Launched in 2009, and updated in 2015, the blueprint provides 
all of us an opportunity to work together to create a better home, 
environment, and future for all through the following visions: 

- 
- 
- 

A Liveable and Endearing Home 
A Vibrant and Sustainable City
An Active and Gracious Community

The  SSB  took  in  the  views  of  more  than  130,000  people 
via  consultation  on  land  transport  and  urban  development 
master  plans,  public  dialogues,  and  surveys.  To  demonstrate 
Singapore’s  ambition  in  practising  sustainable  development, 
the plan sets out a variety of targets to be achieved by 2030, 
including:  creating  more  quality  green  and  blue  spaces  for 
the  population;  furthering  mobility  and  connectivity;  fostering 
resource  sustainability;  improving  air  quality  and  drainage 
systems;  and  expanding  community  stewardship  among  
the people.

Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) 

www.gov.sg/microsites/future-economy 

Some 30 representatives from different industries that operate 
in  both  global  and  domestic  markets  as  well  as  from  large 
and small enterprises convened in 2016 to review Singapore’s 
economic strategies and propose ways to further a sustainable 
and inclusive economic growth.

After  engaging  over  9,000  stakeholders,  the  Committee  on 
the  Future  Economy  (CFE)  released  a  report  in  February 
2017  that  identified  seven  mutually  reinforcing  strategies  to 
further Singapore’s economic growth and to build resilience in  
our economy.

The vision for the future economy is for people to develop deep 
skills and be inspired to learn throughout their lives; businesses 
to be innovative and nimble; the city to be vibrant, connected to 
the world, and continually renewing itself; and the government to 
be coordinated, inclusive and responsive. 

Despite  the  challenging  global  environment  we  face  today, 
there  are  many  opportunities  for  Singapore.  The  Committee 
on  the  Future  Economy  report  outlines  how  Singapore  is  in 
a  good  position  to  tap  into  several  growth  sectors,  and  the 
importance  to  continue  to  be  well  connected  externally,  while 
ensuring sufficient space to grow and to rejuvenate internally. 
The  report  also  identified  key  future  actions,  such  as  the 
need  to  build  up  strong  digital  and  cybersecurity  capabilities  
and  implementing  tailored  Industry  Transformation  Maps  for 
each industry.

Action Plan for Successful Ageing 

www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/ifeelyoungsg/about-the-action-
plan/what-is-the-plan-about.html 

This blueprint to prepare Singapore for rapid population ageing in 
the next decade was jointly developed by government agencies, 
voluntary  welfare  and  non-profit  organisations,  academia, 
businesses, as well as community and union leaders. 

Over  4,000  Singaporeans  were  engaged  through  focus  group 
discussions, online consultation and “listening points” at public 
spaces  like  libraries,  shopping  malls,  and  universities.  Union 
members and different ethnic communities were also consulted. 

The plan outlines more than 70 initiatives in 12 areas, including: 
health  and  wellness, 
learning,  volunteerism,  employment, 
housing, transport, public spaces, respect and social inclusion, 
retirement adequacy, healthcare and aged care, protection for 
vulnerable seniors, and research.

GOALS AND 
OPPORTUNITIES

Building  resilience  is  an  ongoing  process. 
Through  engagements  with  stakeholders, 
this  publication  has  identified  some  goals 
and  opportunities—some  underway  and 
some  new—that  can  further  our  resilience 
and bring everyone along this journey. 

interconnected  challenges  of  climate 
The  complex  and 
change  and  changing  demographics  require  more  open  and 
non-conventional  solutions.  Traditional  approaches,  such  as 
rules-based ones, have brought us to where we are today, and 
enabled the necessary changes for our rapid development, but 
they may not necessarily be suitable for today’s and tomorrow’s 
challenges.  During  a  CLC-100RC  workshop  to  identify  key 
resilience challenges and gaps in Singapore, stakeholders from 
different parts of society discussed how new challenges need 
to  be  addressed  with  a  different  approach—one  that  is  less 

straightforward of rules and answers, but nevertheless adheres 
to some of the core values and beliefs that Singapore ascribes 
to as a nation. 

This may mean a more values-based approach to our challenges 
and  opportunities,  one  that  looks  and  frames  the  issue  and 
solutions  with  a  set  of  values  that  residents  and  citizens  of 
Singapore  believe  in  and  can  ascribe  to.  This  could  include 
values such as being caring, confident, inclusive and resilient. 
So  one  would  take  action  and  play  their  part  in  building  up 
Singapore’s resilience because they care about the environment, 
their neighbours and the city. 

A resilient city can be many things. Essentially, it is about how 
a  whole  city  can  come  together,  both  in  the  everyday  and 
during times of crisis. As we anticipate new and ever-evolving 
challenges, we have to face them with the same willingness to 
learn  and  innovate  so  as  to  better  meet  future  problems  that 
come our way. We need continued effort, commitment, and the 
will to take us into the future. We have done it before, and can 
do it again.

FROM AWARENESS 
TO ACTION 

There  is  still  much  room  to  enable  awareness  and  foster 
actions. For example, many Singaporeans may find it difficult to 
understand the urgent need to take action on climate change 
as  we  do  not  experience  major  natural  disasters.  Even  when 
extreme  events  are  felt,  such  as  flash  floods  or  heat  waves, 
many feel climate change as something beyond them or it is the 
“government’s responsibility” to do something about it.  

There is scope for the community, be it individuals or businesses, 
to be better educated and engaged on the risks and challenges  

Singapore’s Climate Action Plan 

https://www.nccs.gov.sg/resources/publications/plans-reports 

As part of the Paris Agreement, Singapore pledged to reduce our 
emissions intensity (emissions per dollar of GDP) by 36% from 
2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise our emissions with the aim of 
peaking around 2030. Singapore’s Climate Action Plan released 
in  2016  outlines  our  strategies  for  climate  change  adaptation 
and mitigation. 

2018: Year of Climate Action

https://www.mewr.gov.sg/climateaction

To encourage greater awareness and action, the Ministry of the 
Environment  and  Water  Resources  (MEWR)    has  designated 
2018 as the “Year of Climate Action”. The tagline, “Take Action 
Today, For A Sustainable Future; Reduce Our Carbon Footprint” 
conveys the key message that tackling climate change cannot 
be the work of the government alone. 
 
Besides  reaching  out  to  the  private  companies  and  public  to 
engage and educate them on how they can contribute, a Climate 
Action Pledge was launched to get individuals and companies 
to publicly declare their readiness to deal with climate change.

arising  from  climate  change  and  be  encouraged  to  be  part 
of  the  action.  We  must  start  a  conversation  across  the 
community about the impacts of climate change, and conduct 
it  in  a  manner  that  is  accessible  and  facilitates  different 
stakeholders' participation in coming up with solutions.

Some  actions  are  underway  or  planned  to  support  the  push 
from awareness to action:

Economy-wide Price Signal to Support 
Singapore's Climate Action Plan

www.nccs.gov.sg/climate-change-and-singapore/reducing-
emissions/carbon-tax 

Singapore’s  carbon  tax  is  an  efficient  method  of  maintaining 
a  transparent  and  consistent  carbon  price  signal  across 
the  economy  to  incentivise  emissions  reduction  where  cost 
is  lowest.  The  Climate  Action  Plan,  launched  in  2016,  sets 
out  four  strategies  to  achieve  a  carbon-efficient  Singapore: 
improving  energy  and  carbon  efficiency  reducing  carbon 
emissions  in  power  generation;  developing  and  deploying 
low-carbon  technology;  and  encouraging  collective  climate 
action. The carbon tax will enhance and support these climate  
change strategies.

Working with Companies for Change

www.fsb-tcfd.org 

Many companies in Singapore currently lack the knowledge and/
or capacity to think about how they will be impacted by climate 
change and how to build resilience within their businesses. 

More  can  be  done  to  facilitate  greater  knowledge  sharing  on 
this topic in the corporate sector. One example is the Task Force 
on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD).  In  2017,  the 
organisation  issued  a  voluntary  framework  for  disclosures  by 
publicly  listed  companies  and  the  financial  sector.  The  Stock 
Exchange  of  Singapore  (SGX)  is  also  encouraging  Singapore 
listed companies to shift towards such a reporting framework. 
This builds upon the mandatory sustainability reporting that was 
recently introduced.

Developing an Integrated Toolkit 
on Resilience Thinking for Cities
Drawing  on  Singapore’s  experience  and  the  100RC’s  network 
and  resources,  CLC  will  be  working  with  100RC  to  research 
and develop an integrated toolkit that seeks to help cities better 
understand  and  apply  key  principles  and  actions  for  building 
resilience, such as applying resilience thinking in planning and 
development.  The  toolkit  will  reference  principles  from  the 
Singapore Liveability Framework and City Resilience Framework, 
and learn from best practices from CLC's and 100RC's networks.

To give emitters time to adjust and implement energy efficiency improvement projects, the initial carbon tax rate has been set at S$5 per tonne of carbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO2e) for a five-year transitional period from 2019. Singapore intends to increase the carbon tax rate to S$10-15/tCO2e by 2030. Singapore will review the tax rate by 2023, taking into account international climate change developments, the progress of our emissions mitigation efforts, and our economic competitiveness.UNIFORM CARBON TAX RATE WITH NO EXEMPTIONSSINGAPORE’S CARBON TAXENHANCE SINGAPORE’S CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGYA carbon tax will enhance and support Singapore’s climate change strategy to reduce emissions across all sectors of the economy by providing a uniform and economy-wide price signal on greenhouse gas emissions.

Colabs 
the  Community 
Foundation of Singapore (CFS) and the National Volunteer and 
Philanthropy  Centre  (NVPC)  that  brings  together  the  public, 
private  and  social  sectors  to  tackle  complex  social  issues.  It 
enables  philanthropists,  businesses,  and  non-profits  sector 
experts with a common focus to build insights and co-create  
solutions together. 

The  collaborative  process  typically  comprises  three  stages. 
First,  stakeholders  go  on  a  learning  journey  to  gain  in-depth 
knowledge of social causes. With new insights, members with 
similar  interests  identify  opportunities  to  work  together  on  a 
problem and get behind a common agenda. Lastly, they share 
resources  and  expertise,  working  together  to  achieve  their 
shared vision for social change.

In 2017, Colabs focused on children and youth. In 2018, Colabs 
will  examine  issues  around  two  other  communities—persons 
with disabilities, and seniors.

Our Singapore Fund (OSF)

www.sg/oursingaporefund 

Our  Singapore  Fund  (OSF)  supports  meaningful  projects  by 
passionate Singaporeans—projects that build national identity or 
meet social and community needs. This umbrella fund is made 
up of supporting funds from the Ministry of Culture, Community 
and  Youth  (MCCY),  Tote  Board  (Singapore  Totalisator  Board), 
and the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise (raiSE).

Some examples of OSF projects:

Community Living Room at Block 52 
This  project  brings  together  residents  and  stakeholders  from 
Block  52  Cassia  Crescent,  in  the  planning  and  design  of  a 
community space at the level 2 void deck. 

The team from Participate in Design (P!D) has been engaging 
the  block's  residents  through  a  series  of  intensive  house-to-
house  interviews  conducted  with  some  50  households  to 
understand  the  needs  and  opportunities  of  the  community.  
Pop-up community design workshops were then held to suss 
out ideas on how residents envision the void deck space. Based 
on their collective insights, aspirations, and ideas, the void deck 
at level 2 was eventually chosen as the site of intervention for the 
team to design and activate in collaboration with the community.
 
By applying a participatory design process with a community-
driven  approach,  P!D  hopes  to  renew  a  sense  of  belief  that 
everyone  has  something  positive  to  contribute  towards  the 
design  and  planning  of  an  inclusive  community  space  that 
residents can proudly call their own.

More than Just 
With a firm belief that proper civic discourse on race and racism 
is important in multiracial Singapore, Lewis Liu and Chen Li Yi, 
started this series of closed-door conversations.
 
Over three dinner conversations, they created safe spaces for 
people  from  diverse  backgrounds  to  explore  their  differences 
together.  Putting  his  experience  as  a  facilitator  to  good  use, 
Lewis  guided  participants  through  touchy  and  uncomfortable 
topics such as race and racism in Singapore.
 
Through  these  discussions,  participants  were  invited  to  share 
their  views  and  personal  stories  in  a  safe  and  constructive 
environment. Participants were able to see beyond labels and 
build trust with people from other ethnicities, with some even 
continuing their conversations long after the event had ended.

Creating Friendly and Lively Estates 

www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/community/hdb-community-week/hdb-

To enliven our common spaces and forge community spirit in 
our estates, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) came 
up  with  the  Friendly  Faces,  Lively  Places  Fund  in  2016.  The 
fund  supports  residents'  ground  up  activities  and  has  been 
well-received, with some 50 projects island-wide. Some of the 
projects involve physical works like converting a grass patch to 
a play and gardening yard, while others include handicraft and 
gardening workshops. 

All  of  these  initiatives  are  created  by  the  community,  for  the 
community. The funding cap for the programme has since been 
increased from $10,000 to $20,000 so that residents can plan 
larger-scale and more impactful community projects. The fund 
has also been extended to the Merchants’ Associations within 
the HDB heartlands, so they too, can make use of this resource 
to enliven HDB spaces near their businesses.

as  the  National  Youth  Forum  and  YouthSPEAK,  the  Youth 
Conversations was launched in April 2018 to provide a sustained 
platform for the government to engage youth, and gather their 
views, concerns and aspirations.  

The  Youth  Conversations  aims  to  strengthen  our  social  
compact with youths, and build strong national identity by giving 
them a stake in the country. Youth will be able to meet peers 
with diverse perspectives, have a say in key policy issues that 
affect them, as well as co-create and co-deliver solutions with 
the government.

Looking Out for Our Seniors 
As Singapore ages rapidly in the coming years, we need to build 
a strong community-based support system to help our seniors 
stay healthy for as long as possible, and provide seniors with 
needs with the necessary help quickly.
 
The  Community  Networks  for  Seniors  (CNS)  brings  together 
different  stakeholders  on  the  ground  to  promote  the  ABCs  of 
ageing well: 

for  seniors 

and engaged

(i)  Active  Ageing 
 
(ii)  Befriending  seniors  who 
 
(iii)  Care coordination for seniors with health and social needs 

live  alone  or  at-risk  of  

to  keep  active,  healthy  

social isolation

The key idea in CNS is to draw on the energies of community 
partners to jointly engage and support our seniors for maximum 
impact,  rather  than  to  centralise  or  replace  their  efforts.  CNS 
partners  include  voluntary  welfare  organisations,  grassroots 
organisations, 
regional  health  systems  and  government 
agencies  such  as  the  Health  Promotion  Board  and  Social 
Service Offices. 

CNS  has  shown  the  potential  of  synergising  the  efforts  of 
different stakeholders to engage more seniors to build a more 
proactive community care system for seniors. Between January 
to April 2018 alone, 55,000 seniors have been engaged on CNS 
outreach. Over 7,000 seniors have attended functional screening 
comprising  basic  eye,  oral  and  vision  checks  at  community 
nodes  in  the  heartlands  such  as  senior  activity  centres, 
Residents’ Committee centres and Community Clubs.

Furthering the Resilience Agenda Together 
Drawing  on  participatory  design  approaches  from  best  
practices, such as Rebuild by Design in New York City and the 
Rail  Corridor  in  Singapore,  CLC  will  be  working  with  relevant 
stakeholders  to  bring  together  communities,  government 
officials,  and  experts  from  different  disciplines  to  better 
understand  the  challenges  brought  about  by  climate  change 
and empower communities to be more involved in coming up 
with solutions for challenges and issues such as flash floods. 
This  will  not  only  help  raise  awareness  about  the  resilience  
challenge, but go a step further to work with the community, for 
the community, in building up our resilience.

LEARNING FROM 
THE 100RC NETWORK 

As part of the 100RC Network, Singapore is inspired by the initiatives and efforts of member cities in building resilience. We look 
forward to learning from each other and strengthening our partnerships through the sharing of best practices and collaborations. 
Here are a few examples from various cities:

RESILIENT VEJLE

1

San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland  are  piloting  the  Bay  Area  Resilient by  Design  Challenge,  a 
public-private partnership that seeks to pool the talents of the best minds in the region—experts in ecology, 
technology, design and social activism—to translate advances in research into specific, place-based solutions 
to  flood  risk  and  sea  level  rise.  These  innovative  ideas  address  long-term  threats,  in  addition  to  current 
challenges, including the essential infrastructure needs of communities on the frontline of sea level rise. More 
about the Challenge, including the final team presentations, can be found at http://www.resilientbayarea.org/.

Vejle  is  promoting  collaboration  between  citizens  and 
companies  on  the  topic  of  flooding,  encouraging  citizens 
living in higher altitude areas of the valley, fjord and harbor to 
take action on storm water management on their own land.

Rotterdam 
is  embedding 
climate adaptation into the urban 
fabric  of  the  city  through  Water 
Sensitive  Rotterdam 
(WSR). 
This  action  encompasses  both 
a large number of small citizen- 
and business-led projects, as well as larger-scale 
efforts  to  deepen  understanding  and  support 
research  around  climate  action.  The  end  goal 
is  to  promote  a  new  way  of  thinking,  in  which 
rain water is seen not as a threat but a valuable 
raw  material  that  should  be  locally  utilised. The 
city's Zoho district is an example where climate 
adaptation  projects 
the  multifunctional 
Benthemplein  water  square  have  acted  as  a 
catalyst for sustainable development and greater 
social cohesion.

Los Angeles  is increasing

building 
social  cohesion  by  connecting 
community  organisations  with 
experts and resources to guide 
and  efficiently  support 
the 
development of neighbourhood resilience hubs. 
Hubs  will  be  fortified  with  the  most  up-to-date 
electricity,  water,  communications,  and  seismic 
technologies  to  ensure  that  critical  services 
are  maintained  during  and  after  a  disaster.  On 
an  everyday  basis,  Hubs  will  also  foster  social 
cohesion  while  addressing  chronic  community 
stressors  through  outreach,  education,  and 
connections to existing social and environmental 
stewardship programs and services.

Medellin 
has committed to 
integrating 
and 
coordinating 
the 
city’s 
information 
in  a  single  system 
so that public and private entities 
and  communities  can  obtain  up-
to-date  information.  To  achieve 
its goal  of  an  equitable Medellin, 
one of the flagship initiatives is to 
set up A Colaboratorio, a citizens’ 
meeting place to share knowledge 
and learn, especially for the youth.

New York is 
working to ensure that 
its  neighbourhoods 
and  public  services 
are ready to withstand 
and  emerge  stronger 
from  the  impacts  of  climate  change 
by  strengthening  community-based 
organisations.  The  city  will  develop 
a  comprehensive, 
interactive  web-
based platform to map both small and 
large  community  organisations  and 
activities, as well as local government 
services and initiatives, across the city. 
This  will  encourage  more  effective 
coordination, 
and 
decision-making in these efforts. The 
city will also enhance volunteerism by 
enhancing  the  NYC  Service  platform, 
which  connects  programs  in  need 
of  support  with  available  volunteers, 
including in emergency response and 
recovery efforts.

The  city  will  link  this  new  institution  to  campaigns  on 
resilience  issues,  which  will  bring  community-level  events 
like  street  plays  and  mock  emergency  drills  to  the  city’s 
neighborhoods.  Citizens  will  also  be  encouraged  to  engage 
further in the city’s development process via public debates

Melbourne 
is  kick-
starting  the  Neighbourhood 
Project, which will provide 12 
months of capacity building, 
resources  and  mentoring  to 
participating  communities 
on  how  to  turn  under-used  land  into  green 
spaces. This will include training in design and 
project  management.  The  Neighbourhood 
Project will also tackle barriers that impede 
community-led  place-making  projects,  such 
as  planning  scheme  requirements.  It  will 
work with councils to better understand and 
remove  these  barriers,  while  still  ensuring 
that councils can fulfil their legal and public 
safety obligations. The action will transform 
24  under-used  spaces  in  8  neighbourhoods 
into useful community public spaces, using a 
‘tactical urbanism’ methodology.

 on new endeavours and initiatives, and reach out for new opportunities, one that may have never been imagined before”. Refer to Rodin (2014).

A RESILIENT  SINGAPORE

How  can  cities  be  better  prepared  in  the  face  of  impending 
stresses and shocks? What are the innovative solutions that 
cities can adopt to address cross-cutting challenges such as 
climate change and changing demographics? In a world where 
cities are facing increasingly complex challenges, resilience is 
critical for cities to not just survive, but adapt and thrive.

A  Resilient  Singapore  maps  out  what  Singapore  has  done 
and  will  continue  to  do  to  build  its  resilience.  Through  the 
sharing of case studies and actions, this publication captures 
Singapore’s  resilience  story—An  urban  transformation  into  a 
highly  liveable,  sustainable  yet  high-dense  city-state  and  its 
continued  pursuit  to  maintain  a  competitive  economy  while 
ensuring a high quality of life for its residents.   

Resilience requires us to take an integrated systems approach. 
It  is  as  much  about  robust  infrastructure  and  plans  as  it  is 
about involving and engaging diverse stakeholders. Everyone 
has a part to play in this ongoing journey of building a resilient 
Singapore,  to  make  the  city  better  in  times  of  peace  and  to 
work together to weather any crisis.
