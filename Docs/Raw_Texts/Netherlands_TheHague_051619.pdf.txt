THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYTHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYLetter from Pauline Krikke, 
Mayor of The Hague

Letter from Michael Berkowitz, 
President of 100 Resilient Cities

Dear Hagenaars,

The Hague is a beautiful, green city by the sea. No wonder our city is an increasingly popular place to live and 
work, especially among young people – the number of inhabitants is expected to rise to about 600,000 in 2030. 
This growth comes with big challenges that are both physical and social.

Therefore we are very excited to be part of the 100 Resilient Cities network - pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation. As part of an international network we have noticed that other cities face the same issues as The 
Hague. Through this network and the exchange of knowledge we do not only work to strengthen our own city, 
but also to make the world more resilient.  

This Resilience Strategy lays out initiatives that contribute to the resilience of our city. The coming years we will 
apply this strategy to the city, although this does not mean that our city will be finished after. Like the sea, The 
Hague is in constant motion. The Hague faces changes that require a new way of thinking. We must dare to take 
alternative paths and dare to experiment. And we need everyone in The Hague to get involved in this journey.

Urban resilience is part of The Hague’s DNA. As a coastal city, we are aware of the challenges that our 
environment gives us. The sea forms a natural border to our city, so in order to house a growing population we 
must invest heavily into the already built environment. At the same time, this should not be at the cost of our 
green areas as they are such an important element for the liveability of our city. By thinking outside the normal 
set of standards and increase collaboration, we will be able to make these developments go together. A green and 
climate ready city that welcomes everyone. 

But a resilient The Hague has more than just a physically strong environment. Digital innovation also has its effects 
on our city. New technologies are able to make life in the city a lot more enjoyable, but for this reason it is also 
important to understand the risks that come with it. To ensure that digitisation will positively contribute to the 
liveability of our city now and in the future, we will continue to work on our cyber security. 

But most importantly, The Hague is about the people that live here. A city can only truly flourish if it is socially 
strong and balanced. To achieve this, it is essential that people connect with each other. It is my sincere wish for 
people in our city to get to know each other better. Meet your next-door neighbour and the people from the next 
block.  Because if we meet each other more, we will be able to increase resilience for the whole of The Hague.  

By doing so, we will build a better city to live in. A strong and resilient city!

Pauline Krikke
Mayor of The Hague

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, it is my great pleasure to congratulate the City of The Hague, 
Mayor Pauline Krikke, and Chief Resilience Officer Anne-Marie Hitipeuw on the release of The Hague’s first urban 
Resilience Strategy – an exciting milestone for the city and our partnership. Through this Strategy, The Hague 
builds on its past to lay the foundations for a more resilient future. 

A coastal city boasting natural beauty, The Hague is also a place of cultural richness and diversity, a hub for more 
than 300 international companies and organisations, and a locus of expertise in justice and human rights. As the 
city sets forth on implementing the actions in this Strategy to build resilience in the 21st Century, it will leverage 
these origins and assets. And it will do so while simultaneously recognising that addressing the city’s rapid 
growth, the effects of climate change, and threats to social cohesion require both working in a different way and 
collaborating with a broad range of partners.

Like many previous Strategies in the 100RC Network, The Hague’s Resilience Strategy truly stands out for 
the way it puts people at the heart of its approach: from working to connect individuals to become more risk 
prepared; to making neighbourhoods more peaceful; to advancing city-wide policies on procurement; and forging 
partnerships regionally to understand interdependencies between critical infrastructure. It is a strong testament 
to Resilient The Hague’s vision that it takes an entire city – not just government alone – to build resilience, 
without losing sight of the city’s people and communities.

With this Strategy, The Hague offers much for cities around the world to learn from, such as the pioneering 
work The Hague is undertaking to address cyber risks. Furthermore, the city does not perceive digitisation as 
a challenge, but rather as a unique opportunity to critically re-think social inequalities and the development of 
future skills. I encourage every reader to take a closer look at these tangible initiatives and tap into the wealth of 
expertise The Hague has to offer.

Uncertainty is now perhaps the only characteristic of our time and unforeseen risks and opportunities will 
inevitably emerge in the years ahead. But with the strong foundation and agile approach laid out in these pages, 
we are confident that The Hague’s Resilience Strategy will realise its ambitions and concrete actions to positively 
impact the lives of all who call the city home. Now, the work of collectively achieving the goals outlined in the 
coming pages begins, and we are thrilled to be a partner in the work ahead to continue building a more resilient 
and just The Hague.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYTHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYTHE HAGUE 
RESILIENCE STRATEGY

Letter from Anne-Marie Hitipeuw,  
The Hague’s Chief Resilience Officer

In the past year we worked hard on this Resilience Strategy. We certainly did not do that alone. Together with 
people inside and outside city hall, we developed the content of this strategy. People who already put so much 
effort into future proofing our beautiful city. Many good things are already happening and it is inspiring to see how 
the municipality, residents, companies and knowledge institutions work together for our city.

Following the guidance given to us by our Advisory Committee (p.109), the Resilient The Hague team wanted 
to focus on those initiatives that can really make a difference. The message was simple: select initiatives where 
the Resilient The Hague programme is decisive for its realisation. By focusing on these activities, The Hague will 
become an even stronger and more resilient city that can cope with the shocks and stresses of the future. 

It all starts with resilient people who live comfortably and safely in liveable neighbourhoods. Together these 
neighbourhoods form a strong and just city. And because many of the challenges we face – such as the effects 
of climate change, the new digital economy, and promoting social resilience – do not stop at the borders of our 
municipality, we work together with our regional partners.

Thanks to 100RC and its network, in the past two years we have also learned a great deal from cities outside the 
Netherlands. We for example hosted a side event at the One Conference of the National Cyber Security Center on 
Cyber Resilient Cities with Atlanta and Manchester. This gave us many valuable insights to prevent and mitigate a 
cyber incident. As we move into implementation, we will continue to draw on these experiences from other cities, 
along input from specialists, companies and knowledge institutions that offer support to the 100RC network.

Developing this strategy was only possible with the help of all those people who have been thinking along with us 
about how to strengthen the resilience of our city. We want to thank everyone who has cooperated. I am proud 
of this strategy and I am confident that the new and existing initiatives described in the strategy, really make a 
difference in The Hague. Together we are building a strong and resilient city.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYTHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYWhy urban resilience? 

Benefits of the 100RC Network

In 2016, The Hague was chosen from over 1,000 
applications to join the 100RC Network. Being 
part of this benefits our city in four  
different ways:

 ̆ Receiving funding for a Chief Resilience 
Officer to coordinate resilience-building 
efforts 

 ̆ Obtaining access to expert support from 

leading global providers of resilience 
services and expertise.

 ̆ The City Resilience Framework (developed 

by Arup) is used by all partners in the  
100RC network and facilitates the 
cooperation between cities. 

 ̆ It offered guidance developing the 

strategy.

Multiple benefits of 
our initiatives

Page 105 shows how 
how the initiatives in 
this strategy will create 
benefits across the four 
dimensions of the CRF.

Today, 55% of the world population is living in 
urban areas, a percentage which is projected to 
be 68% in 2050. Not only are cities growing, they 
are also becoming increasingly interdependent. 
The effects of events in one place can be felt 
around the world. This rapid urbanisation has 
many benefits for efficiency, as well-functioning 
cities can provide employment and other 
opportunities for large numbers of people. 
However, as more human and economic resources 
concentrate in cities, the potential consequences 
of unexpected events become even greater, and 
when managed poorly, the urban environment 
and quality of life can suffer. 

The Hague is no exception to this. Despite the 
strength and durability our city has demonstrated 
in response to crises over many centuries, the 
interconnected and rapidly evolving world also 
presents The Hague new challenges and enlarged 
threats. 

This Resilience Strategy helps The Hague to 
strengthen the capacities of its residents, 
communities, institutions, businesses and systems 
to better withstand these future shocks and 
stresses. A resilient city is not only prepared to 
survive the shocks and stresses that might occur 
over time, but is also able to respond in a way 
that makes the city grow and thrive afterwards. 
By investing in resilience now, rather than waiting 
until disaster strikes, cities stand to benefit from 
the investment in good times as well as bad. For 
example, improving our green spaces reduces 
our vulnerability to the shock of heatwaves and 
heavy downpours but it also helps purify our air 
and provides improved amenity all year round. 
In the 100RC network this is called a ‘resilience 
dividend’.

100 RESILIENT CITIES (100RC)
100RC - pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, was formed 
to help cities around the world helps cities around the world 
prepare to meet the physical, social and economic challenges 
that are a growing part of the 21st century. 100RC defines 
urban resilience as:

“the capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within 
a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter 
what kinds of chronic stresses and acute 
shocks they experience.”

The Hague regards participation in the 100RC Network as a two-way street. 
It enables us to share our own knowledge and experiences with other cities 
to solve problems collectively, and learn from each other. The Hague will not 
only become a more resilient city, but also help to create a global practice 
of urban resilience and illustrate the demand for resilience solutions to the 
market.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYTHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYDeveloping the strategy 

After joining the 100RC Network in May 2016, the 
Resilient The Hague team held an Agenda Setting 
Workshop in December 2016. The aim was to 
introduce the concept of resilience – not an easy 
word to translate into the Dutch language – and 
agree with the City on a way forward to develop 
this Strategy. This was followed by Phase 1 of the 
Strategy, during which a baseline understanding of 
The Hague’s resilience challenges was developed, 
which led to release of The Hague’s first Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment (PRA) in January 2018. 
The PRA identified  four discovery areas and three 
cross-cutting themes to guide the future efforts of 
the Resilient The Hague (RTH) team and the city as a 
whole, while being aware of the existing programmes 
like on energy transition and on the circular economy 
that already make an effort in The Hague.  The 
Resilience Strategy wants to build on existing efforts, 
instead of duplicating them.

From the PRA could also be derived that a Resilience Strategy for The Hague 
should support new type of collaborations between different stakeholders. 
Building further upon this, RTH sent out a wide call to include citizens, businesses, 
and institutions in the process of developing the Strategy.

Together with these partners and other parties involved with The Hague, the 
RTH team entered Phase 2 during which they went deeper into an attempt to 
understand root causes of our resilience challenges and unlock new opportunities. 
The RTH team organised working groups with experts and meetings with citizens, 
conducted interviews, visited projects, and listened to the perspectives of many 
people inside and outside City Hall. 

With the input of stakeholders spanning the CRF, this led to selection of the 41 
initiatives that comprise this Strategy. Core to all initiatives is the aim to achieve 
multiple goals from a single investment and promote integration across traditional 
silos. The initiatives are organised under four scales (see page 37), which reflect 
the different levels at which The Hague must act to improve the resilience of all 
citizens: as individuals, within neighbourhoods, across our city, and spanning our 
entire region.

The Strategy is not a final and holistic document that depicts comprehensive 
solutions to all challenges, shocks and stresses that our citizens encounter. It is 
a waypoint on an ongoing resilience journey for The Hague and will be regularly 
updated to reflect new challenges and opportunities.

During Phase 2 the team and their partners were 
on a constant lookout for initiatives and ideas. 
This brought the understanding of just how many 
inspiring collaborations are already underway in our 
city, each contributing to our resilience in its own 
way. It became clear that while this Strategy must 
propose new ways forward, it must equally be about 
celebrating and scaling what already exists. During 
Phase 2 160 potential initiatives were identified, 
ranging from small scale actions that target individual 
citizens, to large scale projects drawing on regional 
and international collaboration. A range of analytical 
tools and measurements– including 100RC’s City 
Resilience Framework (CRF) and the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 
– were applied  to systematically test, refine and 
prioritise these opportunities. The SDGs will also be 
used for monitoring of the Strategy implementation 
(see page 107).

Although not always labelled this way, people have been working hard to maintain The Hague’s resilience for centuries. Through 
developing this strategy we learnt about so many existing plans, programmes and projects that help us withstand shocks, tackle 
stresses and improve quality of life for our citizens. 

This Strategy can provide a helpful framework for drawing important linkages between the many programs already underway in 
our city, resulting in greater benefits that come from a systems approach.

for The Hague

Shocks

Acute shocks are sudden, sharp events that can immediately disrupt a city. In The 
Hague, key known and emerging shocks include:  

View on The Hague, Jan van Goyen, The Hague Historical Museum

Just like artists from “The Hague School” sought 
to illustrate in their paintings, The Hague is a city 
of contrasts. Stroll through our city and you’ll 
witness world-renowned historical sites alongside 
modern architecture. You will sense a dynamic 
business environment but may also get some sand 
in your shoes on one of our relaxing beaches.  You 
will meet people that have lived in The Hague for 
generations as well as connect to more recent 
arrivals from 180 different nationalities. We are 
proud of this The Hague. 

As a city of contrasts, we are also a city of 
ambitions. The Coalition Agreement 2018-2022 
shows the Mayor and Aldermen’s plans for this 
period. It mentions challenging goals on growth, 
mobility, sustainablity, security and inclusiveness. 
Expanding the timeframe to 2030, the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
mention the grand ambitions to end poverty, 
protect the planet and ensure prosperity for 
all. We aim for these goals with confidence. 
We have learned considerably from the global 
economic crisis and today we enjoy scientific and 
technological resources that are greater than ever.

However, we must also recognise that we live in a world of risks. One of the first 
steps to build resilience is to understand what these possible adversities may be. 

The Hague is home to major international organisations such as The 
International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, Eurojust, 
Europol and the OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons). Additionally, our city is a convenient base for over 300 
international organisations and NGOs contributing 38,500 jobs to The 
Hague’s economy. The Hague also hosts multinationals such as Shell, 
Siemens and Aegon. 

The National Government is mainly based in The Hague, along with 
institutes such as the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), 
Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB), Environmental 
Assessment Agency (PBL), National Coordinator Terrorism and Security 
(NCTV) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). 

As we are the host of all these organisations and businesses,  a crisis can 
have an impact on a local, national, and even international scale. 

Taking a resilience approach means understanding our risks – and the complex 
relationships between them.

Cyber attacks
Our daily life takes place increasingly 
online. Companies, institutions 
and our critical infrastructure 
increasingly depend on digital 
technology. Therefore cyber attacks 
pose an increasing risk to the 
functioning of cities. That especially 
applies to The Hague because 
our city houses the National 
Government, international courts 
and international companies. ICT 
failure then not only affects our 
own inhabitants and companies, 
but can also have national and even 
international consequences.

The National Cyber Security Center lists six key challenges for cyber resilience:  

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
 

Cyber attacks are often profitable, easily executed and low-risk for an actor. 
Attack software and resources are easily accessible.
Unsafe products and services are being used.
Considerations on costs and user friendliness lead to concessions to cyber resilience. 
Increasing complexity and connectivity complicate organising cyber resilience.
Dutch organisations depend heavily on a limited number of foreign suppliers of cyber security  
products and services.

Extreme rainfall or periods of prolonged heat and drought will become increasingly common in our 
city. The impact of extreme weather can be amplified by our ageing population, who can be more 
vulnerable to these events. The heat stress and climate score maps show how the impact of extreme 
weather can vary for each neighbourhood.

Heat waves 
Extreme heat is a growing problem that reduces labour productivity 
and can disproportionately affect the health of vulnerable people 
(e.g. elderly and sick). In The Hague, the ‘urban heat island effect’ 
(where large, built-up areas increase temperatures relative to 
surrounding places) is the strongest in the city centre (including the 
Schilderswijk and Transvaal), Scheveningen and Laak (including the 
Binckhorst).

Flooding

Our region is within dike ring 14 and largely below sea level. Besides flooding from the sea 
and rivers, flooding can also occur after heavy rainfall.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUETHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUEPandemics
Like other large cities The Hague has a high population density, which can 
increase the spread of communicable diseases. An outbreak of pandemic flu is 
a priority risk on both national and regional levels.

Extremist acts
As the administrative centre of the Netherlands and with the presence of 
many national and international organisations, according to the NCTV, risks 
related to terrorism are substantial for our city.

Civil unrest
Being an important political and judicial centre, 
The Hague is often the stage of major events, 
conferences and demonstrations. Some of those 
events come with an increased risk of disruption 
of public order. In addition, other national and 
international issues can lead to tensions in society.  

Disruption of critical 
services 
Being either a shock by itself, or a possible
consequence of other shocks, a disruption 
of critical services can directly impact a large 
number of people, institutions and companies. 
Although Dutch critical infrastructure is generally 
robust, examples like the 2015 power outage in 
the Province of North Holland prove that large 
disruptions do happen. Dependencies between 
different critical services is a key area for future 
attention. 

22

Stresses

Chronic stresses are slowly moving phenomena that weaken the fabric of a 
city. Stresses can themselves lead to a major shock –  for example, Cape Town 
in South Africa recently came close to running out of water. This occurred due 
to the chronic issues such as lower rainfall, population growth and inadequate 
forward planning.

A city’s stresses can also act as ‘shock amplifiers’ 
that significantly worsen the consequences of a 
major distruptive event and reduce the capacity 
to respond. For example, cities with an ageing or 
unhealthy population may have higher mortality 
rates during a major heatwave.

Climate change
Climate change is a true shock amplifier, increasing 
the likelihood and consequence of risks such as 
extreme weather, drought and outbreaks of some 
diseases. With 700 million people worldwide living 
in coastal areas, climate-induced sea level rise 
and extreme events are also expected to increase 
the global flow of refugees. This brings the 
consequences of global climate change to cities 
with well developed protective infrastructure, like 
The Hague.

Poverty and debt
In 2018, 62,856 households in our city had an income of no more than 130% 
of the legal social minimum. With tight financial means it is more difficult to 
overcome setbacks. In addition, financial concerns can hold people from taking 
resilience-enhancing measures such as a buying a smoke detector or making an 
emergency kit. Having limited financial resources and/or problematic debt can be 
a huge source of stress, potentially leading to adverse physical health impacts, 
domestic issues and difficulties holding employment.

A lack of financial resources limits people’s ability to overcome additional shocks 
and stresses. People in debt are likely to isolate themselves from society, leading 
to social segregation and making it even harder to get out of debt.

In some areas our city is one of sharp dividing 
lines showing the spatial segregation of different 
communities and social classes. Segregation is 
not just about money and assets, it is also about 
liveability, cultural diversity, and equality of 
opportunities. Segregation potentially limits the 
social cohesion in our city and is associated with 
polarisation.

While liveability in many neighbourhoods is 
improving, the Liveability index (right) also highlights 
areas, like The Hague Southwest, that need 
investment and innovative thinking to better realise 
their potential.

The liveability index (Leefbaarometer) aggregates 
more than 100 indicators on housing, security, 
residents, facilities and the physical environment of 
neighbourhoods.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUETHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUELimitations of transport 
network
Some neighbourhoods in The Hague have 
relatively limited access to public transport, which 
constraints the mobility in parts of our city. Also 
the capacity of the public transport and the road-
system are increasingly under pressure as the 
number of citizens, visitors and jobs grow. This 
can even problematic in case of an evacuation, 
considering that the coastal position of The Hague 
limits the number of evacuation possibilities. 

Unemployment
A job offers a social network and income. Both are 
important resources for resilience.

We must ensure that residents with the capacity 
to work are employed. This may require innovative 
methods, particularly for residents with a distance 
to the labour market.

Subversive crime
Subversive crime such as money laundering and 
other forms of fraud weaken the very foundations 
of our society. Criminal money flowing into the 
regular economy is extremely undesirable and can 
have major consequences for the business climate, 
liveability, social cohesion and security.

Uneven health outcomes
Despite good accessibility of medical care in the 
Netherlands, we see substantial health differences. 
There is up to a 9 year difference in life expectancy 
between some of our neighbourhoods, and 
looking at the number of years that people live in 
good health this gap grows to 16 years.1 Experts 
attribute this difference not only to lifestyle, but 
also to stress. Health differences can lead to some 
groups being hit extra hard when a catastrophe 
occurs.

Digitisation
Digitisation and new technologies will bring many 
opportunities for those with the right skills to 
adapt to new ways of working. But it also has the 
potential to further deepen dividing lines between 
those who have the skills and money to keep up 
with the digitisation and those who have not. As 
jobs become obsolete or sectors disappear, some 
people might also be left behind. That is certainly 
relevant for The Hague. Our city has a relatively 
one-sided economy that relies heavily on the 
public sector. Compared to other major cities in the 
Netherlands and Europe, the technology sector in 
The Hague is small.
 
Population growth 
The Hague is expected to grow by about 5,000 
residents each year until 2030 . While this comes 
with great opportunities for investment it also puts 
pressure on the housing market and challenges our 
city to densify.

With foreign immigration making up about half of 
this growth we will need to use effective ways to 
integrate newcomers into our society. Teaching 
language skills is one of the critical ingredients to 
successful integration. The Hague’s population is 
also ageing, with solid growth in the number of 
65 to 80 year-olds. Loneliness is a priority risk for 
this group. Maintaining quality of life and keeping 
this group self-reliant and connected will require 
innovative solutions.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUETHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUEFive key opportunities to 
build resilience

So far we have heard about a range of challenges confronting The Hague’s resilience. 
This section describes five cross-cutting opportunities to address these challenges.

Our five resilience opportunities should not be viewed in isolation and are often interconnected. We embrace this complexity 
as it gives the possibility for one initiative to link to multiple resilience opportunities and have multiple benefits.

1.Ensuring a connected and inclusive society

To make our city resilient we must adress a number 
of current and emerging social challenges. Our 
diagnostic work strongly indicated that we must 
recognise that some of our residents struggle to 
meet basic needs and have limited capacity or 
resources to handle acute shocks or cope with 
chronic stresses. 

Building a connected and inclusive society requires a holistic approach. ‘Brick 
and mortar’ policies on the development of housing, mobility, and public 
space are just as important as social policies on youth, the elderly, wellbeing 
and education. We need to promote equality of opportunity for all children 
and make sure that all our citizens – especially our most vulnerable – can 
locate the many sources of support our city has to offer. We also need to 
facilitate professionals and voluneers who want to contribute collectively to 
an inclusive society.

An example of such an holistic approach is the development of the Central 
Innovation District: an area between and around the train stations The 
Hague Central, Hollands Spoor and Laan van NOI. While innovation districts 
can develop into exclusive areas for the highly educated, the goal is to 
develop an inclusive district where all people can work, live and recreate. 

The Southwest area of The Hague also strongly calls for an holistic approach. 
There is a great opportunity to use proposed housing and public transport 
redevelopments to create multiple benefits that also address social 
challenges related to employment, inclusiveness and social cohesion. The 
Regiodeal Southwest will also play a role here.

Bonding within communities
Building social resilience is about promoting 
cohesive neighbourhoods and communities 
where people know and help each other. In 
good times, these social ties are an important 
source for pleasure in life; in adverse times 
they are an unmissable resource to overcome 
setbacks. 

Bridging between communities
It is also  critically important to build cohesion 
between different groups in society. To 
reduce segregation we must encourage that 
people meet and engage with people from 
different parts of our city, as well as people 
of different cultures, nationalities, capacities, 
values, social classes or age.

2. Getting everyone ready for the new economy 

Over the last couple of decades, The Hague has 
lagged behind in growth of jobs and citizens 
compared to other large cities in The Netherlands. 
The Hague’s economy recovered relatively slowly 
after the recent economic crisis (period after 
2010).

The Hague’s economic structure is relatively 
one-sided, and therefore more vulnerable. In 
addition, the number of jobs has not kept up with 
population growth. Economic and technological 
developments such as digitisation require us to 
innovate. We must ensure that people, especially 
our youngest generation, and companies are 
prepared for a new economy.

That is why we have to invest in learning digital skills that are needed in daily 
life. New technologies have the greatest added value when everyone can use 
them. To ensure the digital literacy of our future workforce, more attention 
must be paid to ICT skills in primary and secondary education.

Companies need to be aware of the risks of digitisation. In particular, small 
and medium-sized businesses can take steps to improve digital resilience 
and business continuity. The Hague houses a number of companies and 
institutions from the cyber security sector, for example in the The Hague 
Security Delta (HSD) or in the InnovationQuarter (IQ). The HSD links cyber 
security to the job market by improving the connection between education 
and employers and by attracting and developing talent. The strategy of 
the IQ is, among other things, focused on innovation themes such as Cyber 
Security, Urban Security and critical infrastructure. The municipality links 
companies to these themes.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUETHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUE3. Adapting to climate change 

4. Improving risk awareness and emergency preparedness 

The sea level is rising. That is why we invested 
heavily in our coastal reinforcement over the past 
decade. At present, our coastal defence meets 
the standards until 2050. Nevertheless, due to 
the rising sea level, we must keep our knowledge 
up to date and continue to pay attention to the 
safety and the sea defences. The Hague maintains 
its alignment with the national Delta Programme.

Besides rising sea levels, The Hague’s main 
climate risks relate to extreme events like 
heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and drought. The 
Hague’s infrastructure is built to withstand unruly 
weather; however, climate change creates a new 
normal characterised by unpredictability. We must 
keep working to make our city robust to weather 
conditions that are more extreme or prolonged. 

This is complicated by several factors. First of 
all, over 60% of The Hague is private property. 
This limits the possibilities of local government 
to act and means public-private cooperations are 
essential for climate-proofing our city.

Secondly, climate adaptation will take a considerable amount of financial 
resources. The city must support its interventions with a strong evidence 
base, explore innovative financing approaches, and collaborate with public 
and private stakeholders to innovate.  By realising multiple benefits, some of 
the best climate proofing interventions contribute to the quality of our city 
on every day of the year.

 ̆ More than a third (34%) of the Dutch people do not know 

where the nearest automated external defribillator (AED) is in 
their immediate vicinity.

 ̆ Currently, the Netherlands only has a passive campaign on 

emergency preparedness – citizens have to actively seek for 
information. 

 ̆ Citizens think that the municipality should have a role to inform 

them about risks.

Sources: Dutch Heart Foundation, TNS-NIPO

Ensuring citizens understand key risks and how 
to respond is crucial for resilience. By promoting 
risk-aware behaviours such as contingency 
planning and checking on neighours, citizens 
and businesses become better equipped to help 
themselves and each other. This unlocks much 
needed capacity for response agencies to help 
those who cannot help themselves. 

Risk awareness and emergency preparedness is 
not only about people. We should also make sure 
that our systems, especially those that are critical 
for the functioning of our society, are robust 
to shocks. Protecting critical systems must be 
organised in close collaboration between private 
providers – which manage about 80% of Dutch 
critical infrastructure and services – knowledge 
institutions, local governments and the National 
Government.

The Sand Motor is an artificial peninsula made of sand near The Hague’s coast.It 
uses the energy of the waves,wind, and currents to spread and over time the sea 
spreads the sand over our beaches, protecting our region from the sea. An  
additional benefit is that the Sand Motor has grown into a real hotspot for kite 
surfers and nature lovers.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUETHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYSHOCKS AND STRESSES FOR THE HAGUE5. Engaging partners in the city and beyond 

Complex urban challenges require multiple 
partners to solve. To deliver these multi-
stakeholder solutions, the City of The Hague must 
increase its already strong focus on seeking out 
partnerships across public and private sectors. 
When implementing the initiatives in this strategy 
we should strive to think and act as one.

The 100RC Network offers great opportunities 
to engage in collaborative partnerships with 
Rotterdam and other global resilience leaders. By 
working together, the whole region will benefit 
from one another’s increased resilience.

The Hague’s ongoing journey to become an even more resilient city requires 
us to be humble. We have a great deal of experience we can share with other 
cities in our region and the world, but also we must be ready to learn – from 
other cities, from different sectors, and of course from our own resilient and 
innovative citizens.
Our five resilience opportunities should not be viewed in isolation and are 
often interconnected. We embrace this complexity as it gives the possibility 
for one initiative to link to multiple resilience opportunities and have multiple 
benefits.

To support projected growth, The Hague 
has a many infrastructure projects either 
proposed, planned or under construction. 
What we build now will be in place for 
decades to come, meaning today’s major 
projects provide great possibilities for 
improving our city’s resilience.

Taking a resilience approach to infrastructure 
development means designing systems that 
can withstand, respond to, and adapt more 
readily to shocks and stresses. It also requires 
us to apply resilience principles throughout 
the investment’s whole lifecycle. For example, 
taking an inclusive approach to planning that 
involves stakeholders in decision-making, 
and designing for a range of different future 
scenarios so that systems are flexible to 
changing circumstances.

Resilience thinking in design & delivery

Inclusive: Broadly define project stakeholders and 
prioritise meaningful involvement

Integrated: Think about synergies between 
systems and bring diverse stakeholders together

Flexible: Design and stage projects so 
they can accommodate rapidly changing 
needs and circumstances 

Robust: Create systems that can absorb shocks, 
and continue to function in extreme circumstances.

our city. Many feel they could be even more impactful with 
additional skills.

WHAT?
The School of Shapers, pioneered by Umar Mirza, is a professional 
education programme that further strengthens the shapers and 
connects them with each other.

Resilience 
Opportunities

The School of Shapers provides a platform to connect the 
shapers, expanding their network and strengthening their 
collective thinking power. By bringing our city shapers 
together, the School of Shapers aims to build bridges between 
the different communities they represent.

The School of Shapers will facilitate and encourage ongoing 
cooperation between shapers, leading to a vibrant network of 
alumni. This adds to social cohesion within our city, which is 
essential for our resilience.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

A class of 10 to 15 shapers participates in an 8 to 10 week 
programme that equips and motivates them to take their good 
work to the next level. Experts will train the shapers on topics 
as strategy, media, lobbying, leadership, resilience, marketing, 
management and governance. The shapers are coached on ways to 
implement their learnings into their own community or organisation.

Glasgow: Develop an understanding of what makes 
a strong community leader 

Already the city of Glasgow has pockets of excellent practice where community 
leaders are working effectively to address inequality and increase opportunity. As 
part of its resilience strategy, the city is working to understand what drives this 
best practice and how it can be extended beyond the current reach for the benefit 
of all communities. The result will be briefings and resources which aim to empower 
grassroots leaders to make important decisions that benefit local communities.

In The Hague we take great inspiration from the example of Glasgow. We strongly 
agree that our community leaders are experts on the local shocks and stresses of The 
Hague and are well positioned to help turn these challenges into opportunities.

FUTURE SHOCKS AND STRESSES OF THE HAGUE

Helping individuals and families to increase 
their capacity to respond to shocks and 
stresses.

Our city is only as strong as its people. Fortunately, The 
Hague is full of unique and talented individuals, most of 
whom are able to flourish in good times to grow after 
they experienced a setback. 

Personal resilience is about being risk aware and having 
the social, physical, mental and financial resources and 
capacities to survive and overcome setbacks. However, 
when confronted with daily challenges just to meet basic 
needs, planning for long-term resilience is a luxury some 
cannot afford. 

Our city is one of contrasts, and not all our residents are 
starting from the same place. Physical, mental, social or 
financial conditions are holding some people back. These 
people in particular need help to strengthen their own 
resilience and that of the people around them.

This chapter is about providing residents with 
opportunities to improve their resilience, work on their 
own safety net and develop new skills to respond to 
changes and risks.

This section promotes and proposes initiatives targeted 
at individuals which:

 ̆ Provide lifelong educational opportunities and help people keep up with 

the rapid pace of change.

 ̆ Link people to services they may need in good times and bad.
 ̆ Help our residents overcome problematic debts that undermine their 

resilience.

 ̆ Raise personal awareness of key risks and mitigation strategies.

Montréal’s Resilient  

City Strategy 

Montreal: The Centre for the 
Prevention of Radicalization 
Leading to Violence (CPRLV)

The Centre for the Prevention of Radicalization 
Leading to Violence (CPRLV) is a pioneering 
initiative put forward by Montreal and the first of 
its kind in North America. It is the first independent 
non-profit organization whose objective is to 
prevent radicalisation leading to violence, and 
to support people affected by the phenomenon 
of radicalisation, such as loved ones, teachers, 
professionals, responders, and community outreach 
workers. The CPRLV also works to prevent hate 
crimes and incidents and support victims of such 
acts by ensuring that they receive care.

Illustration: The Hague’s approach to prevent radicalisation and 
polarisation
The Hague applies soft and hard measures in its approach to preventing and countering radicalisation and polarisation. The 
approach acknowledges that polarisation and radicalisation are not just a security challenge – rather, they are societal challenge 
requiring us to tackle key integration challenges like integration, education, employment, participation, and emancipation. 
General measures are complemented by specific, targeted interventions aimed at individuals or groups.

In The Hague the basis for the policy on radicalisation and extremism is based on four focal points: 

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
 

Network and communication
Knowledge and skills
Strengthening social resilience
Tailor made approach, executed through the concept of ‘Safety Houses’.  These are network partnerships that connect  
partners from the criminal justice system, mental healthcare and the Municipality.

1.2 Exploring how we can help 
fathers signal, prevent and  
counter radicalisation

Building on lessons learned from successful programmes in our city, this initiative 
explores how fathers can be part of the collective effort to prevent radicalisation.

WHY?
A growing body of literature suggests that approaches to 
de-radicalisation are more powerful when multiple parties 
work together. The Hague is home to several of those 
multi-stakeholder collaborations, including one aimed at 
strengthening mothers to prevent, signal, and counter 
radicalisation. The idea is that mothers are often one of the first 
to notice if a child becomes susceptible to extremist ideologies. 
Mothers can also play an important role in restoring and/or 
strengthening the the bonds between children and the The 
Hague society.

This reasoning may also apply to fathers. However, The 
Hague currently has no similar initiative aimed at this group. 
They too could be helped with knowledge and tools to 
encourage proactive and appropriate responses to the signs of 
radicalisation.

WHAT?
Helping fathers may come with different challenges and require 
a different approach than working with mothers. To ensure any 
new programme is evidence-based, the City of The Hague will 
support a study into the opportunities, barriers and success 
factors of an initiative aimed at fathers.

SAFE, EMPOWERED PEOPLE SAFE, EMPOWERED PEOPLE WHAT?
Good steps have already been taken in The 
Hague to offer various types of support in an 
integral way. By making use of the resources of 
the 100RC network, such as experts, platform 
partners, and the experience of other cities, 
RTH is investigating the possibilities to further 
strengthen the cooperation between the various 
providers of care and support.

WHO?
Lead: City of The Hague: OCW, SZW
Partners: Multiple partners like housing corporations, welfare 
organisations, volunteer organisations, schools, health care providers, local 
and national government.
WHEN & HOW?
In 2019 the city will investigate new possibilities to further strengthen 
the support of residents with complex problems. For example by providing 
support to help more people and to attract new partners.

Illustration: Intermediary Contact Point
Professionals in our city sometimes encounter citizens with urgent financial or social problems that go beyond their field of 
expertise. In those cases professionals can contact the Intermediary Contact Point (ICP) for consultation. 

After a professional reports a case, the ICP can help secure people’s basic needs with crisis interventions like preventing a house 
eviction or a disconnection from electricity, gas or water. Subsequently the ICP can facilitate an optimal referral to appropriate 
professionals and organisations. 

In 2017, 6,317 reports were received by the ICP, 354 of which were crisis reports. Additionally, the ICP processed 
approximately 12,400 phone calls from and to professionals on consultation and advisory matters.

1.3 Support for citizens with 
complex problems

A city is only as resilient as its most vulnerable people. For people with complex 
and interrelated problems, the effectiveness of these efforts is greater when 
services, teams and organisations work together.

WHY?
Socioeconomic and psychosocial challenges are often 
interrelated and can severely compromise one’s health, ability 
to manage a household, finding and maintaining employment, 
studying, and maintaining relationships. This limits financial and 
social capability to participate in society on a day-to-day basis. 
Things become even more difficult when confronted with a 
major setback.

In households in The Hague with children:

 ̆ 24,000 families with socioeconomic problems
 ̆ Almost 9,000 families where the parents have 

psychosocial problems

 ̆ 7,500 families where the children have psychosocial 

problems.

Source: Dutch Statistics / Dutch Youth Institute 2017

Various municipal services and teams work with organisations 
in the city on solutions that ensure stability, improve well-
being, increase self-reliance and increase the ability of people 
to participate in our society. In complex cases, support is most 
effective when these parties make a joint and coordinated effort. 
This is not only in the interest of people in need of help, but also 
has great value for the city as a whole.

‘It takes a city to solve debt’. Building residents’ financial and social resources 
to improve quality of life and adaptability to shocks and stresses. 

The Debt Lab 070 (Schuldenlab070) has been set up to work on a debt-free The Hague. In the Debt Lab 070, over 25 
private and public partners, including the Municipality of The Hague, work together to develop, pilot, and evaluate solutions 
for debt and poverty. The Debt Lab 070 uses innovative instruments to finance some of the solutions like social impact 
bonds. Their motto ‘it takes a city to solve debt’ reflects their integral approach towards preventing and curing problematic 
debt. Recently this initiative in The Hague has been scaled to the national level, named as SchuldenLabNL.

Do you need financial help or support? Then contact one of the eight district offices in The Hague.

Reclassering Nederland, Society Impact, De Haagse Hogeschool, SVB, HTM, Vestia, CTH en de ING Bank.

Deputy Mayor Bert van Alphen:

“Poverty is one of the last taboos in the Netherlands. People often find it difficult to admit 
to being in poverty, which makes it more difficult to help them. It is important to remove 
the taboos that surround poverty and debt.”

Illustration: Social Hospital 
An estimated 3,000 families in The Hague receive help from multiple different care providers due to a combination of financial, 
social and health problems. The coordination of the integral services is complex and often leads to sub-optimal collaboration and 
sub-optimal use of resources. Sociaal Hospitaal, one of the projects from Debt Lab 070, helps these families navigate bureaucratic 
processes and find applicable care providers and financial subsidies. The aim is optimise care for families that need it the most.

The Social Hospital is funded by a Health Impact Bond. This is a ‘pay for success’ contract in which a private investor, in this case 
health insurer CZ, finances the project. When the predetermined results are achieved, the Municipality of The Hague repays the 
investor with interest reflective of the benefits generated.

Partners: CZ, City of The Hague, Social Hospital, School voor Publieke Waarden

Illustration: Youth Perspective 
Fund (Jongeren perspectief 
fonds)
Another initiative of the Debt Lab 070 is the Youth 
Perspective Fund (JPF). This initiative focuses on young 
people aged 18 to 27 with problematic debt. 

The JPF offers participants a personalised debt-relief 
program. In return they must agree to a personal recovery 
plan, including a statement that he or she goes to school or 
work. Depending on their income, participants partly re-
pay their debt in kind by doing a social internship. 
To offer a sustainable solution for their finances, participants 
get a coach that helps with the execution of the recovery 
plan. They also follow courses to manage their finances. This 
prevents a relapse into problematic debt, saving society 
future costs for home eviction or social help for example.

The City of The Hague financed the start-up of this 
initiative. Since 2017 private investors (Aegon and ING) 
also contribute financially.  
 
Partners: Aegon, City of The Hague, ING, Society Impact

Illustration: Amargi 
Amargi – another Debt Lab 070 initiative – uses the 
power of volunteers to help low-income citizens make 
ends meet and pinpoint opportunities for savings.

Together with a volunteer, the participant draws up a 
budget plan and checks whether all possible sources of 
income support are used. The volunteer provides tools to 
help the participants stick to the budget plan. An example 
is to introduce the participant to a two-account system, 
with one account for living expenses and the other 
for fixed expenses and savings. Creditors are asked to 
intervene quickly by contacting people that miss required 
payments.

(The Hague Buddies) 
Using the power of volunteers, Haagse Makkers guides, empowers and 
encourages newcomers to fully participate in the city.

The Hague is home to several buddy networks that connect volunteers to people who could use some extra support. Buddy 
networks align perfectly with the principles of resilience because they enable residents to participate as independently as possible and 
contribute to an inclusive and connected society.

Haagse Makkers, an initiative by SamenHaags, is an example of a buddy network that specifically targets people that have immigrated 
from abroad. Newcomers can use an app that connects them to a Haagse Makker (The Hague Buddy) based on their profile and 
shared interests. The buddy introduces the newcomer to The Hague and to his or her own network. Getting familiar with the city goes 
hand in hand with practicing Dutch language skills.

By doing things together, speaking Dutch and getting to know the city, this initiative contributes to making newcomers feel at home.

Lead: City of The Hague: SamenHaags

1.6 Weekend and  
Summer Schools

By promoting equality of opportunity, weekend and summer schools help to 
unlock all the potential in our youth.
One of The Hague’s top educational ambitions is to offer all children – regardless of their background – the opportunity to get the 
best out of themselves during their entire education. Parents, schools, programs on pre-schooling and early childhood education and 
extracurricular initiatives all play important roles. 

The Hague is home to several weekend and summer schools and so-called neighbourhood universities. Some offer extra lessons in 
language and math skills, while others aim to broaden children’s horizons by letting them discover their talents and expand their world 
(meeting people, seeing places).

Weekend schools, summer schools and neighbourhood universities promote the equality of opportunity for children and contribute 
to the social capital of our city. The Hague will continue to look for other opportunities and initiatives that link to these objectives.

Lead: Several weekend and summer schools, neighbourhood universities, primary and secondary schools.

Deputy Mayor Robert van Asten:
“All children deserve equality of educational opportunities. 
And teaching at a weekend school is great fun.”

Innovation House (TIH)

Bringing together the right tools and expertise under one roof to build 21st 
century skills.

TIH works together with students and the business community to help young people keep up with fast-emerging 
innovations. Within this project, students develop skills that link to virtual reality, robotisation, 3D printing and ‘serious 
gaming’. Students apply their knowledge and skills to real case studies. The project also offers companies a chance to use 
thinking power of young students to address their current challenges.

TIH is itself an innovative building equipped with state-of-the-art equipment. It combines the resources of four 
departments of  ROC Mondriaan: Technology and ICT; Construction and Infrastructure; Metal, Electrical and Installations, 
and Automotive and Mobility. 

The TIH also is a place where students are trained on new technologies by experts from the private sector and ROC 
Mondriaan. This initiative is focused on secondary education, although it may be expanded to primary education as well.

Lead: City of The Hague: OCW, ROC Mondriaan, local companies and start-ups. Funded by the Ministry of Education 
Culture and Science.   

1.8 Maker Education

Inventors in the making! Investing in 21st century skills like computational 
thinking prepares our youth to contribute to a future-proof economy.

WHY & WHAT?
Innovations like 3D printing are rapidly reshaping industries 
from food production to textile-fabrication and construction. 
Traditional jobs in these industries are likely to change. Without 
taking action,we will not be able to leverage all the new job 
opportunities that come with these innovations. 

The creative industry is getting more important for our 
economy. Technologies like 3D printing and programmable 
electronics make it easier to turn an idea into reality. 
MakerEducation is an extracurricular activity that offers 
children the opportunity to experiment with different 
technologies, turning them from consumers into inventors. This 
boosts 21st century skills and potentially attracts more girls to 
the technology field. In this way we continue the tradition of 
the Netherlands as a “making and design” country.

these strong initiatives and possibly integrate them in 
the curriculum of primary schools in The Hague.

1.9 Preparing children for a  
digital future

Digital technology is becoming increasingly important. There are several 
successful initiatives that prepare the new generation for a digital economy. 
Building on these efforts, this initiative will explore how these inspiring projects 
can reach more children in The Hague.

WHY & WHAT?
The Hague has become a hub for innovative initiatives aimed 
at preparing younger generations for a rapidly evolving digital 
future. These projects bring together school children where 
they can learn new skills and experiment together. The overall 
aim is to help children to become enterprising, creative and 
socially involved citizens who will be the future safeguards of 
the resilience of our city. It is essential that these initiatives 
reach many more children from The Hague.

 ̆ CoderDojo is a non-profit global movement, set up 
in Ireland by James Whelton and Bill Liao. It brings 
together 5-17 year old children who are taken through 
the steps of programming and app making by volunteer 
mentors. 

 ̆ FutureMindz has been designed and realised together 

with the schools and the Municipality of the Hague. 
This initiative provides design and guidance for a 
customisable series of lessons on gamification and 21st 
century skills. This includes activities such as drone 
races, a two-day team activity to solve cyber-related 
problems and a skills camp where children can play with 
the latest technologies in a team.   

Deputy Mayor Saskia Bruines:
“It is of great importance that children become familiar with 
the digital world from an early age.“

movement, which is also active in The Hague, Vejle’s FABlab@
schoolsdk initiative provides pupils with an insight into the jobs 
of the future, allowing them to see themselves as designers and 
problem solvers.

In The Hague we firmly agree that investing in children’s digital 
skills is a key lever for resilience. Lessons learned from Vejle can 
be applied to the Maker Education programme.

health with digital technologies

Emerging technologies can help older residents live healthier, more active and 
independent lives. This initiative works with older residents to understand 
their needs and trial a range of new technological tools.

An ageing population means the percentage of our population requiring special assistance is increasing.
iZi Gezond Lang Thuis (iZi), in collaboration with residents, plans to find social and technological solutions to the daily tasks 
of elderly people, which will enable them to stay healthy and to live independently in their own homes. Examples include 
new forms of personal alarm systems, remote controlled lighting and window openers, social and household robots, and 
tablets and smartphones for seniors. The project will be delivered based on wishes and needs of elderly people.About 150 
elderly residents trial a number of systems, devices and adjustments. Based on their feedback, favourite concepts will be 
further developed.

Lead: City of The Hague: OCW, Smart City

Partner: Leiden University, HaagWonen, TU Delft, World Startup Factory, The Hague University of Applied Science, Xtra

Deputy Mayors Kavita Parbhudayal and Saskia Bruines thank the participants 
for their contribution to the iZi program, which won the World Smart City Award prize.

1.10 Computer skills for 
elderly people

Ensuring access to digital technology for all is a key ingredient for an inclusive 
society. Elderly residents deserve extra attention. This initiative empowers them 
with skills to enjoy the benefits offered by digitisation.

WHY?
Elderly people are one of the most vulnerable groups in a 
digitalised society. Some find adapting to digital technology 
very difficult, placing them at a disadvantage and potentially 
cutting them off from valuable services.

WHAT?
The Central Library of The Hague, with the support of the 
MOOI foundation, offers two hour courses to help elderly 
people develop basic computer and technology-related skills. 
These courses are offered at a very low price. Participants learn 
how to use computers, tablets and apps to send emails, use 
various e-government services and to fill in online forms. 

The intention is to scale up the project and ensure that it is 
attractive and available to as many people as possible.

resilience in children’s education

Efforts to address climate adaptation in our city will not be successful without 
our future leaders. Through hands-on activities encouraging behavourial change, 
children will gain practical insights and inspiration to climate-proof the city.

WHY & WHAT?
Natuur en Milieu Educatie (NME) uses education to create 
support among citizens of The Hague for sustainability. The 
city farms have an important role.

NME offers toolbox that actively involves pupils in climate 
adaptation. One of the items in the toolbox is a model of a city 
known as a “water table”.  With a watering can, students simulate 
rain. They soon realise that it is difficult to prevent flooding in an 
urban environment. Then they make adjustments themselves to 
increase the water storage capacity. This provides insight into the 
effects of measures that the municipality is taking in this area. 

Further research will be done together with NME, RTH and 
Museon to investigate how we can add additional tools to the 
toolbox, such as a ‘serious game’ and information regarding 
resilience and climate adaptation.

NME reaches about 32.000 children. City farms are 
visited about 425.000 times in the Netherlands.

WHO?
Lead:  City of The Hague: DSB NME, Museon and RTH

communities where people support

We are the home of ‘Haagse kracht’ (The Hague 
Strength). This strength is founded on the capacities 
of our people and the bonds in our society. While this 
chapter is partly about creating greener, more functional 
places to live, it is also an invitation for our citizens to 
take the Haagse kracht to the next level by strengthening 
their bonds within and outisde their neighbourhood.

Bonds based around shared traits and interests are only

city of ‘dividing lines’ where segregation exists between 
different communities. If we want to maintain and grow 
the the social capital of The Hague, we must increase our 
efforts to break down segregation and use innovative 
approaches to encourage new connections. 

Our personal networks provide social capital that 
is crucial for resilience. On the one hand, we bond 
with others who live nearby, share our interests, or 
have similar demographic characteristics. These links 
contribute to our happiness during good times, and 
when faced with major disruption these bonds provide 
invaluable support networks. However, this is not the 
case for all the people of The Hague; for example, some 
older residents and recent migrants may feel distant from 
social networks.

This chapter proposes a range of initiatives aimed at 
building more cohesive neighbourhoods and communities, 
but their success relies on you getting involved. When 
our social networks combine, it forms our city’s greatest 
resilience asset.

As our city grows, we are also redeveloping entire 
neighbourhoods, such as the Binckhorst. We must make 
sure these places are created in a way that encourages 
cohesion from the start.

This section promotes and proposes initiatives targeted at 
neighbourhoods which:

 ̆ Create new opportunities for people to build meaningful and lasting 

personal connections.

 ̆ Foster more risk-aware communities that can help one another in 

times of shock and stress.

 ̆ Create greener places that can withstand extreme weather.
 ̆ Use proposed infrastructure developments as a lever for revitalising 

communities.

THE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYTHE HAGUE RESILIENCE STRATEGYTo improve our knowledge on the way transportation projects are 
conceived, planned, implemented, used and monitored, The Hague 
applied successfully to 100RC and Columbia University to host a 
Resilience Accelerator in Southwest. Accelerators involve workshops 
and input from world-class researchers to integrate resilience thinking 
into projects. It gives us an opportunity to more effectively plan 
transportation infrastructure that learns from past mistakes, anticipates 
on future trends, builds a coalition across fields, and brings multiple 
benefits to its residents.

The Accelerator has so far drawn attention towards the importance 
of community participation in the process of becoming a Resilient 
Southwest. Building from the preliminary results, we will draw upon 
case studies to assess which participatory approach is most likely to 
work in South West.

WHO?
Lead: Municipality of The Hague, DPZ, OCW, SZW, DSB, 
DSO, BSD, RTH, Columbia University

Partners: neighbourhood residents; all Region Deal 
partners; Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality; 
HHS; STIPO –placemaking; 100RC; Rockefeller Foundation.

WHEN & HOW?
 ̆ The Hague was selected by 100 Resilient Cities and 
Columbia University to host a Resilience Accelerator 
in Southwest.

 ̆ In September 2018, the Resilient Southwest 
Programme Team organised a workshop with 
Columbia University, followed by a community 
dinner in November 2018 with citizens of 
Southwest as part of the Resilient Accelerator. 

 ̆ In the first half of 2019, the regional deal 
implementation will kick off, and Columbia 
University will present the findings of case study 
research.

 ̆ In the second half of 2019, the Resilient Southwest 

Programme Team will begin to integrate findings 
from research and community participation into a 
vision for a more resilient Southwest.

WHAT?
An ambitious and integrated approach is urgently needed to counter 
the downward spiral in Southwest. This is explicitly supported by the 
coalition agreement 2018- 2022 and the National Government 
that will support the Regional Deal for Southwest that will improve 
schooling, safety, work and prosperity in Southwest.

The City of The Hague is exploring the construction of a fast public 
transport connection from The Hague Central Station to The Hague 
Southwest. As the project is still in an exploratory phase, it presents 
an unrivalled opportunity to demonstrate how major transportation 
projects – when developed with a resilience approach (see page 
34) – are about so much more than getting people from point A to 
point B. In Southwest, we believe this investment can be a catalyst 
for improvement against a range of stresses, such as limited access to 
private investment and employment opportunities. Improvement of 
accessibility of Southwest will also improve the attractiveness for high 
and middle income households.

Construction of this new corridor with a stop in Southwest District 
presents set of challenges that can be informed by past and ongoing 
major transportation projects:  how can we build transportation 
infrastructure that maximises the benefit to those who need it 
most, minimises harm to the environment, is robust to the future 
stresses and shocks, and most of all, sets a framework for sustainable, 
equitable and resilient growth for our cities?

Medellin: Elevated 
metro system to 
contributing to a 
safer city
Medellin’s elevated metro 
system, completed in the mid-
1990s, was augmented in 2006 
and 2008 with the addition of 
two Metrocable lines. These 
cable cars, which climb both sides of the valley in which 
Medellín sits, travel deep into formerly difficult-to-reach 
favelas (shanty towns) that are located in the surrounding 
hills. By providing an affordable new connection, the metro 
famously played a pivotal role in reducing violence and 
segregation in Medellín. It also offers visitors possibly the 
least expensive but most comprehensive and photogenic 
city tour in the world.

This initiative of Metrocable shows how modern 
infrastructure can provide truly cross-cutting resilience 
benefits, such as improved safety, social inclusion, access 
to opportunity and environmental sustainability. Lessons 
from Medellin and many other cities in the 100RC network 
will help The Hague in planning and delivery of new 
infrastructure such as the corridor to Southwest.

2.1 Resilient Southwest:  
public transportation as an  
accelerator for neighbourhood 
development

The Hague Southwest is a large district facing multiple challenges. A fast public 
transportation corridor is explored that will improve the connection of Southwest 
to the city and region. This initiative is about using this proposed project as a 
lever to establish an integrated vision for a resilient Southwest.

WHY?
The Hague Southwest (Zuidwest) is a large district (population 
of about 70,000; comparable to the municipality of Gouda) 
with a range of urgent socioeconomic challenges. This includes 
poverty, debts due to long-term unemployment, polarisation, 
growing numbers of disadvantaged young people, and low 
social cohesion. Many residents report feeling unsafe in their 
own neighbourhood and almost half of people are struggling to 
make ends meet.

Significant investments in physical infrastructure – including 
housing, public space and public transport – will also be needed 
in the area in the next 10 years. Ageing, outdated social 
housing comprises 65% of housing stock in the area; upgrades 
are needed to bring more differentiation and improve  
quality of life.

co-living and co-working
With this innovative co-housing and co-working initiative, The Hague 
facilitates professional and social integration for young refugees. 
Located in the former building of the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, SOZA offers an innovative form of co-housing 
for status holders (refugees with a permit to stay and work in the Netherlands), students, and young professionals. It also offers room 
for sports, social support, and social enterprises.

The aim is to create a unique environment where social initiatives, businesses and residents connect and create a vibrant community. 
Combined with tailored social assistance, this puts status holders in a good position to build their new lives and participate in The 
Hague’s society. 

The SOZA building is an innovative public-private collaboration between the Municipality of The Hague and VORM and MRP 
Development, two private real estate development companies.

Lead: SOZA 

Partners: MRPD, VORM, Municipality of The Hague: OCW, Gapph

Illustration: ANNA & Co
SOZA is home to ANNA & Co, an initiative from the 
Municipality of The Hague that connects residents to 
creative entrepreneurs and community projects. By offering 
a co-working space with offices, meeting rooms, a living 
room and weekly events, ANNA & Co creates opportunities 
for status holders, students and entrepreneurs to meet and 
work together, enabling them to build a network, exchange 
knowledge, apply for a job  or develop entrepreneurial skills. 
It makes the residents part of a larger social community and 
strengthens their connection to our city.  

As part of the initiative ‘mijn buuf’ (my neighbor), women get 
together and produce bags from recycled materials which are 
sold at SOZA and also send with a personal message to the 
asylum centres in Greece in collaboration with the Foundation 
Movement on the Ground. Women who show strong 
business skills or interest can receive further support from 
entrepreneurs at ANNA & Co around potentially establishing 
their own business.

Partners include: ANNA Vastgoed & Cultuur, My Buuf, 
Dutch Language Café, Meraki, Migrant Inc.

Illustration: It takes a village
VORM and MRPD invest in a SOZA-based programme called 
‘It takes a village’, which includes a range of projects that 
benefit SOZA residents and The Hague. 

In the Netherlands, 8.7% of the population has a valid First 
Aid certificate.2 To both expand the number of people 
with first aid training in the city, and help status holders 
to participate and contribute to The Hague society, SOZA 
organises First Aid trainings for status holders and employees 
of the Horeca Academie (Hospitality Academy). A first aid 
certificate can increase the chances of getting a job, helps 
the participants to become more self-reliant, and also makes 
them important contributors to resilience as they know how 
to help when a fellow citizen is unwell.

In pop-up sport lessons, residents from SOZA, as well as 
people from surrounding neighbourhoods, participate in 
different sport activities, like bootcamp, boxing and fitness. 
The lessons are not only great for promoting active lifestyles, 
but also for connecting neighbourhood and SOZA residents.

SOZA Dinner Times are networking dinner parties with a 
specific theme. Each evening is programmed by a different 
partner from the city of The Hague, who invites their 
network as well as SOZA residents who have an affinity with 
the theme. These events help to increase the network of 
both status holders and the partner organisation, creating the 
potential for powerful new connections.

A great recipe for a more cohesive neighbourhood!

Using the power of cooking and eating together, Resto VanHarte is reducing isolation and increasing social cohesion in our 
neigbourhoods.

In neighbourhood restaurants, local residents cook and eat together, get to know each other, provide affordable meals, and 
contribute to a liveable neighbourhood. Some restaurants even grow their own vegetables. The Restos are run by a small team of 
professionals, but the real driving forces are the volunteers.

Resto VanHarte is a success formula. The first restaurant opened in The Hague in 2005 and by 2018 it had expanded to over 25 
cities in the Netherlands. Resto VanHarte has also developed programmes for children from different neighbourhoods in The Hague 
and is looking into opportunities for cooking classes.

2.4 The Schilderswijk  
Mothers

Reaching out to isolated women: inclusivity in 
action.

Our city is home to many residents, volunteers, and professionals that support 
vulnerable people. One of the challenges is to reach people that live their life in 
relative isolation. 

The Schilderswijk Mothers is one of our city’s initiatives aimed specifically 
at women with little or no social network. About twenty professionally 
trained and coached volunteers support and activate women in the 
various communities of the Schilderswijk. They provide a listening ear, give 
practical support to participate in society, and if needed refer people to the 
organisations that provide further assistance. The Schilderswijk Mothers can 
be the bridge between government, social services and these women.

Lead: Neighbourhood centre De Mussen

 ̆ The Schilderswijk Mothers have 

activated and supported over 
1000 women over the past five 
years.

 ̆ More than 80% of the women 

they have reached have climbed 
one or more steps on the 
participation ladder (see figure).

 ̆ Between 80% and 90% of women 
are referred to additional support.

of the Schilderswijk Mothers 
programme outweigh the costs

Neighbourhood project 

It takes a village to raise a child! Expanding a successful school programme

The Peaceful Neighbourhood project was derived from the Peaceful School program, which teaches children a range of social and civic 
competences such as solving conflict situations, bridging differences, and taking responsibility for their communities. The Peaceful 
Neighbourhood initiative takes the principles from the school-level programme and expands it to a neighbourhood level.
The project works with key people and organisations that are in contact with children, for example sports coaches, shop owners, 
police officers, playground management, social workers, librarians and parents.

In 2018, The Hague neighbourhoods Vrederust and Kortenbos joined the Peaceful Neighbourhood initiative. Other neighborhoods in 
The Hague may follow.

2.6 Social internship  
programme for new police  
officers (Culturele Wasstraat)

An innovative programme that helps police officers build relationships with 
their community.
Police officers can be more effective when they have trusted relationships with the people in the districts where they work. 
However, good relations do not come naturally. Police work often revolves around responding to emergencies and by itself is 
not enough to connect the police to The Hague society. Police work often revolves around law enforcement and responding 
to emergencies; by itself is not enough to connect the police to The Hague society. 

The Hague police has increased their efforts to improve their relationship with the public. A successful example is the social 
internship programme for new police officers in the City Centre District. Run by The Hague Police Unit, the programme offers 
new police officers the opportunity to undertake a two week introduction programme within the local community. 

This includes introductory meetings with schools, religious organisations, youth groups, mental health services, and a range 
of other social services.  This approach enables the police officers to have a greater contextual understanding of their district 
while winning trust from the community. In 2017, the Social Internship programme was awarded a prize for the best police 
project in the Netherlands.

greening The Hague

By reducing the amount of street tiles and trading them for plants, the city 
will be more robust against extreme weather events. It also creates a more 
healthy living environment for the citizens of The Hague.

The Hague is a dense city with paved areas, 50 – 60% of which are privately owned. The City of The Hague encourages greening 
of these spaces through a range of initiatives, including participating in a nationwide project called Operatie Steenbreek. This 
project focuses on increasing the amount of green in the city by replacing street tiles with plants..

This is done during trading events and at street tile collection points throughout the city, at which street tiles are traded for free 
plants. Citizens, schools and companies are welcome to participate. Since the start of the project in 2015, 76,000 thousands 
street tiles have been collected.

The Hague aims to increase the impact of Operatie Steenbreek in our city to contribute to the green spaces in our city. 

2.9 Urban Water Buffer

Innovation to tackle the challenges of flooding and secure fresh 
water supplies.
Our city is at risk from both too much and not enough water. We are aware of the increasing risk of rainfall flooding, but in the 
future we may also be prone to water shortages due to longer droughts. The necessary space for retention and infiltration of water 
in urban areas is usually scarce, which leads to costly solutions and/or conflicts with other above-ground functions.

Pilots with Urban Water Buffers in The Hague, Rotterdam and Rheden, will lead to a better understanding on how retaining more 
water in our urban areas can address flood risk and improve water supplies. The intention is that this initiative will lead to evidence-
based interventions in future, making a positive contribution to resilience in The Hague and beyond. Further research is necessary 
on the pilot site in the Schilderswijk in The Hague.

A Tiny Forest is a dense, indigenous forest the size of a tennis court. It is not 
only important for butterflies, birds, bees and small mammals, but also for 
people.

Children can learn about Dutch nature in the outdoor classroom and local 
residents meet there. Tiny forests contribute to a biodiverse and climate-
proof environment, while also helping citizens come closer to nature and 
each other. The Institute for Nature Education and Sustainability (IVN) 
will develop 100 Tiny Forests in the Netherlands. Plans are underway to 
develop at least two of such spaces in The Hague over the next three years.

Illustration: AEDs in City Farms
In the Netherlands, there are 35 deaths from a cardiac 
arrest every day. An automated external defibrillator (AED) 
increases the chances of survival to 70%.

In collaboration with Fonds1818, the Hartstichting 
(foundation for heart diseases), and Firma van Ginderen, each 
city farm in The Hague installed an AED. They are placed in an 
exterior cabin which makes them accessible 24/7.

The AEDs at the city farms not only improve the safety 
and preparedness for emergency situations, but also raise 
awareness of the importance of a nearby AED in case of a 
cardiac arrest.

Illustration: Red Cross home

Taking some small, often simple steps can significantly 
improve the resilience of your home. The Dutch Red Cross 
offers free home visits to help vulnerable people prepare 
their homes for unexpected events.

Aided by a checklist, a volunteer helps the resident to 
identify potential hazards and take preventive action. 

This may involve installing smoke detectors and other 
fire safety measures, checking and securing rugs and 
cables, sharing tips to prevent burglary, making an 
emergency communication plan or stocking supplies for an 
emergency. RTH will look into the opportunity to expand 
the impact of the home visits in The Hague.

2.10 Connecting communities 
and experts to improve and 
target risk communication

Risks are experienced and prioritised differently across our society.  
Communication aimed at increasing risk awareness and emergency preparedness 
should therefore be tailored to specific neighbourhood characteristics. This 
initiative provides a platform that connects communities and experts to achieve 
mutual benefits: increased awareness ,better preparedness, and improved risk 
communication techniques.

WHY?
Preparing for emergencies first requires our citizens to be 
aware about potential risks and how to respond. However, 
exposure to shocks risks like flooding, extreme heat and civil 
unrest is not evenly distributed across the city. Unevenly 
distributed chronic stresses, such as poverty or health risks, 
can also affect the capacity of citizens to adapt. 

In addition, variations in demographic and social characteristics 
– like age, languages, culture and social cohesion – can affect 
how risk information is shared and processed. These local 
differences limit the effectiveness of a general city-wide 
approach.

Engagement undertaken for Resilient Sydney revealed serious community concern over 
a lack of community preparedness for emergencies. Community members also showed 
awareness of the need to strengthen local connections to ensure support and safety is close 
by during disasters. The number of households in Sydney taking action to prepare for shocks 
is unknown and effort is required to encourage take up and report results.

This initiative is aimed at tailoring risk communication to 
specific areas and target groups.

In response, the Red Cross and IAG co-created the Get Prepared app. The app is a free and 
easy to use, one-stop tool to help community members prepare for any type of emergency.

BART! is a digital platform designed to connect police, citizens, and the 
municipality to create a safer living environment in Escamp and Ypenburg. 

Today, many local residents communicate with each other via digital neighbourhood groups on WhatsApp, Facebook or special 
neighbourhood apps such as Next Door, Veilige Buurt, MijnBuur and Waaksamen. Local residents share information about liveability, 
crime, lost and found objects and other information that is relevant to the neighbourhood. BART! contributes to the ability of 
residentsto take action themselves and to work together on the liveability and safety of their neighbourhoods.

When neighbourhood challenges cannot be solved by residents themselves, they can also use BART! to send messages, photos or 
video anonymously to the police or municipality. Additionally, the municipality and the police can also make use of the information 
that is being shared on the neighbourhood platforms. BART! uses algorithms to condense the vast amount of information in 
neighbourhood apps into manageable proportions. It supports municipal or police centralists to respond timely and effectively to solve 
neighbourhood issues that go beyond the field of influence of the residents. The municipality and police can also communicate with 
the group members.

By creating a testbed for innovative security techniques, International Zone 
The Hague maintains the security of international organisations while improving 
liveability for local residents.
WHY & WHAT?
The Hague is the fourth major centre for the United Nations 
after New York, Geneva and Vienna. In some of these cities the 
international district is isolated and remote from residential areas, 
but in the Hague it is located in a residential neighbourhood.

 ̆ Eye and Ear experiment: Trialling video cameras 
with acoustic sensors for better and more efficient 
observation in the World Forum area.

 ̆ Web monitoring of World Forum area: Continuous 

monitoring of internet and social media to signal threats 
in time.

Sometimes security measures required for major events can 
significantly affect accessibility and liveability. This happened 
during the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) in 2014, which led to 
establishment in 2015 of the Integral Area Security International 
Zone (IGIZ) innovation program. It has the aim of improving 
security in The Hague’s International Zone while maintaining an 
optimal balance between security, location, climate, quality of 
life and appearance. With its integrated and holistic approach, the 
programme creates a unique living lab where innovative security 
techniques and new partnerships can be trialled. Some examples 
include:

ensuring our critical city-wide systems are 
robust, inclusive and flexible. This includes 
creating legal and technological solutions 
to protect our citizens from the risks of 
digitisation, including cyberattacks and

For centuries political power in The Netherlands has 
resided in The Hague. However, our city’s legacy is 
not one of power at any cost. Rather, The Hague has 
attracted purpose-driven organisations from all over 
the world, along with courts seeking to protect the 
fundamental rights of all the world’s citizens. Our city’s 
global reputation is one of peace and justice. 

Maintaining our reputation means confronting existing 
and emerging threats to our city’s built and natural 
systems, such as cybercrime, extremist acts and climate 
change. Tackling these issuess will require some major 

investments in infrastructure, social structures and digital 
developments. Regardless of the intervention, we will 
always take an evidence-based approach that prioritises 
adaptability and flexibility, seeks to achieve multiple 
benefits, and always considers the effects on the more

We strive to be a strong and just city for all the people of 
The Hague. 

This section promotes and proposes city-scale initiatives which:

 ̆ Apply a systems approach to reducing our exposure and vulnerability 

to major shocks, such as cyberattacks and floods. 

 ̆ Trial new ways of working that improve our preparedness for climate 

change.

 ̆ Tackle behaviours that undermine the fairness and stability of our

Sharing relevant information and building strong networks are 
key to tackling subversive crime. This is the primary objective

directors from different departments, it creates an internal 
platform where they can meet on a regular basis and discuss 
cross-departmental issues and possibilities to prevent and/or 
reduce subversive crime like connecting data sources or create 
barriers for criminals.

For external coordination three district undermining 
roundtables have been started in The Hague (one for each

and other partners meet to assess signals of subversive crime, 
and identify how to fight specific cases.

3.1 The Hague Economic  
Intervention Team (HEIT)
Subversive crime weakens the foundations of our society. The Hague 
responds with an integrated approach.

Like most other cities in The Netherlands, The Hague has experienced a drop in registered and reported crime. Feelings of safety and 
security have also improved in recent years. 

While appreciating these positive trends, we must also recognise there are types of crime that are less visible but still disruptive to 
society. Think of money laundering, cannabis cultivation and fraudulent businesses. Criminal money flowing into the regular economy 
can compromise the business climate, as well as harm institutions and networks that underpin our resilience, such as social networks 
and the criminal justice system. These practices are hard to detect and their effects are even harder to reverse. The Hague Economic 
Intervention Team (HEIT) is an effective response to these challenges. The main task of the team is to detect and end fraudulent 
business activities and abuses related to prostitution. The HEIT methodology has two pillars:

1. 
 
2. 
 

A multi-stakeholder approach, joining the authorisations, competence and expertise of various partners from the local and   
national government.
The administrative approach, which allows immediate inspections and rapid interventions while still leading to substantial  
measures for the offenders. 

 

Each year the HEIT performs hundreds of inspections. The visibility of the inspections is a key tool for encouraging compliance – they 
communicate that the city of The Hague does not tolerate activities that weaken our social fabric.

Lead and partners: The HEIT is a collaboration between various network partners, such as the Dutch Tax Authorities, the Social 
Affairs and Employment Inspectorate, Dutch Customs, the police and various departments of the city of The Hague, and 27 other 
municipalities in the region. Depending on the situation, HEIT may also involve other parties such as energy companies, the Dutch 
Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA), Environmental Services and the Dutch Forensic Institute (NFI).

Illustration: Use of Big Data to investigate trends and patterns in 
subversive crime
Providing stakeholders with up-to-date knowledge on criminal use of real estate is a key tool for fighting subversive crime. The 
Hague does this by partnering with other Dutch cities, the National government and Statistics Netherlands in the research project: 
‘City Deal: Perspective on subversive crime’ (Zicht op Ondermijning).  

By linking data from multiple sources, patterns in the data are identified that might indicate an elevated risk of money laundering 
or other criminal activities. This leads to insights into the nature and scope of criminal activities, and into the branches and 
neighbourhoods where they take place.

Atlanta: Cyber resilience in an increasingly smart city

Atlanta is increasingly relying on smart technology to streamline and enhance city 
services using real-time data. These smart systems combine hardware, software, and 
geospatial analytics to make our communities more digitally connected and improve 
our quality of life. Atlanta is working to improve its overall security posture by building 
an information security program that improves threat and vulnerability-management 
capabilities for both information and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) 
systems.

A recent major cyber attack against Atlanta emphasises the urgency for The Hague to 
work on the cyber resilience and security of our digital infrastructure. 

3.2 The Hague Cyber Resilience 
Community Platform 

To ensure our communities and businesses’ preparedness for inevitable cyber 
attacks, this platform promotes sharing up-to-date information on cyber security 
and ensures that we reflect on and learn from past experiences.    

WHY?
Nations, cities, municipalities and businesses world-wide 
are experiencing cyber attacks at an increasing rate. As 
cyberattack methods are continually evolving, one of 
the major challenges is to quickly provide relevant and 
accurate information. With attack methods becoming more 
sophisticated, implementing effective cybersecurity measures 
is also increasingly costly, particularly for smaller organisations 
with limited resources.

Private-public partnerships are an essential part of the solution 
in this dynamic environment. While large organisations have 
their own ICT department or are supported by the National 
Cyber Security Center, SMEs and citizens sometimes are 
not well enough informed about how to increase their digital 
resilience.

WHAT?
There is a need for an improved exchange of information on 
cyber security, to improve preparedness and response to a 
cybe rattack. The Hague Cyber Resilience Community Platform  
will explore what is needed to improve the cyber security of 
organisations and citizens in The Hague with a focus on improved 
information exchange. The outcome will be resources that not 
only boost the cyber security of an organisation, but also will 
decrease the cost of acquiring this information. 
   
Through additional research we will ensure that this platform 
meets the needs of the target groups. We will learn from other 
cities in the G5 Smart City network, in which The Hague takes 
the lead in the Safety and Security topic.

Cyber security is an important point of attention in our increasingly digital society. Entrepreneurs must be able to do business safely 
and consumers must be able to use digital services and products safely. P@CT is a collaboration between schools, the government 
and the cyber security sector in the region of The Hague. P@CT contributes to the development of vocational training programs.  The 
students of today are the cyber security experts of tomorrow. In the coming years, P@CT will continue to grow into a sustainable 
cooperation platform that is part of The Hague Security Delta, the regional network organization for cyber security. 

Learnings can be transferred to training programs that target children that attend primary school.

A robust, secure and efficient internet is in everyone’s interest. 
The internet is not only for human-operated computers; other 
electronic devices are also increasingly connected to the internet. 
This is called the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is is not

Wellington: Business continuity planning support for small businesses
When the Wellington Resilience Strategy was released in 2017, around 100 SMEs per annum participated in 
the existing Wellington Region Emergency Management Office (WREMO) business continuity programme. 
Wellington is now working with partners such as Chambers of Commerce to project aims to improve the 
programme’s reach with a view to 1,000 SMEs per annum participating.

Wellington  
Resilience Strategy

March 2017

Rather than focusing on a specific shock event, this programme helps Wellington’s business community to prepare for a wide 
range of possible disruptions, including major events such as cyber attacks and earthquakes, as well as smaller but potentially 
catastrophic events for small businesses, such as equipment failures. The benefits also go beyond preparedness – business 
continuity planning requires organisations to examine their business process, which can identify opportunities to make 
operational improvements that increase overall competitiveness and efficiency.

Given the fact that the Municipality has access to all vital databases in our 
city, civil servants have to be aware of the possible impact of a data breach 
on the daily life of our citizens.  A data breach affects people’s privacy and 
may even facilitate criminal activities like identity theft. 

To raise awareness on data security among civil servants, the Municipality 
of The Hague launched a game through which all staff test their knowledge 
and increase their awareness on digital security in a more immersive way. The 
game can be played together in person or remotely from multiple computers. 
The game was first played in 2017 and will be repeated in 2019. RTH will 
contribute to raise a wide audience in city hall to play this game and can also 
share experiences with other organisations that also want to use this game to 
raise awareness about data security..

3.7 Integrate resilience and 
climate adaptation into  
tender procedures

The decisions we make in projects now will have consequences for decades to 
come. Making climate adaptation part of every (re)development enables our built 
environment to become robust when faced with extreme weather.

WHY?
With expected population growth, The Hague is facing a housing 
and redevelopment challenge. By including sustainable measures in 
new developments we have the opportunity to reduce the impact 
of heat stress, drought, extreme rainfall and soil degradation, as 
well as promote biodiversity. By addressing multiple shocks and 
stresses at once we make the city more resilient.

As a first step, The Hague has signed the Climate Adaptive Building 
Covenant of the Province of South Holland in October 2018. This 
Covenant brings stakeholders together to create a framework 
that includes climate adaptation requirements in procurement 
procedures. This to ensure measures are taken in every (re)
development initiated by the city.

WHAT?
This initiative ensures that climate adaptation measures are always 
included in the city’s procurement procedures.

The Hague will be initiator in constructing, advocating and 
promoting the framework, bringing the relevant stakeholders 
together and facilitating knowledge and expertise sharing in order 
for the framework to benefit all stakeholders involved. We will 
draw on expertise and advice within The Hague, the Netherlands, 
and other cities in the 100RC Network.

3.8 Assessing climate  
interventions with most impact

Informed decision-making is increasingly challenging in a complex city system faced by 
climate change threats. By piloting a new tool to assess which climate adaptation solutions 
are most effective in different neighbourhoods, the City will be able to maximise the 
benefits of interventions.

The Climate Adaptation tool will be introduced for the public 
space development in Laakhavens. Lessons learned from these 
models can be used to develop a city-wide approach on climate 
change adaptation. Using this model in the city of The Hague will 
increase insights on environmental, social and financial impacts of 
climate adaptation measures, and will give more insight into the 
dependencies between the city’s systems.

WHY?
Our city is a complex system prone to the effects of extreme 
weather events which will worsen under climate change. 
When we develop major green-blue infrastructure to address 
challenges such as flooding, we need more insight into the 
interaction between problems and solutions at neighbourhood, 
street and building level.  With better information we can match 
interventions to the characteristics of the area, rather than 
applying a ‘one size fits all’ approach.
WHAT?
This initiative investigates which climate adaptation measures 
have most impact in different neighbourhoods. We propose to 
link existing models - like the 3Di model developed by the city to 
show the impact of heavy flooding-  with other resources, such as 
information on soil characteristics, so that we can develop more 
insight on each type of intervention. Models will be developed 
and tested in Erasmusveld and the Central Innovation District.

Paris: Transform schoolyards 
into cooling island “oases” 
Since adopting its Climate Change Adaptation 
Strategy, Paris has launched several initiatives 
aimed at adapting urban spaces to high 
temperatures. A centrepiece of their approach 
is a programme aimed at Paris’ schooyards, 
which cover more than 600,000m2. Already 
underway at some pilot locations, it will aim to 
gradually replace asphalt walkways with trees 
and vegetation, and/or test new materials (e.g. 
stabilised materials, recycled wood, kinetic 
tiles) and new methods to cool schoolyards and 
dormitories. The schoolyards will become places 
for learning and improved wellbeing.

In The Hague we have already embarked on 
efforts to green our schoolyards, but as we look to 
expand the programme we have a valuable ally and 
knowledge sharing partner in Paris.   

 

3.10 Increase the number  
of green roofs
The City of the Hague provides financial support for new green roofs.

Especially in a growing urban area such as The Hague, green roofs are an important tool for building climate-readiness. Green roofs 
help retain rainwater, save energy, improve amenity, regulate temperatures, and can increase the lifespan of roofs.

The Hague introduced a green roof subsidy in 2016. 77,000m² of green roofs have already been laid out in our city  – that equates 
to greening of around 0.7% of the number of flat roofs available. A total surface of  
11,243,705 m² of roof is still available (99.3%) for potential green roofs! The subsidy has recently been opened up to social housing 
cooperatives and a review into extending the subsidy is currently underway.

Lead: City of The Hague: DSO, DSB  

Partners: DDH

3.9 Developing cooler, greener  
schoolyards across the city

Too cool for school! Through subsidies to realise green schoolyards, the City of 
The Hague, Fonds 1818 and other partners are helping to create better learning 
environments while adapting our city to climate change.

The environments where children play can have a major influence on their behaviour. Evidence supports the view that 
children quarrel less, play more creatively and are generally safer in more natural spaces. Unfortunately, schoolyards are 
often paved areas that lack cooling capacity during summer.

In recent years, the City of The Hague has cooperated with Fonds 1818, Hoogheemraadschap Delfland and The Hague primary 
schools to bring green schoolyards to life. Using approaches such as de-paving and tree planting, green school yards increase 
cooling and water absorption, This adapts our neighbourhoods to climate change, while children can play in a more natural 
environment.

85 schools have applied for the start-up grant, leading to completion of 55 school squares (about 1/3 of all primary schools 
in The Hague!). New green school squares are still being delivered. The Water Board is taking the lead to further develop these 
spaces across our city.

STRONG AND  JUST CITYSTRONG AND  JUST CITY3.11 Training municipal  
enforcement officers to  
pre-empt criminal behaviour

Maintaining a safe city for our residents is a top priority. This initiative unlocks extra 
capacity by training municipal enforcement officers on a new methodology that helps 
them detect and react to  suspicious behaviour.
WHY?
As a city with an international reputation of peace and justice, 
The Hague is committed to offering a secure environment for 
its residents and visitors. Multiple public and private partners 
contribute to this goal by preventing or reacting to crime and 
other forms of malicious behaviour.

Behavioural profiling techniques can be used by the police but 
also by private security firms, public transport personnel and 
municipal enforcement officers. Training multiple sectors facilitates 
cooperation between various stakeholders.

One of the approaches to identify potentially criminal intentions is 
behavioural profiling. This is a methodology intended to help law 
enforcement officers to accurately detect abnormal behaviours 
and potential criminal subjects and take pre-emptive action.

In 2018 The Netherlands saw an example of how suspects can be 
identified through suspicious patterns of behaviour. A man who 
stabbed two American tourists in Amsterdam Central station was 
stopped by police just nine seconds after he launched his attack. 

One of the reasons for this quick intervention was that a few 
minutes after the suspect arrived at the train station his abnormal 
behaviour had come to the attention of a police officer trained 
to spot pickpockets and people potentially planning to undertake 
extremist acts.

WHAT?
In 2018, several teams from The Hague Police Unit undertook 
training on behavioural profiling. Co-financed by RTH, this programme 
will be expanded to include municipal enforcement officers.

and the world to tackle shared resilience 
challenges that transcend borders.

The big challenges facing The Hague do not stop at the 
city’s boundaries. As a city, we can take a leading role on 
issues like climate change and cyber security, but true 
resilience also means learning from others in different 
sectors and geographies. 

The Hague is part of the Randstad, one of Europe’s 
most important economic regions. With one of Europe’s 
major ports on our doorstep and two airports within 
close vicinity, a key reason for the region’s success 
is its connectivity and eagerness to collaborate. Our 
city already works extensively with partners – such 
universities and other knowledge institutes – to advance 
innovation and strengthen sustainable development. We 
regularly use cutting-edge science and data to inform 
our decision making, and we experiment with innovative 

funding models such as Health Impact Bonds to deliver 
improved outcomes more cost-effectively for our 
citizens. However, we can always do more and we can do 
it more intelligently.

The Hague has a close connection with Rotterdam – 
together with neighbouring municipalities, the two cities 
collaborate in the Metropolitan Region Rotterdam The 
Hague (MRDH). As fellow 100RC cities we have an 
opportunity to lead the way in regional collaboration for 
resilience. We hope to share these lessons with the 100 
Resilient Cities Network, as well as learn from the leading 
practices of other cities around the world.

This section proposes new cross-boundary collaborations which:

 ̆ Strengthen regional systems and critical infrastructure.
 ̆ Embed resilience thinking into our ways of working.
 ̆ Maximise opportunities from digitisation and build an inclusive job 

market.

municipality of The Hague 

Breaking siloes and improving collaboration between people in our city is core to 
a truly resilient The Hague. A resilience curriculum will be designed and delivered 
to support more people to practically apply and embed resilience thinking in their 
everyday work. 

WHY?
The Hague is home to many amazing examples of collaboration 
that improve quality of life for our citizens. But despite these 
best efforts, we can still be a city of silos where opportunities 
for integration are overlooked. A new way of thinking is 
necessary. One in which municipal and other leaders embed 
greater collaboration and integrated thinking into problem 
solving and project delivery.

WHAT?
Together with the City of Rotterdam we will develop a resilience 
training programme for managers. Covering both urban and 
personal resilience, the programme will result in managers who 
are better equipped to identify multiple opportunities in projects, 
can work more effectively across organisations, and can healthily 
withstand individual, day-to-day challenges that come with 
modern working life. 

We will seek input from other cities in the 100RC network that 
have successfully developed similar training programmes, such 
as Melbourne. Lessons from our initial training for managers 
will be used to develop future modules for project managers, 
trainees and others in the city.

We will also explore integrating the ‘resilience scan’ into our 
training. Developed by 100RC and Rotterdam, this process 
and tool is designed to help evaluate the resilience benefits of 
proposed and existing projects in a city. Projects are analysed 
by means of seven resilience qualities: flexibility, inclusiveness, 
integration, reflectiveness, redundancy, robustness and 
resourcefulness. The more qualities that can be found in the 
project, the more it may assist a city to withstand and bounce 
back from shocks and stresses. A pilot of the training has been 
developed.

on Investment policies on public 
procurement

By enhancing our Social Return on Investment policies on public procurement, we can 
boost the business climate for a specific category of social enterprises in our region, 
leading to sustainable participation of people with a distance to the job market.
WHY?
A job provides people with income and a social network: both 
important building blocks for resilience. However, getting 
and keeping a job is not for everyone. Some of our residents 
need intensive assistance and guidance, making them less 
employable in the regular job market.

30% of the workforce consists of people at a distance from the 
labor market. 

This improves the business environment for this specific category 
of social enterprises, resulting in a professional and sustainable 
integration of people into the labor market.

WHAT?
The municipality of The Hague prescribes contractors of larger 
projects to achieve a social return on investment. This means that 
the contractor uses 5% of the contracted budget to help people 
with a distance to the labor market. Contractors can meet this 
obligation by (1) providing these people with work themselves, 
(2) by purchasing products or services from a social employment 
programme, or by (3) offering activities or training that reduce the 
distance between this group and the labour market.

Building on this experience, The Hague wants to offer contractors 
a fourth opportunity to meet their SROI obligations. In addition to 
the three existing options, contractors can also choose to purchase 
goods or services from regional social enterprises, of which at least

4.3 Building a network of cyber 
resilient cities worldwide

Cities around the world increasingly face rapidly changing cyber threats. To 
facilitate an open dialogue of lessons learned and share expertise, The Hague will 
develop an exchange platform between cities in the 100RC Network on cyber 
resilience.

WHY?
Developing more sophisticated technology is not enough to 
be cyber resilient. As so many cities are facing cyber threats, 
exchanging expertise and knowledge is essential to keep up 
with new developments in this field. 

WHAT?
At the One Conference of the National Cyber Security Center in 
The Hague in 2018, The Hague, Atlanta and Greater Manchester 
exchanged experiences on digital resilience. It reinforced the 
urgent need to cooperate and learn from each other’s experiences. 

To facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience on cyber 
resilience, RTH has initiated an online cyber security group for 
cities in the 100RC network. This group will post news, have 
online and face to face meetings, and identify ways to effectively 
share network expertise beyond the 100RC cities.  The platform 
also serves as a hub for cyber security experts, so that they 
know who to approach in the event of a cyber incident.

This expertise will also feed into the G5 Smart City network in 
which The Hague has the lead for Safety and Security.

4.4 Identify and mitigate risks from  
interdependent critical services 

Source: SIM-CI

The Hague’s critical infrastructure is highly connected. Without the proper 
precautions, a disruption of one service can lead to failure in other services. By 
collaboratively identifying the interdependencies between critical infrastructure, 
stakeholders in our region will be able to take practical, evidence-based steps to 
improve the robustness and flexibility of critical service delivery.

WHY?
Our city’s critical infrastructure providers aim to maximise 
the reliability and quality of their services. Their reputation, 
and indeed the reputation of the Netherlands, is strong in this 
area; however, maintaining this reputation means continuing to 
invest and innovate.

More work is needed to understand possible ‘cascading 
effects’, which refers to when a disruption of one critical 
service leads to failures of other services that depend on it. As 
our city becomes more densely populated and complex, such 
events pose a larger risk. For example, building more high rises 
links water supply more closely to electricity supply, as the 
water needs to pumped to the upper floors. 

WHAT?
In the first phase we will deploy the CIrcle Tool developed by 
Deltares, which is a methodology that systematically identifies 
dependencies. Linking together stakeholders expertise and 
open data, the tool provides insight into the dependencies of 
a selection of The Hague’s critical infrastructure networks. A 
potential second step is to explore the possibilities to create a 
visualisation that shows dependencies and models cascading 
effects in a model. 

We will closely work with other cities and regions like Rotterdam 
and the region of the Waterboard Hollands Noorderkwartier, 
which have experience with using visualisations and simulation 
models. We will also connect with the EU DRIVER+ project, 
which tests tools for understanding cascading effects.

100RC NETWORK INSPIRATION
New Orleans: Building the resilience of interdependent systems 

Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans is one of the most well-known examples of a low-lying city facing devastating impacts 
from an extreme weather event. Shocks like hurricanes have cascading effects on the city’s critical infrastructure systems. 
When one system is compromised, it negatively impacts the function of other critical systems. For example, a power 
outage during a storm can affect energy-intensive pumping 
stations, resulting in severe street flooding.

The New Orleans Resilience Strategy provides a strong 
commitment to understanding and comprehensively managing 
these interdependencies. This includes major investment in 
comprehensive and innovative urban water management 
projects and new standards for resilient design. As a fellow 
low-lying city we stand to learn a great deal from New Orleans 
as we continue our journey in The Hague to understand and 
manage the risks posed by interdependent systems.

Sharing good practices by creating a guide to mitigate cyberattacks.

To actively prepare ourselves for what we need to do in the event of a cyber crisis, a cyberattack mitigation guide will be developed 
by the four largest Dutch cities (Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht). 

The guide will specify potential stakeholders to involve, their roles and instruments for intervention. The guide will not only increase 
resilience in the event of a crisis, but will also provide a picture of the critical networks in these cities and potential vulnerabilities.

Partners: MInisterie Justitie en Veiligheid

 

4.6 Coastar project

Water is life. This project explores alternative strategies for water 
management to increase the robustness and flexibility of our water supply.
A growing population and an increase in extreme weather events increasingly puts The Hague’s fresh water supply under pressure. As a 
coastal city, we also must be aware of the risks of salinisation. Innovative thinking is necessary to address these challenges.

Deltares is working with KWR and Arcadis to study the feasibility of large-scale underground storage of fresh water in the The Hague- 
Westland-Rotterdam region. Commissioned by the Province of South Holland and Dunea and other organisations, this research will build 
our knowledge on how to increase the fresh water buffer under our city and make our water system more robust against future shocks. 
There is also potential for using the thermal energy of the groundwater storage, although further investigation is needed.

Lead: Province of South Holland
Partners: KWR, Arcadis, Deltares, Dunea, City of The Hague: DSB

Relationships between our 
initiatives

Throughout this document we demonstrated the multiple 
benefits of initiatives by showing how they relate to 
various shocks and stresses, resilience opportunities, 
and the SDG’s. Based on the work of one of The 
Netherlands’ most famous artists, Piet Mondrian, 
this figure below shows how our initiatives 
will create benefits across the four 
dimensions of the City Resilience 
Framework (see page 11).

COLLABORATE IN THE REGION  AND BEYONDCOLLABORATE IN THE REGION  AND BEYONDMonitoring and evaluating the 
Resilience Strategy 

The Hague’s Resilience Strategy is the result of the invaluable investment of many people. Time, insight and inspiration have been 
generously provided through discussions, brainstorming sessions, workshops and research. The result is a plan for the city with 
concrete actions to be built upon over the coming years.

However, resilience is not a final goal, but a dynamic process that regularly requires adjustments.

In response to the ever-changing characteristics of city life, the City makes a strong commitment to monitor, assess and evaluate 
the core elements of the Resilience Strategy:

The journey to embed resilience
Evaluating the Resilience Strategy is not limited to individual initiatives. In 
collaboration with the Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and other stakeholders inside 
and outside the municipal organisation, RTH also aims to track: 

 ̆ Progress in encouraging new types of collaborations, both within and 

outside the Municipality.

 ̆ The awareness of the concept of resilience through events and the 

RTH website.

 ̆ The contribution of the initiatives to achieving the SDGs.

The initiatives
The RTH team will evaluate initiatives in this 
strategy using an approach called Realist 
Evaluation. Initially developed by Ray Pawson 
and Nick Tilley, the approach recognises that the 
relations between cause and effect can be hard 
to determine in an adaptive and complex system 
like a city. Therefore, realist evaluations aim to 
understand not only if an initiative makes an 
impact, but also how and in what circumstances 
it does so. A key strength of the approach is the 
ability to take the lessons learnt from a specific 
initiative (e.g. in a neighbourhood of The Hague) 
and explore if it could be applied in  different 
contexts, like other neighbourhoods and cities 
across the region and  the 100RC network.

Methods for data collection and analysis will vary 
for each initiative, drawing both on qualitative 
and quantitative sources. Where possible we will 
draw on sources like The Hague’s Urban Data 
Center, Dutch Statistics and the Leefbaarometer. 
210/5000 To facilitate the exchange of 
knowledge between The Hague and the 100RC 
network, standardised indicators and models 
(such as the City Resilience Framework and the 
SDGs) will be used where possible.

An active resilience 
movement 
The City of The Hague welcomes new ideas 
from everyone in our city and region. The RTH 
team is ready to work side-by-side with each 
and every one of you. This is a vital part of 
creating a resilience movement in The Hague. 
RTH will continue to engage with the city and 
its organisations, communities and institutions 
by implementing actions throughout the year; 
this will include events, workshops, speak at 
conferences, and training sessions on resilience. 
On an annual basis, RTH will organise a resilience 
day to share the monitoring and evaluation of the 
initiatives that are part of the strategy.
