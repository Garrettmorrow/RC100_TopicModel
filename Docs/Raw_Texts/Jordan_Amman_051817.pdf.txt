Amman Resilience Strategy 

Letter from the Chairman 
of Amman's Municipality 
Committee, Dr. Yousef 
Al- Shawarbeh

Since ancient times Amman has always been resilient with its people and 
has been able to deal successfully with all the situations and migration 
waves it witnessed. Today, Amman is a diverse city within the national unity 
framework, just as in its old history, the city of brotherly love: Philadelphia, its 
ancient name. As we join the 100 Resilient Cities network, we aim to deepen 
our knowledge of the international model tools used to deal with the shocks 
and stresses facing today's cities which are characterized by population 
growth and climate change, in order to build and enhance our city’s resilience 
in line with the directives of His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al-Hussein.

The city’s resilience is a basic requirement to create integrated societies, 
address the needs of their people and ensure their well-being. Therefore, 
we found that this initiative is pioneering in terms of bringing together 
individuals, companies, institutions, civil society organizations and 
international organizations to consider the problems and explore 
opportunities and initiatives. We used that as a basis to draft our first 
Resilience Strategy, which is different from previous strategies as it is 
inclusive and diverse, and joining 100RC network gave us access to learn 
from the best practices of other cities.

As we seek to put this strategy into practice, through implementation of 
its actions, I would like to thank the employees of GAM who worked on 
the drafting of this strategy. I would like also to thank 100 Resilient Cities 
network and the Rockefeller Foundation which supports this initiative, for 
helping us in developing our strategy, in collaboration with our strategic 
partner Arup and we look forward to more collaboration to build a better 
future for our city and its people.

Letter from the  
Chief Resilience Officer, 
Fawzi Masad

The city of Amman and other Jordanian cities are facing major challenges that 
hinder their development and growth. These challenges arecompounded by 
the instability in the region. Water scarcity, power cuts, high population growth 
rate and migration, economic problems and unemployment, climate change, 
inadequate infrastructure and public transportation, rising traffic congestion, 
and other environmental, social and cultural issues are some of these challenges. 
Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) however, has managed to address many 
of them and has increased its services provision proportionally with the sharp 
increase in the population, which has more than doubled over the past decade. 
This unprecedented urban growth and population increase have led to greater 
pressure on the resources of the Municipality, affecting its capability to develop 
and grow. Thus, following the traditional ways of working will not produce the 
desired results and will not achieve our vision of "having Amman a city that is 
an organized, modern, smart, safe, attractive, lively, friendly, viable, proud of its 
heritage and its roots". Therefore, it was essential for GAM to think of innovative 
ways to break away from the daily work and to move towards sound pre-
planning of the city’s future, to enable us to move from a reactive approach to 
proactive approach in the implementation of plans and initiatives according to 
the best international practices. Our actions today will shape our city’s future. 
GAM participation in 100 Resilient Cities network came following a call by 
the organization;that Amman, with all its components, whether individuals, 
communities, institutions or businesses; is capable of confronting, adapting and 
growing despite the tremendous shocks and permanent stresses it is subjected to. 
The comprehensive five pillar strategy aims to address all aspects of life 
and the needs of the city. It was developed with a wide participation by all 
stakeholders from both public and private sectors, local and international civil 
society organizations, youth, academia and others who met to discuss the 
city's future and draw a road map based on its potential. This strategy that we 
present to Ammanis, addresses transforming our challenges into opportunities 
to develop our city together and ensure the well-being of our people, children 
and future generations.
The strategy is a live document as the city is subject to periodic improvement 
and development in response to unexpected changes and future needs. We 
welcome any additional contributions from our partners that further promote 
the city’s resilience.
We would like to present our greatest gratitude to the former Mayor of Amman, 
Mr. Akel Biltaji, for his faith in the city's capabilities, his efforts to join the network 
and his continuous support during the development of the strategy. We also 
would like to thank Dr. Yousef Al-Shawarbeh, who supported this initiative in his 
capacity of former deputy mayor and current Chairman of Amman Committee. 
We also would like to thank all the employees of GAM for their active 
participation, as well as all honorable stakeholders whose contributions had a 
great impact on the success of our endeavor.
We would like also to thank the 100 Resilient Cities network for their support and 
for providing us with the opportunity to be part of those 100 other cities around 
the world in strengthening our capabilities and building the city's resilience, 
and finally to our strategic partners Arup for their sincere contributions to the 
development of the strategy.

Amman Resilience Strategy 

Letter from  
100RC President,  
Michael Berkowitz

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to 
congratulate the Greater Amman Municipality, Mayor Dr. Yousef 
Al-Shawarbeh , former Mayor Biltaji, and Chief Resilience Officer 
Fawzi Masad, on the release of  the city’s Resilience Strategy, a 
major milestone for the city and 100RC’s partnerships with it. 

The cultural, political, and commercial heart of Jordan, Amman 
has also grown into a formidable regional metropolis. This 
Strategy sets out a clear vision for the way forward, enabling the 
city to thrive rather than merely survive its various challenges. 
Resilient Amman addresses not only the city’s potential shocks, 
such as the refugee crisis, terrorism, and extreme weather, but 
also Amman’s stresses, such as inadequate public transportation, 
water scarcity, aging infrastructure, and high unemployment. 

This inspiring document does this by placing Amman’s 
citizens, especially its younger population, at its center, with 
initiatives that create opportunity and allow for the city’s 
natural talent to develop. With this as a foundation, we are 
confident that Amman can build a strong, resilient future.

The leadership and commitment of former Mayor Biltaji, and Engineer 
Fawzi Masad, Amman’s Chief Resilience Officer, have guided the city to 
this major moment. This Strategy represents the beginning of the exciting 
work to come in the months and years ahead, including projects with 
100RC Platform Partner, the International Rescue Committee. And 100 
Resilient Cities’ partnership with the city is also just beginning. Now we 
can collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives contained 
in the following pages, which will positively impact the lives of all who 
call Amman home. From its early work and active engagement with 
the network, Amman is well positioned to help us in leading the global 
urban resilience revolution, especially by becoming a regional resilience 
champion and paving the way for other cities in the Middle East. 

We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to 
be a partner in these efforts and look forward, together 
with Amman, to create a new global standard.

About this Strategy

This strategy sets out the vision for a resilient Amman and the 
pillars, goals and actions that will help us achieve it.

During Phase I of the strategy development process, we aimed to understand 
the present resilience status of the city, through assessments of our shocks, 
stresses, and potential scenarios affecting our city assets, and most 
importantly through engagement with the city’s stakeholders, including 
Greater Amman Municipality departments, private-sector, NGOs, universities, 
youth organizations and more. At the end of Phase I, we identified discovery 
areas or themes that we need to address to build the city’s resilience.

In Phase II, we delved more deeply into the discovery areas and undertook 
a number of diagnostic activities to understand the resilience challenges, 
which resulted in identification of a number of opportunities, specific 
priorities and initiatives which will help us improve the resilience of the 
city. We prioritized these opportunities using the Resilience Lens tool, and 
with close collaboration with our stakeholders. From this we produced a 
shortlist of opportunities that have resilience value and implementation 
potential. This strategy includes the actions identified in this process.

IntroductionAmman Resilience Strategy 

Amman's  
Resilience Journey

Phase I                               

of our approach is all about 
understanding the resilience 
issues facing Amman. At the end 
of this process, we produced an 
initial assessment of its resilience – 
known as the Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment (PRA), and identified 
Discovery Areas, which are thematic 
areas around which deeper analysis 
and broader engagement was 
undertaken in the next phase. 

Agenda setting workshop

January 2016 at Amman’s Al-
Hussein Cultural Center

The Agenda Setting 
Workshop was the first step 
towards the development 
of Amman’s Resilience 
Strategy. The workshop 
brought together diverse 
stakeholders to introduce 
them to the 100RC initiative, 
familiarize them with resilience 
concepts, and identify 
Amman’s critical resilience 
challenges. It was attended 
by around 100 people.

Appointment of City 
Resilience Officer 
(CRO) and Amman 
Resilience Team

January 2016 

Eng. Fawzi Masad was 
appointed as CRO and the 
Office of Resilience was 
established. The Resilience 
Team was initiated to 
support the CRO in 
developing Amman’s 
city resilience strategy.

Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment (PRA) 
and identification of 
Discovery Areas 

August 2016

The PRA was released in 
August 2016.  This summarises 
all the activities carried out in 
Phase I. From it, five Discovery 
Areas were identified:

1.  Efficient institutional 

financial planning

2.  Comprehensive urban 

development

3.  Effective legislation

4.  Resourceful environment

5.  Robust community

A final cross-cutting Discovery 
Area was also identified:

6. 

Improve Amman's ability 
to cope with sudden 
increase of population

Amman Resilience Strategy Diagnostic work 

October/November 2016

•  Diagnostic activities helped 

us to understand how the 
city is currently performing, 
to identify potential risks 
and vulnerabilities, gaps in 
knowledge, and opportunities 
for collaboration and strategic 
action that could bring broader 
social, economic, cultural and 
environmental benefits. 

•  Diagnostic activities were 

carried out to develop more 
detailed research and analysis 
of our selected Discovery 
Areas, in order to improve 
our understanding of the 
issues and uncover potential 
opportunities and actions that 
could be addressed through 
the Resilience Strategy. 
More than 60 opportunities 
were produced either 
through Working groups 
discussions, research, analysis, 
comparative analysis with 
other cities, or extension of 
an existing program/action/
initiative already underway.

Introduction

Field of Opportunity 
and Resilience Lens

December  2016

Bringing together the findings of 
the discovery area analysis and 
diagnostic work, we used the 
Resilience Lens tool to collate a 
list of practical, viable, resilience 
building opportunities that we 
could realistically implement 
over the short and longer term. 
The tool helped us assess 
the resilience contribution of 
the opportunities and their 
practical viability in the real 
context of the city to create 
the Field of Opportunity.

During the Field of Opportunity 
(FoO) workshop, we prioritized 
the opportunities with the 
Steering Committee to identify 
a set of resilience-building, 
implementable initiatives to take 
forward in the final strategy, 
and identify our resilience 
goals.  Five pillars and 16 goals 
were identified for Amman. 

PHASE II

17
17

Development of City 
Resilience Strategy

January – May 2017

From this we started to develop 
the pillars, goals and actions that 
form the basis of the resilience 
strategy. The pillars are: 

•  An integrated and smart city 

•  An environmentally 

proactive city

•  An innovative and 

prosperous city

•  A young and equal city

•  A united and proud city

Phase II                             
focuses on a combination of technical 
assessment and strategic stakeholder 
alignment and engagement. 
This information underpins the 
development of the final city 
resilience strategy. During this phase, 
the city develops its Discovery 
Areas into opportunities, taking 
into consideration learnings from 
Phase I and the PRA. This results in 
specific priorities and initiatives for 
implementation in the city’s resilience 
strategy. The strategy outlines 
the key resilience challenges and 
opportunities the CRO and city are 
committed to addressing, and the 
activities the city and its partners will 
implement to strengthen its resilience.

IntroductionCity resilience  

What is city resilience? 

City resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, 
businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter 
what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience. 

Amman has adopted the use of the City Resilience Framework to help assess 
our state of resiliente. 100RC framework – developed by Arup and The 
Rockefeller Foundation - called the City Resilience Framework (CRF) helps 
cities to identify their resilience strengths, weaknesses and opportunities. 
Cities are complex systems comprising multiple overlapping systems. 
The CRF acts as a lens to understand this complexity and the drivers that 
contribute to city resilience. The framework is made up of 4 main dimensions 
and 12 drivers that together illustrate what makes a resilient city.

Amman Resilience Strategy Shocks and stresses 

A city’s ability to remain competitive whilst supporting the wellbeing 
of its citizens may be influenced by sudden shocks and ongoing 
stresses. A shock is a sudden, acute event that occurs infrequently, 
such as a major flood or terrorist attack. A stress is a chronic condition 
that gradually weakens the city’s fabric on a daily or cyclic basis, such 
as high rates of unemployment and severe traffic congestion.

Qualities

A resilient city also exhibits seven qualities, which should 
be evident in the way the city – or any system, function 
or asset within the city – operates. These are:

Robust 

comprising well-conceived, constructed 
and managed systems, capable of 
withstanding sudden shocks.

Redundant 

purposefully incorporating spare 
capacity to accommodate disruption 
due to extreme pressures, surges in 
demand or an external event.

Flexible 

willing and able to adopt alternative 
strategies in response to changing 
circumstances or sudden crises.

Reflective 

able to learn from past experiences 
to inform future decisions.

Resourceful 

able to recognize alternative ways 
to use resources at times of crisis, in 
order to meet needs or achieve goals.

Inclusive 

able to create a shared sense of 
ownership in decision making 
throughout the city, incorporating 
the knowledge and perspectives of 
all majority and minority groups.

Integrated 

able to coordinate work across 
institutions and systems to catalyse 
additional benefits.

IntroductionAbout 100RC

100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation (100RC), is dedicated to helping cities 
around the world become more resilient to the 
physical, social, and economic challenges that are a 
growing part of the 21st century. 100RC supports the 
adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience 
that includes not just the shocks – earthquakes, fires, 
floods, etc. – but also the stresses that weaken the 
fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis. By 
addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city 
becomes more able to respond to adverse events, 
and is overall better able to deliver basic functions 
in both good times and bad, to all populations.

Amman and 100RC

In December 2014, Amman was selected to join the 
second cohort of the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC). As 
a member of the 100RC Network, Amman receives 
technical support and resources from 100RC to 
develop and implement a City Resilience Strategy, 
including hiring and engaging a Chief Resilience 
Officer (CRO) to work in the city government 
on resilience initiatives. In January 2016, Mayor 
of Amman, Mr. Akel Biltaji, appointed engineer 
Fawzi Masad as CRO, a new position created 
to lead city-wide resilience building efforts.

The importance of being in this network 
is for Amman to share and exchange 
learnings from other cities globally.

Amman Resilience Strategy Amman is one of the Middle East’s thriving 
metropolises. It is the political, cultural, and commercial 
center of Jordan and a successful regional economic 
powerhouse. Amman is home to around 4 million 
residents, more than 42% of Jordan’s total population. 

Despite its turbulent history, Amman has grown to be 
a regional hub in the Middle East, providing a strong 
example of tolerance, progress, and peacefulness. 
Amman – whose ancient name, Philadelphia, means 
the ‘city of brotherly love’ - has shown resilience 
throughout the ages, welcoming Circassian people in 
the 19th century, Palestinians in the 20th, and Iraqis 
and Syrians in the 21st century. In Amman, we see 
the resilience building process as the continuation of 
an age old tradition rather than a new approach.

Amman and Resilience Modern day Amman

1870-1900

Encouraged by the Ottoman 
Empire, Muslims escaping 
religious prosecution from Russia 
– Circassians - settled at the 
ancient site of Amman, forming 
the nucleus of the modern city. 

1921-1948

Amman became the capital of 
Transjordan in 1921. The city grew 
rapidly from a first recorded 
area of 2km2 in 1925, to around 
19km2 in the 1940s. By this 
time, Amman had an estimated 
population of more than 33,000. 

1900-1921

The city expanded due to the 
construction of the Ottoman 
Hejaz railroad in 1905 and the 
foundation of the Hashemite 
Emirate of Transjordan in 1921.

1948-1967

Expansion spread across the 
slopes of the mountains to 
accommodate large numbers of 
Palestinian refugees fleeing the 
Palestinian conflict in 1948. By 
1967, the city’s population swelled 
to over 500,000 people, spread 
over an area of around 42km2. 

Economy 

Amman is divided administratively into 22 districts, 
each with a high level of autonomy to deliver 
city services. The municipality controls all of its 
services, except for zoning, planning, infrastructure, 
design and construction, which are carried out 
centrally in the Municipality main offices . 

Despite these challenges, Amman is the fourth most 
visited city in the region, with more than a million 
tourists arriving each year and associated revenues 
in excess of one billion USD. Amman is also a popular 
destination for medical tourism, which contributes 
over one billion USD to the economy annually.

Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) is financially 
independent, with a large percentage of its 
revenues self-generated through service 
taxes, fees and investment projects. The 
remainder comes from part loans. 

Amman has a strong banking industry. However, 
in recent years, Amman’s economy has suffered 
the knock-on effects of the global financial 
crisis and regional conflicts. Tourism has 
also dropped and unemployment has risen; 
economic growth is at a six-year low of 2.5%. 

Unemployment in Amman is high – currently around 
15% - especially amongst women and young people. 
The Syrian crisis is not helping. Despite not being 
legally allowed to work until recently, non-Jordanian 
migrants have long competed for low-paid casual 
work in the informal sector, which accounts for 
more than 40% of all national employment. Recent 
legislative changes mean that Syrian refugees will 
now receive identity cards, helping them to access 
the formal job market. This is expected to have an 
impact on employment rates and the overall economy. 

28

Amman Resilience Strategy 1967-1992

Urban sprawl brought 
neighbouring villages into the 
city of Amman. Palestinian 
refugees continued to settle 
in the city. By the late 1980s, 
Amman’s population rose to 
around 1.5 million, with an 
area of around 530km2. 

2007-2009

An urban master plan was 
developed to regulate 
urban sprawl. The 
accession of several new 
districts led the population 
to increase to over 2.8 
million, over a land area 
of nearly 2000km2. 

1992-2007

The city continued to 
expand, growing to 2.5 
million over 680km2 
by the mid-2000s. 

2009-2016

A re-evaluation of the Amman 
Master Plan has led the city to 
reconsider merging the new 
districts to Amman, the City now 
spread on area of approximately 
800km2. In recent years, 
successive conflicts in Iraq and 
Syria have brought new waves 
of refugees to the city, driving its 
population to more than 4 million. 
Non-Jordanians represent around 
one third of Jordan’s population. 

Climate 

Amman has a varied topography and diverse 
climate. Extreme micro-climates mean that snow is 
not uncommon in the western and northern parts 
of the city, whilst at the same time rain is frequent 
in the center and east, and high temperatures are a 
challenge in the south-eastern parts of the city. 

Migration 

Amman has a long history of tolerance towards 
refugees and migrants, having accommodated 
new populations following the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict in 1948, the Arab-Israeli War in 1967, 
the Gulf Wars in the 1990s and early 2003, the 
recent Iraq war, and ongoing Syrian conflict. 

Jordan’s population increased by nearly 87% 
in the last decade, reaching 9.5 million in 2015. 

The majority of this growth came from non-
Jordanians, who represent around one third of 
the Kingdom’s population (2.9 million), of whom 
658.000 are registered Syrian refugees. 

The sharp rise in the city’s population has placed a 
huge strain on the city’s resources and infrastructure, 
including water, education, unemployment, 
transportation, housing, and medical services. This has 
contributed to an 83% increase in public debt, a 30% 
increase in youth unemployment, a 40% increase in 
demand for water, and a 17% increase in rental costs. 

Despite these pressures, in Amman we are 
proud of our diverse identity, which we see as 
a strength. Diversity and tolerance are vital to 
our past, our present, and our future. They are 
also at the heart of our resilience strategy. 

29

Amman and Resilience Amman’s resilience 
challenges 

As a city that has grown rapidly and adapted to accommodate large migrant populations 
throughout its history, we are already familiar with the concept of resilience. But as other pressures 
such as climate change, lack of economic diversity, and resource constraints increase, we are now 
facing new challenges for which we must prepare. 

The following table shows the infrequent shocks and ongoing stresses that affect Amman identified by our stakeholders 
in the working groups.

ACUTE SHOCKS

•  Economic crisis
•  Terrorism
•  Major infrastructure failure
•  Drought
•  Heatwaves
•  Flash / surface flood

CHRONIC STRESSES

•  High energy costs
•  Water shortage
•  Lack of natural resources
•  Limited access to financial assistance
•  Major influx of refugees and/or asylum seekers
•  Changing demographics
•  Low quality services especially in health and education
•  Urbanization
•  Unemployment
•  Lack of affordable housing
•  Lack of diverse livelihood opportunities
•  Traffic congestion/ lack of public transport system

Amman Resilience Strategy Climate-related 
challenges

Unusually heavy rains often lead to 
flooding in lower-lying areas of the city, 
and its elevation exposes it to hazardous 
blizzards. Recent snowstorms have 
paralyzed the city, affecting schools, 
transportation and the power grid. The 
city has responded to these disruptions 
by establishing protocols for emergency 
operations, including rapid-response 
communications centers and elaborate 
community coordination processes.

Recent influx  
of migrants

has put pressure on the city’s 
infrastructure and its ability to deliver 
basic services, this includes our waste 
management and transport systems. 
While the city has well-managed road, 
tunnel, and bridge infrastructure, 
there is little in the way of reliable 
public transport infrastructure, forcing 
residents to rely heavily on cars. 

Lack of natural 
resources

including energy and water, also render 
the city heavily reliant on imports 
from the wider region. This leaves the 
city exposed to price volatility and 
insecurity of supply. Compounded by 
increasing demand from a growing 
population, Amman must find ways to 
meet its future resource needs without 
compromising its ability to deliver 
reliable and high quality services. 

Economic challenges 

Regional instability and a 
difficult business and investment 
environment that discourages foreign 
investments have also contributed 
to economic stagnation and a 
growing threat to the continuity of 
the city’s services and systems.

Amman’s Pillars, Goals and ActionsGoal A: 
Improve the  
Mobility Systems

Inadequate Mobility and Transportation 
system form a major environmental, 
economic and social challenge for 
Amman. The decline in attractiveness of 
public transport as a travel option led 
people to depend more and more on 
private car ownership causing chronic 
congestions and expand demand 
on parking. This is not a sustainable 
solution and money and time consuming 
especially for the underprivileged 
population.
Greater Amman Municipality has 
developed a Transportation and 
Mobility Master Plan (TMMP) based on 
information and surveys conducted 
more than ten years ago. However; this 
plan was not implemented for various 
reasons excluding part of the first stage 
of the Bus Rapid Transit system.Due to 
extensive increase in population during 
the last decade and the expansion of 
urban areas; it is essential to update 
the TMMP taking into account these 
major changes. We need a more 
efficient smart mass transport network/
systems. This should include demand 
management measures, making the road 
network more modern, more responsive 
and thus more efficient. This work will 
be underpinned by the latest research 
carried out in relation to transport and 
congestion.

transport

•  Land transport 

Regulatory 
Commission

Developing an integrated mobility plan is 
one of the city's top priorities aiming at 
addressing traffic congestion, the increase 
in private car use, lack of mass transport 
and safe pedestrian infrastructure. We will 
use demand management mechanisms 
and smart data to inform and operate 
the mobility plan. This will help us set 
up pilot projects in the medium term. 
As part of the sustainable transport 
strategy, a series of key performance 
indicators (KPIs) will be developed and 
used to measure its success. This will 
enable the plan to evolve and to be 
focused or reshaped as appropriate. 

Smart applications including e-payments 
and real time communication and tracking 
systems will be introduced and provide 
fair opportunities and a competitive 
environment for all taxi operators. This 
will be supported by clear legislation 
that protects the rights of all parties. 
It will also encourage partnership 
between the public and private sectors.

Resilience Value
•  Decrease traffic congestion, and 

provide a safe environment for 
pedestrians and drivers alike. 

•  Integrate land-use and 

transportation planning to deliver 
public transport infrastructure.

•  Produce behavior change in citizens 
travel mode in favor of more walking 
and more public transport use.

•  Contribute to the emissions reduction 

and improve the city's air quality.

Consider the mobility challenges and opportunities from residential 
neighborhoods in Amman (particularly the most marginalized and 
isolated among them) and critical places of employment (i.e. zones 
such as Sahab Industrial City, King Hussein Business Park, and Queen 
Alia International Airport free zone) or service provision centers.

Partners 
Ministry of 
transport

We will deliver a premium quality, 
economically feasible, car-competitive 
mass transit system for use by all of 
Amman's citizens including car owners. 
Amman's BRT will be the city’s first 
bus rapid transit system, in which high-
capacity buses run in exclusive and 
segregated road lanes. Buses will run 
as frequently as every 3 minutes along 
Amman’s busiest corridors. There will 
be 3 routes; from Sweileh in North West 
Amman to sport city intersection, and 
from sport city intersection to Jordan 
Museum in Ras-Al-AIn in east Amman, 
and from Al-Mahatta through Yarmouk 
street towards East South Amman 
limited to infrastructure enhancement 
along this route. The system will be 
expanded over time to cover all of 
Amman's neighborhoods. This action 
includes the development and design 
of BRT stops, stations, passenger 
information, vehicle specifications, 
interchanges and bus terminals. The BRT 
system currently under construction 
aims is increase the use of public 
transport from 13% to 20% by 2019.

Resilience Value
•  Provide a safe and modern 
public transport system to 
reduce reliance on the car, 
and encourage alternative 
modes of transport.

•  Enhance accessibility for 

citizens to goods and 
services, in particular 
through the provision of a 
comprehensive and affordable 
public transport system.
•  Reduce emissions from 

transport (cars) and improve 
air quality and public health.  

•  Contribute to Amman’s 
aspirations of efficiency, 
inclusivity and sustainability.

Inspiration from Bangkok
Integrated Mass 
Transport System 
Master Plan

Bangkok will develop a master plan for an integrated transport 
system, including the Mass Transit Master Plan, feeder system 
and other modes of public transportation such as bus and 
water transport to ensure connectivity across the city.

To maximize the use of an integrated and robust public transportation 
system in Bangkok, the Master Plan and budget for system operation 
will be prepared based on detailed studies, review and analysis 
of relevant research on secondary public transportation systems, 
physical volumes of traffic data and mobility information, forecasting 
public transit use and passengers, and assessing the efficiency of 
secondary public transportation in reducing road congestion.

44

Amman Resilience Strategy Action 1.A.3 
Plan and construct a Metro System in the main corridors 

Design, build and operate a light rail 
public transport system, operating at 
a high capacity in the main corridors in 
Amman. The routes and locations of this 
network will be integrated within the 
strategic master plan of Amman and in 
cooperation will all related stakeholders.  
The first phase of the action will be to 
undertake a feasibility study, followed 
by a pilot project that will include a light 
rail route linking the busiest link between 
south and North-east Amman, including; 
infrastructure stations, terminals, vehicle 
specification and operating system.

discrimination or violence while riding public transportation.

45

Amman’s Pillars, Goals and ActionsGoal B: 
Promote walkability 

One of the major issues in Amman is 
the dominance of cars in the streets 
causing increased traffic congestion and 
air pollution. Our hilly urban landscape 
has an abundance of pedestrian friendly 
streets and alleyways, but walking 
culture is almost non-existent. This is 
due to the lack of basic infrastructure 
such as safe sidewalks and pedestrian 
crossings. Cities around the world are 
moving towards promoting walking 
as one of the major sustainable 
and active modes of transport as a 
response to environmental and health 
challenges, and to reduce congestion, 
GHG emissions, and healthcare costs 
for both people and governments. We 
want to take advantage of our weather 
to promote walking for all, especially 
the most vulnerable in society.  This will 
link with our cultural assets, adventure 
tourism, and the digital economy for 
the youth. We will find the right balance 
between pedestrians and vehicles.

46

Amman Resilience Strategy Action 1.B.1
Develop, review and update Amman's 'Street Manual' 

As transport infrastructure is evolving, 
and cities becoming multimodal, 
including pedestrians and cyclists, it 
is important to review and produce 
a streets manual that reflects urban 
settings. This, in design terms within 
cities, moves away from intercity 
geometric standards for network 
layouts. We will review and update our 
Street Manual to provide guidance for 
practitioners involved in the planning, 
design, provision and approval of 
new streets, including modifications 
to existing ones. This action aims to 
increase the quality of streets through 
good design, creating more people-
oriented streets and providing a safe 
urban environment for all citizens 
including the most vulnerable. 

Action 1.B.2 
Create a walking map 

We will start by identifying a number 
of possible routes in the city to 
create a network that connects our 
neighborhoods. We will integrate our 
existing assets such as Rainbow street, 
the old downtown, the Citadel, the 
Roman Theatre, art galleries and others 
with the identified network to create 
an inclusive walking map for the City 
aimed at all ages of the population 
and tourists alike. We will provide 
the required walking infrastructure 
based on our revised 'Street Manual'. 
We will create a walkability app and 
public campaigns to promote walking 
as an active mode of transport.

Amman’s Pillars, Goals and ActionsAction 1.B.3 
Explore tactical urbanism opportunities

Tactical urbanism, a term that has become 
common and popular in 2010-2012, is used 
to describe temporary, pop-up, small-
scale, low-cost place-making interventions 
to the built environment that improve 
the livability of our cities and inspire 
long-term change.  Tactical urbanism 
interventions can be applied to streets, 
alleyways, parking spaces, and parking 
lots. Amman will work with the youth, 
communities and NGOs to temporarily 
reclaim space dedicated to vehicles to 
increase the vitality of our street life, 
create safe places for people to be active 
and social. We want to create meaningful 
temporary public realm spaces. We also 
aim to engage and learn from other 100RC 
cities who have implemented similar 
interventions. We want to empower 
citizens and make our streets lively again.

•  Help temporarily reclaim 
spaces designated to cars

•  Introduce more green spaces 

to urban environment.

Explore opportunities to use tactical urbanism to promote dialogue 
and interaction among diverse community groups, particularly among 
the youth. Events such as “pop-up football matches” or other similar 
events may work to promote social cohesion. Further, allowing diverse 
youth groups to explore opportunities for tactical urbanism themselves 
(for example, allowing youth groups to organize an activity within 
a municipally owned public space or activities to connect refugee 
youth with others in more established neighborhoods) may encourage 
positive creativity and serve as a way of promoting urban citizenship.

48

Amman Resilience Strategy Action 1.B.4
Organize a design competition for Amman's Hijazi railway

The Hijazi Railway extends from the most 
northerly part of Jordan to the south. It 
was built by the Ottomans around 100 
years ago, with the aim of connecting 
Istanbul and Mecca. It is now one of 
Jordan's most highly valued assets. It 
has also contributed to raising property 
prices along the route. Today, the Railway 
Corporation organizes weekly tourist 
and family oriented trips along a 10 km 
section of track using a steam engine 
and restored wagons. We believe this 
asset could make a more interesting 
and effective contribution to the city 
and its citizens. Using the New York 
City Highline project as a case study, we 
will organize a design competition to 
revitalize the railway as a major historical 
asset that connects the city, and as a 
means to engage communities in more 
active, green and open spaces in the 
city. The railway has the potential to 
serve as a social/meeting hub, a cycling 
and walking route, an entertainment 
venue, and a green public space.

Inspiration from 
other cities
New York Highline

The New York City High Line is a 2.33 km linear park 
built in Manhattan on an elevated section of a disused 
Central Railroad spur called the West Side Line. 
Inspired by the 4.8 km Promenade Plantée (tree-lined 
walkway) in Paris, the High Line has been designed 
as an aerial greenway and ‘rails-to-trails’ park. 

The High Line is a highly innovative public 
space, offering visitors an outdoor experience 
unlike anything else in New York. The setting 
provides the perfect conditions for successful 
public-facing events, with visitor numbers 
reaching 60,000+ on the park's busiest days. 

An integrated water drainage and retention system 
helps to reduce stormwater run-off while greenery 
provides shading and cooling, helping to lower 
the urban heat island effect. The park has also 
contributed to significant urban development 
and increased land values along the route. 

49

Amman’s Pillars, Goals and ActionsGoal C: 
Institutionalize planning 
in the city

Amman has grown from a city of 
29Km2 in 1961 to a metropolis of 
800Km2 to date with an urban area 
of 630Km2. This growth is a result 
of a number of factors including 
rural urban migration, concentration 
of economic activity and services 
in the capital but most importantly 
the influx of refugees from the 
surrounding countries especially 
in the last few years following the 
conflict in Syria which are putting 
pressure on the city's infrastructure.  
Amman's quality of life is threatened 
by the increase in traffic congestion, 
air pollution, reduced pedestrian 
accessibility, dominance of vehicular 
roads, lack of open public spaces, 
all compounded by the lack of 
strict urban planning. We aim to 
institutionalize urban planning in 
the city to allow for a sustainable 
growth for the future.  

50

Amman Resilience Strategy Action 1.C.1
Finalize and implement Amman Strategic Master Plan 2060

We will develop a comprehensive 
Strategic Master plan for the city that 
guides development and enhances 
the quality and character of the built 
environment. The plan will encourage 
compact urban growth to make the 
best use of existing services, promote

Learning from other cities
Copenhagen Climate Adaption Plan

The city of Copenhagen developed its Climate Adaption Plan in response 
to evidence that the city faces significant risks from extreme water-related 
hazards including torrential rain and flooding from the sea. 

The plan adopts a flexible approach to climate adaptation which can be developed and 
adapted gradually over several years. It includes strategies and programs to minimize the 
risks of future climate change as well as to improve Copenhageners’ quality of life. 

It focusses on three levels of adaptation: 1) reducing the likelihood of an event happening, 2) 
reducing the scale of the event, and 3) reducing the city's vulnerability to an event. Examples 
of adaptation measures include: disconnection of storm water from the sewer by separation or 
SUDS, establishing dikes, raising building elevation, building green structures such as floodable 
parks and green spaces, and monitoring the impact of the changing climate on public health.

Waste management was identified as 
an important strategic goal for Amman. 
Relevant stakeholders were invited to 
feed in to a focused workshop to examine 
the city’s current waste management 
procedures and explore how to improve 
and enhance the system’s future resilience. 

The workshop was conducted over three 
days, starting with an optional site visit 
to three waste management sites. The 
main workshop was held over two days 
at the King Hussein Cultural Centre in 
Amman, with 80 people in attendance.

The workshop was designed to:

•  Increase participants’ knowledge of the 
current waste situation in Amman (e.g. 
the major sources of waste, collection and 
treatment arrangements and facilities, and 
markets for recyclable materials)

•  Identify relevant waste stakeholders in 

the city (e.g. from the Municipality, private 
enterprise and NGO sector) and consider 
their potential roles in working together to 
deliver a more resilient service 

•  Understand the waste system’s 

interdependency with other city systems 
and identify potential synergies (e.g. with 
energy, industry, agriculture)

•  Identify city-wide opportunities and 

actions that the city (and stakeholders) 
should take to develop a more resilient 
waste management system

Workshop output 
showing opportunities 
in three categories

Participants recognized the role of the landfill 
site in managing the city’s waste, but also 
identified opportunities for diversifying the 
waste management in Amman in response 
to the city’s shocks and stresses.

Opportunities developed during the workshop 
fell into three distinct categories: 

•  Strengthening legislation;

•  Developing infrastructure; and 

•  Improving awareness, education and 

consultation regarding waste management. 

Potential actions agreed across these categories 
included: increasing source segregation of 
waste, increasing treatment of organic waste, 
and increasing the use of energy-from-waste.

The level of participation at the workshop 
suggests there is a strong will amongst 
organizations in Amman to improve how waste 
is managed. Findings from this workshop led to 
the conclusion that Greater Amman Municipality 
would benefit from improvements to waste 
management (see Actions under 2.E). This will set

An Innovative 
and  
Prosperous City

We will...

A.

Leverage our existing human 
capital to create employment

B. Support entrepreneurs, 
start-ups and incubators

C. Empower women 

79

Amman’s Pillars, Goals and ActionsGoal A: 
Leverage Our Existing 
Human Capital to 
Create Employment 

Our human capital is a key source 
of competitive advantage in Jordan. 
Jordan is one of the best educated 
countries in the Arab world with a 
literacy rate at 93.3% distributed 
equally amongst men and women. 
With a 15% total unemployment rate, 
of which 29% is amongst our youth, 
we need to limit brain drain and have 
a greater emphasis on knowledge-
based economy to provide better 
employment opportunities for highly 
educated citizens including the youth 
and migrants. 

80

Amman Resilience Strategy Action 3.A.1 
Work with the education institutions to match education to future skills 
requirements and reduce child labor 

We will work with local education 
institutions to undertake surveys and 
gather data to better understand the 
skills that will be needed in the future. 
Collaboratively, we will explore the 
opportunity to set up job centers, 
career advice service, design training 
programs, and awareness campaigns to 
ensure students acquire the right skills 
needed in the labor market. We will also 
work with the Ministry of Education 
to implement awareness raising 
campaigns and training programs 
for inspectors against child labor.

Inspiration from Pittsburg
Providing 21st century 
education for youth

Under the “People” pillar, the city sets the goal to eliminate 
barriers to opportunity for education and employment 
for all residents. Among the actions for implementation, 
the city plans to scale current pilot and small-scale efforts 
to integrate 21st century job skill training into formal 
school programming, for example Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) initiatives. 

This will allow Pittsburgh’s children to receive training and 
build skills necessary to pursue 21st century jobs in engineering, 
computer science, advanced manufacturing, and more – 
sectors that characterize Pittsburgh’s key growth industries.

Amman’s Pillars, Goals and ActionsAmman Resilience Strategy 

Working with our partners

International Rescue 
Committee (IRC) 
recommendations on the 
refugee crisis

Jordan is host to one of the biggest refugee 
populations in the world. The Syrian influx 
brings the estimate of total unregistered 
migrants (not just Syrians) to over 1.4 million. 

The city of Amman has been a primary 
destination for Syrian refugees. At the start of 
the crisis (2011-2012), UNHCR estimated that 
around 20% of urban refugees settled in Amman 
and, three years later, that share has risen to 
more than 34%. While no exact figures exist, 
UNHCR estimates that over 181,000 persons of 
concern reside within the Amman Governorate, 
though the actual number is certainly higher.

The IRC, in partnership with 100RC, carried out 
in-depth research to understand the scale of the 
problem and make practical recommendations 
that would align with Amman’s goals and 
actions in the resilience strategy. Interviews, 
site visits and workshops formed the basis of 
the process. Based on their findings the IRC 
made the following recommendations:

Amman Resilience Strategy Amman’s Pillars, Goals and Actions

1 Promote an inclusive approach to 

resilience. The strategy should extend the 
benefits of its resilience goals to all residents 
of Amman with an added emphasis on the 
sudden increase of population, including 
marginalized and displaced residents. 
We have added 'an inclusive city' as 
a cross-cutting resilience theme; and 
adapted actions that address the specific 
needs of displaced residents and host 
communities. In addition, we recommend 
including the development of an Inclusive 
Resilience Plan; and pursuing opportunities 
to include refugee and displaced 
populations in everyday city activities 
through community engagement in urban 
development plans or environmental 
awareness campaigns and activities.

2 Develop an Inclusive Resilience Plan. 

This may include actions such as: issuing 
an Amman Citizen Card to facilitate 
access to various service centers from 
both National, Municipal, and Civil Society 
actors while linking with the “I Love 
Amman” youth initiative and promoting 
a sense of belonging within Amman; 
developing an online platform to promote 
information sharing and feedback; adding 
humanitarian services to the planned 
coordination of services within Amman; 
sensitizing existing services to the unique 
needs of refugees; and designing an 
engagement strategy to ensure they 
are aware of and feel safe accessing 
services within Amman. This should have 
a particular focus on women and girls. 

3 Work through public private partnerships. 

The Amman Resilience Team should network 
and collaborate with aid and private sector 
actors to address the immediate needs 
of displaced and marginalized residents 
by including them in resilience-building 
activities and strengthening the long-term 
impact of humanitarian programming.

4 Play a leadership role in the refugee 

response within Amman. Using its 
relative administrative autonomy, 
the Amman Resilience Team can 
play a convening role in the overall 
response to the refugee crisis within 
Jordan. It should promote good 
practice at the local level not only for 
the response within other Jordanian 
cities, but also for current and future 
urban displacement crises globally.

5 Identify financing opportunities 

through foreign investment funding 
streams. To finance the City Resilience 
Strategy, GAM should identify 
opportunities that currently exist 
through initiatives such as the Jordan 
Compact and linkages with existing 
Special Economic Zones within the 
Amman Governorate (i.e. those that 
are benefitting from the simplified 
rules of origin for exporting to the 
European Union market). By working 
through public private partnerships, 
the Resilient Amman team may 
be able to leverage the interest of 
foreign companies to support the 
implementation of the strategy, 
particularly those actions that promote 
inclusive resilience and contribute to 
the economic development of the 
poorer neighborhoods in East Amman.

IRC’s proposed recommendations to 
the actions in this strategy (to make 
them more inclusive of refugees 
and marginalized residents) can be 
found throughout Chapter 3.

Amman’s Pillars, Goals and ActionsWorking with other 100RC Cities

Athens Network Exchange: Cities and the Global Migration Crisis
Amman was one of the eight 100RC cities that participated in a three-day Network Exchange organized by 100RC 
and hosted by the Municipality of Athens in September 2016. The Network Exchange provided a forum to bring 
together cities, of different sizes and geographies, to address the common challenges of migrant integration 
in urban settings. The forum allowed cities to connect with experts, share effective city practices and tools, 
learn from each other, and replicate successful ideas. Cities were represented by their Chief Resilience Officers 
(CROs) and migrant policy officials, and included Athens (Greece), Los Angeles (United States of America), 
Medellin (Colombia), Montreal (Canada), Paris (France), Ramallah (Palestine), and Thessaloniki (Greece).

ATHENS EXCHANGE
By the Numbers
•  3 DAYS of site visits, presentations and working sessions
•  8 CITIES representing 7 countries and 3 regions
•  22 RESILIENCE PRACTITIONERS including 8 CROs and 14 city staff
•  30 EXPERTS from businesses, NGO, academia, local leadership, and 100RC Platform of Partners

The forum included site visits, meeting local organizations, and working sessions to understand 
how Athens is addressing its refugee crisis and moving toward a more holistic strategy. 

Athens Network Exchange - Program Overview

DAY 1 / CHALLENGES
The day was divided into three parts. 
a) Scene setting providing context 
for the current situation in Greece, 
b) Global perspectives from the 
participating CROs on the challenge 
in their respective cities, and c) a 
panel featuring representatives 
of the migrant community and 
local organizations followed by 
site visits highlighting Athens’ 
interventions in Victoria Square and 
the Relocation Scheme Program.

DAY 2 / SOLUTIONS
Participants worked in multi-
disciplinary groups around 
the themes of infrastructure, 
social cohesion, and economic 
development, to arrive at best 
practices and new solutions 
to manage urban migration 
while building resilience. 

DAY 3 / WHAT'S NEXT
City teams synthesized findings 
from the workshop and defined 
a list of aspirations and strategic 
approaches to share with mayors, 
the broader 100RC network, and 
to establish an ongoing community 
focused on cities and migration to 
move the collective work forward.

116

Amman Resilience Strategy Outcome
The outcome of the Network Exchange included a number of Aspirations and Strategic Approaches that 
Chief Resilience Officers and other Exchange participants recommend for embracing the current migration 
crisis as an opportunity for cities to become more adaptive, cohesive, and vibrant for all their residents. 

4 Aspirations and 13 Strategic Approaches have been formulated.

Aspirations are the visions Chief Resilience Officers hold for the future to guide the way their cities plan for 
and manage urban migration

Strategic approaches are actions Chief Resilience Officers recommend for achieving their aspirations

Plan for a Dynamic Future 
By embracing global migration and incorporating 
human flows into urban planning, adaptive cities 
prepare, transform, and thrive in the face of a 
dynamic future. 

•  Incorporate migration considerations into the 

design of key services and infrastructure.

•  Establish a city-level office dedicated to the 

successful integration of newcomers. 

•  Apply migration considerations to city-wide 

plans and resilience strategies.

•  Develop more granular and coordinated data 

collection to improve integration initiatives.

Embrace Newcomers
By welcoming and integrating migrants, inclusive 
and cohesive cities become better places for all 
residents. 

•  Promote migration through a narrative that 

emphasizes common goals, values, and 
opportunities.

•  Promote initiatives that foster regular 
interactions between new and existing 
populations to strengthen communal bonds and 
mitigate the effects of false stereotypes.

•  Address migrants’ fundamental needs while 

promoting initiatives that reduce real or 
perceived competition among newcomers and 
native residents.

Thrive Together
By valuing and leveraging the talent of migrants, 
equitable cities create opportunities for all 
residents and vulnerable populations.  

•  Improve access to financial services for 

migrants and other vulnerable groups.

•  Create opportunities for migrants to generate 

income despite rigid labor markets, through 
cash-for-work programs and paid training 
schemes. 

•  Support immigrant-owned businesses 

and incorporate the needs of immigrant 
entrepreneurs into traditional economic 
development priorities and strategies.

Lead for Change
By partnering with local, national, and 
international actors, leading cities create an 
enabling environment for best managing the 
reception and integration of newcomers at the 
local level. 

•  Actively campaign to receive policy and funding 
support for better managing migrant reception 
and integration in urban areas.

•  Fill in policy and funding gaps creatively by 

tweaking local mandates and leveraging public-
private partnerships.

•  Leverage and improve coordination – at all 
stages, from planning to implementation - 
withhumanitarian aid agencies, NGOs, businesses 
and local organizations, to avoid duplications 
and maximize collective impact.

For Amman, the Network Exchange was both an inspiration and a validation for the content of our 
resilience strategy, and has catalyzed concrete actions to strengthen the role of our city as welcoming, 
united, and equal.

and communicate results of climate change research and its impacts on the city 
of Rio, as well as provide support for decision-making on urban planning and 
inform other fields of knowledge and the civil society.
Involve the civil society in the valorization of solid and organic 
waste. Minicenters of recycling and composting will be established in 
neighborhoods. Actions should involve the composting of organic residue 
for the use of residents and distribution for urban gardening and local 
agriculture, and can involve many techniques of composting, in various 
scales. Besides, those minicenters must promote opportunities to increase 
the useful life of materials, through reuse and exchange.
The Municipality of Vejle is one of few municipalities developing a holistic 
wastewater strategy that addresses the challenges of climate change, water 
supply, existing municipal water plans, and water quality. We want to pioneer 
this integrated approach and set a benchmark for other municipalities to 
develop the most efficient and sustainable solutions. The plan will provide the 
municipality with an important overview of the current systems and identify 
where further investment is needed to secure a fit-for-purpose and resilient 
wastewater system for Vejle.
A plan will be developed to future-proof the city by identifying the major 
climate hazards and their potential impact, a framework for adaptation, and 
identification of strategies to build climate resilience.
Prepare guidance on climate ready design and promote adoption by 
developers, planners and designers, particularly focusing on building retrofit 
to ensure long-term fitness for function.
Rotterdam was the first municipality in the Netherlands to successful support 
green roofs, with currently more than 220.000m2 of green roofs in Rotterdam. 
Techniques for greening roofs have developed and can now effectively cater 
to multiuse roofs including urban farming, solar panels, water storage and even 
sports facilities. These spaces can contribute enormously to the sustainability 
and viability of the city center. It contributes to a favorable climate for 
businesses, tourism and offers an attractive and healthy environment for young 
families and professionals. This action for a sustainable roofscape brings the 
enthusiasm of Rotterdam and the policy objectives together to publicize the 
many opportunities of large scale green roofs retrofit. We are aiming to create 
green roofs covering 1,000,000m2 across our city center.
Byblos will explore options to determine the optimal mix of energy sources 
to meet its demands. We will also ensure the use of incentives - such as 
tax credits, subsidies, and feed-in tariffs - and loans - like the low-interest 
NEEREA loans supported by the Central Bank of Lebanon - to promote 
the adoption of renewable energy generation and consider interventions 
to improve energy efficiency and reduce demand, particularly through 
sustainable building design and operation.

on improving local resilience (e.g. flood defenses, green infrastructure, 
community facilities and new housing). The structure would seek to blend 
public and private money and take a long term view (at least 25 years) to 
achieve a social as well as a financial return on investment.

We aim to deliver jobs and skills for local people, whilst empowering 
citizens to support projects they are passionate about, and providing key 
infrastructure assets for Bristol.
Byblos will incentivize SMEs to locate in the city by offering them space and 
communication/logistical facilities. We will build a local knowlegde base to 
promote research and innovation around our targeted industries. This will 
draw young creative entrepeneurs from local universities to settle in Byblos. 

This action will create incubators for new creative products and activities.  

This consortium will include municipalities, academic institutions, primary 
and secondary educational networks, private sector stakeholders and 
training institutes. 

These groups will collectively assess existing efforts to support young people 
from education through to early career, identifying gaps and impoving services 
available to support this process.

There is a changing role for the government, instead of a central guiding 
policy role, the role is increasingly shifting to frameworks, facilitation 
and enabling. The community and the market have increasing ambition 
to tackle social issues and therefore also expect to get more space and 
support from the government to do so. It is important that the market, 
community and government facilitate each other and find an effective 
method for cooperation and collaboration. That is the basis for a resilient 
system of governance for Rotterdam. Make it happen: the motto for the 
city encompasses this. This action is intended to ensure that we become 
more aware, that we recognize the importance of networks and platforms 
for engagement and that we share our knowledge around key initiatives.
We will develop and implement a co-creation strategy in Vejle. We 
want to be a resilient and co-creative municipality that, together 
with its citizens and civil stakeholders, create communal and better 
welfare solutions for our citizens. Through co-creation we will increase 
our resilience capacity and facilitate engaged citizen groups.

The Office of Resilience and Recovery will work closely with the Invest in 
Neighborhoods program, run by the Office of Economic and Workforce 
Development, to identify and build partnerships that advance the goals of 
this strategy. Invest in Neighborhoods works to strengthen and revitalize 
neighborhood commercial districts around the city by marshaling and 
deploying resources from city departments and nonprofit partners. This 
includes services such as loan programs, façade improvement grants and 
technical assistance for small businesses, leveraging city services to help 
small businesses thrive, increase neighborhood quality of life, improve 
overall physical conditions and, in turn, build community capacity.

Maintain the online participation of people over the four years, to use it 
as a channel for listening, through which the city’s public administration 
can keep receiving ideas for the development of Medellín.

Ensure the continuity of all critical life-safety services at a network of 
community resilience centers. Boulder will also create place-based 
platforms for assembly, cooperation and education. By basing and 
delivering community outreach, activities and other functions (e.g., mobile 
farmers markets, food trucks, fix it clinics, recycling support, etc.) from 
these locations, these centers can be integrated into the new focus on 
neighborhood- based engagement during good times as well as crisis.
Thessaloniki will establish skills development centers for both 
newcomers and long-time residents to improve the economic 
conditions for the low-income and vulnerable communities. 

The committees will be made up of 4-5 people. The representation of 
vulnerable groups will be essential in each neighborhood committee. They 
will work together to change and improve their neighborhoods to achieve 
better outcomes for the community living and working there. They will 
as well become the link between the Municipality and the community.

Stakeholder roles

Stakeholder consultation in 
development of strategy

The involvement of the city’s stakeholders was 
very important in the development of the resilience 
strategy. We brought together and consulted with 
stakeholders from different sectors of the city, 
including city officials, governmental bodies, NGO’s, 
local communities, academic institutions, and youth 
organization to discuss our resilience challenges, 
and collectively develop the opportunities for 
our resilience strategy. This has allowed us to:

•  Gather different perspectives in the process of 
shaping our strategy and the future of Amman.

•  Provide the CRO with a solid comprehensive 

understanding of the city’s current context and 
the opportunities to build resilience.

•  Build a resilience strategy that is supported and 

owned by the city as a whole.

•  Ensure transparency in building the city strategy.

•  Empower people to participate in the strategy 

development, and thereby activate the community 
and promote community cohesion.

Role of the resilience steering committee

With support from the Mayor, the CRO created an 
interdisciplinary group of city staff and non-city 
government stakeholders tasked with providing 
guidance on the development of the Amman resilience 
strategy and other associated activities. The role of 
the Amman Resilience Steering Committee include:

•  Provide advice to Amman Resilience Team on the 

content of Amman resilience strategy.

•  Act as a resource to provide the necessary data 
and best practice for Amman resilience strategy.

•  Provide social networking platform by representing 

and communicating with other stakeholders in 
cooperation with Amman city team. 

•  Provide guidance and advice to help Amman 

Resilience Team to solve any obstacles or problems.

•  Monitor performance and obtain the approval and 
support of all partners involved in the adoption of 
the city resilience strategy.

•  Assist the CRO to develop a robust, actionable 

funding strategy focused on achieving Amman’s 
resilience priorities.

Operationalizing resilience 

Operationalizing resilience is about making 
the plans proposed in the strategy happen. 
Following the release, we will start planning and 
preparing a detailed implementation plan in 
consultation and collaboration with the relevant 
stakeholders and partners. This also requires 
developing the city’s performance to deliver 
these actions in collaboration with the city’s 
stakeholders to work together, supporting one 
another to ensure objectives can be met and 
actions delivered for a more resilient Amman. 

As part of this process, the Greater Amman 
Municipality will establish a cross-sector internal 
development plan for all GAM employees to invest 
in our human capital, and support GAM vision and 
goals. GAM will also review and update internal 
municipal processes to simplify procedures and 
increase the efficiency of GAM. For example, 

providing a services center. GAM will review and 
update municipal laws and regulations to help us 
in building the city’s resilience, this will include 
updating and establishing acquisition law, planning 
law, and building law with clear responsibilities.

Additionally, in order to improve our waste 
management system, GAM will establish a 
national training center for environmental issues 
particularly waste management. The center will 
provide annual internal training to GAM employees 
and external training for other organizations and 
other cities in the region, including the proper use 
of equipment, and on health and safety issues.

Finally, GAM will establish a resilience research 
center to engage communities and community 
councils in relation to disaster preparedness, 
public health, climate action, and other services.

Monitoring and evaluation plan
4.3.1 
A description for managing and monitoring progress 
A set of indicators have been selected from GAM’s existing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
to help us monitor and evaluate our implementation progress in the short and long term.

 

GAM currently applies two sets of KPIs; international KPIs and institutional performance 
KPIs. These are derived from international city KPIs such as the Habitat Agenda KPIs 
and the Urban Child Development Index (UKID). The GAM specific KPIs are used for 
monitoring, assessment and evaluation of GAM projects specifically. The KPIs are 
divided into 7 themes; institutional performance, financial management, infrastructure, 
city branding, society, urban planning and investment, and environment and health.

Relevant GAM KPIs have been selected to monitor, review and evaluate Amman resilience 
strategy to allow us to address emerging issues, improve performance and ensure 
accountability. In addition, the Resilient Amman team will monitor implementation progress 
against the strategy pillars, goals and the resilience dividend each action set out to achieve. 

These are outlined in the summary of goals and actions in section 4.5.

 

4.3.2 
City Resilience Index First User Challenge
Amman is one of ten City Resilience Index (CRI) First User Challenge cities selected to pilot 
the CRI Online Tool. The twelve goals of the CRI correlate to the twelve drivers in the City 
Resilience Framework, and provide a complementary tool to measure and monitor the 
impact of the resilience actions. By conducting a CRI assessment, Amman will measure its 
baseline resilience performance on 156 qualitative and quantitative indicators, generating 
a qualitative and quantitative resilience profile. The qualitative profile will measure how 
Amman’s policies, and practices contribute to its resilience, while the quantitative profile 
will identify the city’s current resilience performance. Repeating the CRI assessment at 
regular intervals will provide Amman with a holistic evaluation of the impact of resilience 
actions. This process will be led by Amman’s CRO Fawzi Masad. The tool will allow the city 
to undertake a self-assessment to identify the strengths and weaknesses in its resilience 
performance using the CRI, creating a baseline to plan from and measure future progress. 
The tool guides users through a set of activities to describe their city, manage data collection 
and reporting, generate a Resilience Profile and submit a brief narrative report.

The process is expected to take between 6-8 weeks for completion. Amongst Amman’s 
motivations in applying for the First User Challenge was the opportunity to measure and 
assess our baseline resilience performance as a crucial first step for implementing and 
understanding the impacts of the Resilience Strategy. We also identified the opportunity to 
continue stakeholder engagement initiated during the strategy development process.

Sustainable Development Goals

 

Pioneered by the United Nations 
(UN) the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) include seventeen 
aspirational goals and 169 targets, 
covering a broad range of sustainable 
development issues including ending 
poverty and hunger, improving 
health and education, making cities 
more sustainable, combating climate 
change, and protecting oceans 
and forests. SDGs build on their 
predecessor Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) and have been adopted 
by the 194 countries that make-up the 
UN General Assembly. UN member 
states will be expected to use SDGs 
to frame their agendas and political 
policies over the next 15 years.

SDGs are directly relevant to 
enhancing city resilience. As 
such, in setting out our resilience 
pillars and actions, we have cross-
referenced our goals against the 
SDGs. The symbols are included 
in chapter 3 to illustrate which 
SDGs are met by each action in 
the Amman resilience strategy. 
This will allow us to compare with 
globally recognized framework 
and help us to monitor progress 
against the goals we set ourselves.

4.4 
Implementation in progress

The implementation of some of the actions in the strategy is already under way. 

Amman BRT
The implementation of the 
BRT system consists of three 
major categories, including:

1. Infrastructure (bus lanes, 

stations, terminals)

2. Operations: the operation of the 

system will be handled by a private 
operator to be selected through 
competitive bidding. The operator 
will be responsible for providing 
the buses, developing the depot, 
hiring and training drivers, as well as 
handling customer service functions.

3. Ticketing system: an effective 

payment system is essential for 
supporting the operations of the 
BRT. This is especially true for 
expediting passenger loading/
unloading and reducing the bus 
dwell time at each station.

The operation of the system can only 
take place after the completion of 
the infrastructure work. Construction 
work for the bus lanes also includes 
road work to alleviate current traffic 
congestion problems at some of the 
key intersections along the BRT routes.

The first stage of Amman BRT 
was divided into 16 construction 
packages; Package 1 and 2 are already 
constructed and Package 3 is under 
construction, the rest of the packages 
are under work for tendering :

Amman Resilience Strategy Green Amman 2020
GAM has put the environment as one of the 
municipality's top priorities, and is taking action 
to enforce legislation for the protection of the 
environment. As part of this, GAM is currently 
implementing a scheme to increase the total area 
of green open spaces in the city to make Amman 
a green and citizen-friendly capital by 2020.

Business from home licenses
Greater Amman Municipality has called on citizens 
to take advantage of regulations issued in 2012 
to facilitate businesses based from home. These 
regulations aim to provide new job opportunities 
especially for unemployed citizens, new graduates, 
housewives, and people with disabilities which 
prevent them from working outside their home.

Article VI of the professions permit regulations 
legalizes informal professions licensing, and lowers 
the financial burdens for startup businesses.

According to the regulations, businesses at home 
are divided into three categories: 1) intellectual 
professions such as advisory and design, public 
relations, secretarial, sales and marketing services; 
2) handicrafts include knitting, embroidery, 
ceramics and the decoration and manufacture of 
candles and soap; and 3) food processing services 
like jam , bakery and pickles productions, and the 
preparation of vegetables, herbs and legumes.

Feasibility study for  
Amman Metro
A study is under way to determine whether 
establishing an underground railway system in Amman 
is possible and feasible. The proposal to establish a 
metro transit system in Amman seeks to ease traffic 
congestion in the capital by providing commuters 
with transportation alternatives to private vehicles.

GAM and CROIBC/CREC, a Chinese railway 
engineering company, signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MoU) to carry out a study on the 
feasibility of establishing a metro system in Amman.

The company will look into the topography of Amman, 
its population and several other elements that 
determine the viability of such a project. Results of 
the study will be presented in two years. If the metro 
project is deemed feasible, it will be implemented 
in parallel with the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).
