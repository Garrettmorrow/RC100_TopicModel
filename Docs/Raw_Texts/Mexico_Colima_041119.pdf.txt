Letter from the Mayor of Colima

Letter from the President of 100 Resilient Cities

LEONCIO A. MORÁN SÁNCHEZ

MICHAEL BERKOWITZ 

“The  current  municipal  administra-
tion  has  from  the  beginning  been 
committed to guiding our public po-
licies  to  create  conditions  that  will 
allow our city to have the best quali-
ty of life in the country.” 

The current municipal administration has from 
the beginning been committed to guiding our 
public  policies  to  create  conditions  that  will 
allow our city to have the best quality of life 
in the country. This is the future that we have 
imagined and are determined to make a reali-
ty with the support of the citizens of our city. 
The  Colima  Resilience  Strategy  is  an  impor-
tant instrument that will guide both the capa-
city-building actions of the municipal adminis-
tration and the efforts of various local actors. 
The  Resilience  Strategy  will  help  us  address 
all  the  challenges  that  prevent  our  citizens 
from living fulfilling lives and being prepared 
for all types of future events that could adver-
sely affect both them and the city.

 
In this singular process of building a resilient 
future for our city, our task has been to com-
plete  the  work  already  planned  and  to  start 
the  implementation  phase,  which  extends  to 
2030.  This  is,  of  course,  a  great  responsibili-
ty,  but  we  assume  it  enthusiastically  and  we 
are committed to work to achieve the goals of 
the  Resilience  Strategy  initiatives  during  our 
tenure, as established in the Municipal Deve-
lopment Plan 2018-2021. Succeeding adminis-
trations will update this agenda and continue 
to ensure its evolution and benefits.
 
On  behalf  of  Colima  Municipality,  I  thank  all 
the citizens who have participated in the de-
velopment of this program to benefit our city.

On  behalf  of  100  Resilient  Cities,  I  want 
to  congratulate  the  city  of  Colima,  Mayor 
Leoncio Morán Sánchez, and Chief Resilience 
Officer Jorge Ortiz Moreno for the launch of 
the Colima Resilience Strategy, an important 
milestone  for  the  city  and  for  our  joint 
collaboration. 
The city of Colima is in the western region of 
Mexico,  surrounded  by  volcanoes  and  rivers 
and  strategically  located  76  kilometers  from 
Manzanillo, the most important port in Mexico. 
This  city  has  built  its  resilience  thanks  to  an 
active  community  and  its  capacity  to  learn 
and  take  advantage  of  new  opportunities. 
The  Colima  Resilience  Strategy  reflects  this 
capacity  and  establishes  the  vision  of  the 
city  through  an  integrated,  inclusive  lens  of 
urban resilience that identifies the impacts of 
existing and future efforts to help to achieve a 
stronger and more dynamic Colima.

The Colima Resilience Strategy recognizes the 
city’s  vulnerabilities  and  proposes  initiatives 
to address them. The Strategy leverages the 
social  capital  of  the  region  by  identifying 
opportunities for innovation and engagement 
with a population that is more than 50% under 
the age of 30 and by learning from other cities 
about  the  challenges  of  urban  expansion, 
connectivity, and sustainable development.

This  Strategy  strengthens  the  capacity  of 
Colima’s  institutions  to  address  the  impacts 
of  natural  disasters  and  build 
resilient 
communities,  and  works  with  the  municipal 
planning institute on metropolitan integration 
strategies  for  connectivity  and  management 
of the city’s water resources. 

The  Strategy  also  aims  to  work  with  the 
community  to  build  safe  public  spaces  and 
promote  projects  to  reduce  inequality  and 
violence.  Lastly,  the  Strategy  incorporates 
strong  partnerships  with  the  private  sector 
and  academia  in  the  search  for  solutions  to 
maintain  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  for 
which this city is known.

With the release of this Strategy, Colima has 
the opportunity to become a model of urban 
resilience  worldwide.  We  look  forward  to 
partnering  with  Colima  in  the  months  and 
years  to  come  as  the  Municipality  executes 
the  actions  and  initiatives  outlined  in  the 
Strategy, which will have a positive impact on 
it inhabitants. The team of 100 Resilient Cities 
could  not  be  happier  to  be  an  ally  in  these 
efforts. Congratulations to the city of Colima!

COLIMA RESILIENTELetter from the Director of the Planning
Institute for Colima Municipality (IPCO)

J. JESÚS RÍOS AGUILAR 

that  promotes  long-term  planning,  supports 
the continuity of projects, and recognizes the 
importance  of  international  cooperation,  has 
been  an  advantage  to  Colima.  Through  the 
participation  of  experts  and  interested  local 
citizens, new and better ways to run the city 
have been introduced, which have shortened 
the learning curve, and the city has shared its 
successful  local  practices  with  other  cities. 
From  The  Rockefeller  Foundation’s  first  call 
for  participation  in  its  100RC  program,  IPCO 
pushed for the inclusion of Colima, which was 
finally selected in the third call. From this mo-
ment  onwards,  IPCO  has  contributed  to  the 
institutionalization of resilience as a recogni-
zed responsibility of the municipal administra-
tion. IPCO has also participated in the develo-
pment of the Resilience Strategy, a long-term 
planning  instrument  that  will  be  a  starting 
point in the building of a Resilient Colima.

I would like to thank all the neighbors, civil so-
ciety  organizations,  academics,  local  and  in-
ternational experts, public servants, the IPCO 
team, the 100RC program, and The Rockefe-
ller Foundation for making Colima’s Resilience 
Strategy possible.

 
 
“...IPCO  pushed  for  the  inclusion  of 
Colima, which was finally selected in 
the third call. ”

Colima  is  a  medium-sized  city  in  an  area 
that,  while  rich  in  environmental  resources, 
constantly faces challenges from natural and 
man-made  disasters.  Although  the  city  has 
been  impacted  by  these  events,  in  most  ca-
ses  it  has  recovered  and  its  operations  have 
been restored to some extent but this type of 
recovery is not certain in the long-term. Such 
disasters are complex and learning from these 
experiences has not been easy or systematic. 
Consequently, we must change our response 
paradigm, use the processes that are already 
in  place  to  satisfy  current  requirements.  and 
look for new solutions to the issues that arise 
from  the  shocks  and  stresses  of  natural  and 
man-made  disasters.  The  100  Resilient  Cities 
(100RC) program presents an opportunity for 
Colima  to  better  understand  its  challenges 
and establish its own plans and strategies for 
a  systematic  response  to  and  recovery  from 
disasters.
 
Since 2006, the Planning Institute for Colima 
Municipality  (IPCO),  a  decentralized  agency 

Carta del director de resiliencia de Colima

JORGE A. ORTIZ MORENO

The Resilience Strategy is an integrated, wor-
kable plan to make Colima a prosperous, sus-
tainable, and resilient city by 2030. This plan-
ning instrument brings together a number of 
perspectives, visions, and solutions to combat 
the kinds of acute shocks and chronic stresses 
that the city has experienced in the past and 
faces  in  the  present,  and  some  of  the  future 
shocks  and  stresses  it  is  likely  to  face,  such 
as those stemming from the effects of climate 
change.

The foundational work for the Resilience Stra-
tegy began in 2016, 10 years after the creation 
of the Planning Institute for Colima Municipali-
ty (IPCO). Thus the Resilience Strategy bene-
fitted from a decade of social learning and ex-
perience in urban development and planning 
for  the  capital  city  of  Colima.  The  develop-
ment of this resilience instrument is the result 
of  a  process  of  strategic  thinking  and  parti-
cipatory  planning  that  will  serve  both  Wes-
tern Mexico and other medium-sized cities in 
other regions as a exemplary reference model 
for resilience-building processes. This project 
was  led  locally  by  the  Resilience  Office  and 
IPCO.  It  built  upon  the  collective  intelligen-
ce and knowledge of citizens and institutions 
that were involved from the beginning in 2016 
and  are  still  involved  today.  Development  of 
the  Resilience  Strategy,  however,  would  not 
have been possible without the support of the 
100  Resilient  Cities  program  and  the  contri-
butions of its many international experts. It is 
a product of the great teamwork of local and 
international partners.

“The  Resilience  Strategy  represents  a 
legacy  for  the  future  that  will  facilita-
te building the necessary capacities to 
maintain  and  ensure  the  quality  of  life 
in  Colima  in  spite  of  the  complex  so-
cioeconomic, environmental, and urban 
challenges of the 21st century.”

COLIMA RESILIENTEEXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In 2016, Colima was selected from among thousands of cities around 
the world to become part of the 100 Resilient Cities Network (100RC). 
From this moment, the municipal government began the task of pre-
paring  an  agenda  for  urban  resilience  with  the  help  of  international 
specialists,  citizens,  and  organizations  representing  different  sectors 
of society. The current Colima Resilience Strategy, which resulted from 
this initiative, is a planning instrument aimed at building a resilient city 
by 2030.   
 
The  first  phase  of  preparing  the  Resilience  Strategy  involved  identi-
fying  the  city’s  main  resilience-related  challenges  and  promoted  the 
involvement of a wide range of important local stakeholders. The se-
cond  phase  entailed  deepening  our  understanding  of  some  of  these 
challenges so that potential initiatives could be defined and developed 
to improve the resilience capacity of the city. The result is a strategic 
agenda  of  50  initiatives  supporting  12  goals  and  the  following  4  pi-
llars—all aimed at building:

- A Colima that is prepared for potential natural and
man-made risks;

- A socially and economically prosperous Colima

- An integrated urban Colima

- An environmentally sustainable Colima

The Strategy is divided into three sections. The first section is a brief 
description of the city of Colima, its context and main resilience cha-
llenges. The second explains the Strategy’s development process and 
the most relevant results of that process; and the third section, which 
focuses  on  the  vision  of  a  Resilient  Colima,  presents  the  resilience 
agenda in terms of pillars, goals, and initiatives.      

VISIÓN: Colima is a city that builds its quality of life through inno-
vation and the participation of its citizens. It is open to the world, 
resilient, and prepared to face threats, thrive inclusively, develop 
sustainably, and grow in a close, connected, and cohesive manner.

COLIMA RESILIENTEINTRODUCTION

Throughout  its  almost  500-year  history,  the 
capacity  of  the  city  of  Colima  and  its  citizens 
to  survive,  adapt,  and  move 
forward—its 
resilience  in  the  face  of  various  threats  since 
its  pre-Columbian  origins—has  been  put  to 
the  test.  Today,  the  city  of  Colima  has  grown 
to  be  a  metropolis  with  urban,  administrative, 
environmental,  and  socioeconomic  challenges. 
Among the resilience challenges facing the city 
are  acute  shocks,  such  as  earthquakes,  severe 
storms,  and  volcanic  eruptions,  as  well  as 
chronic stresses, such as high levels of violence, 
uncontrolled urban expansion, and the effects of 
climate change.
 
Given  this  context,  the  future  quality  of  life  in 
the city will depend on the actions and measures 
the  city  takes  today.  For  this  reason,  Colima’s 
municipal  government  has  led  the  building 
of  a  resilience  agenda  for  the  long  term  in 
collaboration  with  citizens  and  key  local  actors 
and  with  the  support  of  100  Resilient  Cities.  To 
implement  this  agenda  for  building  a  resilient 
future  for  the  city,  the  Resilience  Strategy 
provides  an  integrated  plan  that  includes  4 
pillars, 12 goals, and 50 initiatives.   

 
The  Strategy  is  the  product  of  a  long  technical 
analysis  and  a  citizen  participation  process 
involving  more  than  600  representatives  from 
different  sectors  of  society.  Each  initiative  was 
developed  through  studies,  workshops,  and 
recommendations  from  subject  matter  experts 
and city key partners. Likewise, in keeping with 
the  Municipal  Development  Plan  2018-2021  and 
with  the  Sustainable  Development  Objectives 
(SDGs)  of  the  United  Nations,  the  Resilience 
Strategy’s planning horizon is the year 2030.

100 Resilient Cities Program

Founded  on  The  Rockefeller  Foundation’s 
centennial anniversary in 2013, the 100RC pro-
gram  was  created  to  support  the  world’s  ci-
ties to build the resilience needed to face the 
economic,  social,  and  physical  challenges  of 
the 21st century.

 
More than 1,100 cities from all continents res-
ponded to The Rockefeller Foundation’s three 
global calls in 2013, 2014, and 2015 for appli-
cants to the 100RC program, a network of ci-
ties working together and learning from each 
other  to  build  a  more  equitable  and  resilient 
future.  Colima  responded  to  all  three  global 
calls  and  the  city  was  finally  selected  in  the 
third call, joining the network in 2016. 

 
 In joining the 100RC program, the municipa-
lity of Colima received four essential benefits:

Urban Resilience

Disciplines  such  as  ecology,  engineering, 
and  psychology 
incorporate  the  concept 
of  resilience  but  may  define  it  differently. 
Resilience for some is the ability of a system 
to respond, adapt and recover from a disaster. 
This definition has been extended to the fields 
of  disaster  risk  reduction  and  sustainability. 
In these disciplines, resilience also means the 
ability of a system to recover and maintain a 
state of balance after a natural or man-made 
disaster.

 
The  100RC  program  defines  urban  resilience 
as  the  capacity  of  individuals,  communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within a 
city to survive, adapt, and prosper despite the 
challenges they experience. These challenges 
include  acute  shocks,  such  as  earthquakes, 
floods, or outbreaks of diseases, and chronic 
stresses that can weaken the fabric of a city 
on  a  day-to-day  or  cyclical  basis.  Stresses 
on  a  city  include  high  unemployment,  social 
inequality,  air  pollution,  water  and  other 
resource shortages, and increasing violence. 

 
The  Colima  Resilience  Strategy  was  built 
upon  the  City  Resilience  Framework  (CRF), 
a  methodological  framework  developed  by 
international  consulting  firm  Arup  and  The 
Rockefeller Foundation. The CRF is a holistic, 
integrated  approach  to  analyzing  the  urban 
resilience of the cities in the 100RC program in 
a standardized way. The CRF is divided into 4 
pillars, 12 drivers, and 52 indicators.  According 
to the CRF, resilient cities demonstrate seven 
qualities;  they  are  reflective,  resourceful, 
robust,  redundant,  flexible, 
inclusive,  and 
integrated. 

15

Reflective:
Using  past  experience  to  inform 
future decisions.

Resourceful:
Recognizing  alternative  ways  to 
use resources.

Robust:
Well-conceived,  constructed  and 
managed systems.

Flexible:
Willingness  and  ability  to  adopt 
alternative strategies in response 
to changing circumstances.

Redundant:
Spare capacity purposively crea-
ted to accommodate disruption.

Inclusive:
Prioritizing broad consultation to 
create shared ownership in deci-
sion-making.

Integrated:
Bringing  together  a  range  of 
distinct systems and institutions.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT1

Since  1990,  the  conurbation 
limits  were 
redefined,  and  the  territory  consisting  of 
the  interdependent  municipalities  of  Colima, 
Villa  de  Álvarez,  Comala,  Cuauhtémoc, 
and  Coquimatlán  became  a 
flourishing 
metropolitan  area.  Finally,  at  the  beginning 
of the 20th century, the city center of Colima 
started to decline, and this situation worsened 
after  the  major  earthquake  on  January  21, 
2003.

When  the  indigenous  inhabitants  of  Colima 
were conquered by the Spanish conquistadors 
in  1523,  the  village  of  Colima  was  built  near 
the  Pacific  Ocean  on  top  of  the  old  Caxitlan 
village.  However,  in  1527  weather  conditions 
forced  its  founders  to  move  the  village  near 
Colima River, where it is located today.
 
The first homes in the city were constructed 
around  the  boundaries  of  Royal  Plaza  (now 
called Freedom Garden), which later extended 
to  the  west  across  the  Colima  River  and  to 
the east to Arroyo Manrique. The initial urban 
layout remained until the 18th century. During 
the  first  half  of  the  19th  century,  Colima 
became  a  city  and  the  state  capital,  and  by 
the  end  of  the  century,  the  city  remained  as 
a  small  settlement  surrounded  by  exuberant 
gardens  and  relatively  far  away  from  its  old 
haciendas.

 
During  the  first  half  of  20th  century  the 
conurbation  of  Colima  and  Villa  de  Álvarez 
began  to  develop  and  in  1940  the  first 
regulatory  plan  for  both  areas  was  created. 
However,  its  implementation  was  rejected 
after  an  earthquake  on  April  15,  1941,  when 
a  different  urban  layout  was  adopted  that 
included important road works, roundabouts, 
forest  ridges,  schools,  and  the  University  of 
Colima.  In  1960,  the  first  ring  road  became 
operational,  which  encompasses  the  city 
center,  and  many  peripheral  settlements 
began to appear on land that previously had 
been orchards.

REGIONAL AND METROPOLITAN CONTEXT

Colima  city  is  both  the  main  town  of  Colima 
Municipality as well as the capital of the same-
name  Mexican  State.  As  such,  it  occupies  a 
strategic position in Western Mexico. The city 
is located along the highway linking Manzanillo 
Port,  the  main  entry  for  container  ships  to 
Mexico,  with  the  Guadalajara  Metropolitan 
Area, which is the second largest metropolitan 
area in Mexico.

Currently, the conurbation of Colima and Villa 
de Álvarez is the center of the Colima-Villa de 
Álvarez Metropolitan Area (ZMCVA), which is 
home  to  359,392  inhabitants,  who  make  up 
50% of the population of the State of Colima2. 

Despite  the  fact  that  its  urban  centers  are 
physically and/or functionally connected, the 
ZMCVA is quite complex in terms of its political 
structure and governing bodies (which include 
five municipal governments, state, and federal 
entities).  Efforts  to  encourage  collaboration 
among the municipalities of the metropolitan 
area, such as the creation of the Intermunicipal 
Metropolitan  Association  of  North  Colima 
(AMINEC)  and  the  Colima  Metropolitan 
Observatory (OMECOL), have made relatively 
little impact on ZMCVA decision-making and 
governance

COLIMA RESILIENTESHOCKS AND STRESSES IN COLIMA

Strengthening  Colima’s  urban  resilience  requires  building  collective 
capacities to combat the various shocks and stresses that jeopardize 
its citizens’ well-being and quality of life. After formulating the Colima 
Resilience Strategy (described in the following chapter), it was possi-
ble to identify the city’s vulnerabilities to potential shocks as well as 
existing and future stresses.

COLIMA’S
RESILIENCE CHALLENGE 

The city of Colima today is the result of almost 
500  years  of  continuous  occupation,  and  its 
resilience depends on a number of ecological, 
political, social, economic, cultural, and urba-
nistic factors. Based on the shocks and stres-
ses  identified  and  the  analysis  undertaken  in 
developing  the  Colima  Resilience  Strategy, 
Colima’s primary resilience challenges can be 
grouped into four major areas, and these are 
described below.

Risk management

Social and economic development 

Urban development

Environmental sustainability

Risk Management

Colima  is  exposed  not  only  to  risks  from  natural  hazards  but  also 
to  risks  associated  with  human  activities  in  the  municipality  and  its 
surroundings.

 
The  city  of  Colima  is  situated  within  the  the  most  dangerous 
earthquake-prone  area  in  Mexico.12  More  than  40  local  earthquakes 
have  been  recorded  since  the  city  was  founded.13  The  most  recent, 
which occurred on January 21, 2003, killed 21 people throughout the 
state and destroyed 5,874 houses (17.5% of the total number of houses) 
and 96 schools in the municipality.14

 
Volcanic  activity  is  another  common  threat  because  of  the  city’s 
proximity to the most active volcano in Mexico, Volcán de Fuego de 
Colima.  Although  approximately  32  kilometers  lie  between  the  city 
and the volcano, ash has fallen in various occasions and there is a slight 
possibility of volcanic debris that could harm the city.15

 
Colima’s  proximity  to  the  Pacific  Ocean  exposes  the  city  to  the 
effects of tropical cyclones in the rainy season (from May to October). 
Although  the  risk  is  considered  low,17  recently  Hurricane  Jova  (a 
Category 2 hurricane) caused rivers to overflow, flooding, and damage 
to  urban  bridges.  Extreme  storms  have  also  occurred  due  to  the 
hydrometeorological  phenomena  known  as  mesoscale  convective 
systems. These systems pose a unique threat that is rarely monitored, 
although they have repeatedly caused damage.18  
 
As for risks resulting from human activities, 13 companies in the city 
of Colima are known to use hazardous substances. In addition, heavy 
vehicles use the city’s roads to transport hazardous substances from 
the  Port  of  Manzanillo  (which  is  projected  to  triple  its  capacity  by 
203219)  and  the  Peña  Colorada  mine,  located  in  Minatitlan  (which 
produces 30% of Mexico’s iron ore 20). At present, the city has no plans 
or mechanisms in place to address these risks.

Social and economic development

Stresses and events at the regional and national level have resulted in pro-
blems at the local level and challenges with respect to equitable and inclu-
sive economic development. Thus, it is extremely important that a Resilient 
Colima stop and reverse the trends and activities that can harm the social 
and economic well-being of its people.

 
Colima is moving toward demographic stabilization. Currently, 67% of the 
population  is  of  working  age  (15  to  64  years  old).21  This  is  an  economic 
opportunity that can be leveraged locally; however, it is also a challenge at 
both the local and national level now and in the future. The population is 
also aging,22 and the percentage of people of working age will not remain 
as high as it is today. An aging society can become more economically de-
pendent. Although the ZMCVA has been one of the country’s urban areas 
with a significant decrease in the socially deprived population,  approxi-
mately 30% of the city’s inhabitants are living in poverty23 and 46.7% live 
in marginal conditions.24 The low-income population is confined largely to 
large  housing  developments  in  the  southern  and  eastern  sections  of  the 
city. These areas face serious challenges, including overcrowding, low le-
vels of schooling, and limited employment opportunities or jobs with a li-
ving wage. 
 
Diversifying the local economy and increasing the city’s productivity are 
among the most important structural challenges. Currently, most jobs are 
in the trade and service sectors, which largely add little economic value. 
Services that could generate high profits for companies, and therefore high 
salaries for workers, are limited.26 Moreover, the City of Colima’s ability to 
foster development is a challenge, as it relies on money transferred from 
the federation for 70%27 of the municipal budget and has debt that restricts 
the municipality’s capacity to finance high-impact projects.28 
 
Finally, the rise in violence is probably the most critical and damaging de-
velopment in this century. In a period of less than 15 years, quality of life in 
the State of Colima, which used to have a low crime rate, has deteriorated. 
In  2017,  the  state  had  the  highest  homicide  rate  in  the  country  (106  out 
of  every  100,000  inhabitants),29  economic  losses  of  $95,486  (MXN)  per 
capita,30 and increasing gender violence in the municipality of Colima and 
other four entities. Although these issues have been attributed to fighting 
among organized crime groups for territorial control (specifically, the area 
surrounding the Port of Manzanillo), other factors (such as lack of econo-
mic opportunities for youth, weak laws, and a disfunctional criminal justice 
system) contribute to the deterioration in urban life.

Urban development

Most of the resilience challenges Colima faces with respect to urban 
development arise from the city’s expansion, which began in the 1990s 
with  the  urbanization  of  land  that  was  previously  commonly  owned 
(ejidos)  and  the  rise  of  informal  settlements.31  This  urban  sprawl 
intensified in the beginning of the 21st century as a consequence of a 
territorial policy that promoted expansion and investment in the city’s 
growing  areas.32  Between  2000  and  2015,  the  urban  area  increased 
by 85%33 (from 2,202 to 4,068 hectares), whereas the population only 
grew by 18%34 (from 119,639 to 140,909 inhabitants).

 
As a result, the city of Colima now extends across previous important 
ecological and agricultural areas. In addition, the urban area is not only 
underutilized but also has many unoccupied buildings and deteriorating 
sections.  The  city  center  continues  to  lose  occupants  and  is  still 
suffering from the damaging effects of the 2003 earthquake. Buildings 
in the city center that have high cultural, historical, and architectural 
value need to be refurbished or rebuilt.
 
Like  most  Mexican  cities,  Colima’s  development  has  followed  a 
distant, dispersed, and disconnected (3D) pattern. This has resulted in 
inefficiency and a lack of productivity that have deepened inequality 
and  contributed  to  environmental  degradation.36  This  development 
model  is  not  sustainable  because  as  the  city  expands,  the  needs 
for  resources,  equipment,  and  government  services  also  increase. 
Moreover, unplanned development could aggravate existing risks and 
stresses. For example, recent land-use changes that reduced the land’s 
water filtration capacity could be related to the growing frequency of 
floods and other natural disasters stemming from both ordinary rainfall 
as well as extreme storm events.37   

 
An increase in the number of vehicles within a city (like the 0.55 vehicle 
per person in the municipality of Colima38) and a lack of incentives to 
use public transportation and non-motorized modes of transportation 
are among the most severe consequences of this type of growth. The 
huge numbers of vehicles used for transportation combined with the 
infrastructure  to  support  them  are  increasing  the  number  of  deaths 
from traffic accidents (pedestrians and cyclists are the most vulnerable 
to this impact).39 In addition, locally, road traffic generates the most 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and produces other air pollutants.40

Environmental sustainability

The  city  of  Colima’s  resilience  depends  to  a  great  extent  on 
environmental quality and the sustainable use of natural resources, as 
well as on the city’s capacity to mitigate and adapt to the effects of 
climate change.41 In other words, strengthening the city’s environmental 
sustainability is indispensable to ensuring its resilience.

Currently, Colima faces two sustainability challenges regarding critical 
services in the city: water and solid waste management. The Colima-
Villa de Álvarez conurbation is particularly vulnerable in terms of water 
management,  as  about  80%  of  the  water  used  comes  from  a  single 
source, the Zacualpan spring,42 which is in Comala. The spring, which 
is 30 kilometers from the city of Colima, is replenished by water from 
the forests of the Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserves. Over the 
last two years, water demand has risen much faster than the available 
supply. This gap is exacerbated by urban growth and leaks in the water 
distribution network (some 35% of the output is lost43).

 
Conversely,  the  per  capita  generation  of  solid  waste  in  both  the 
municipality and the state is high: 1.18 and 1.07 kilograms per day (kg/
day),44  respectively.  Both  rates  are  significantly  above  the  national 
average  (0.85  kg/day).45  Moreover,  the  landfill  that  is  the  final 
disposal site for the five ZMCVA municipalities has serious operational 
deficiencies.  It  is  almost  at  maximum  capacity  and  accepts  waste 
that has not been separated, which causes GHG emissions. Fires have 
also occurred at the landfill. The most recent, which occurred in April 
2018, covered approximately half of the landfill’s surface and remained 
active for more than 20 days.

 
Finally, the urban portion of Colima is barely 5% of the entire municipal 
area.  The  rest  of  the  municipal  land  is  noted  for  its  biodiversity,  as 
it  contains  7  of  the  14  types  of  vegetation  described  in  the  National 
Forest Inventory (low deciduous forest, low thorny, savannah, pastures, 
lowland  forest,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  oak  forest,  gallery  forest,  and 
medium subdeciduous forests).46

The development of the Colima Resilience Stra-
tegy (Strategy) was a participatory and colla-
borative  process.  Citizens  and  academics;  re-
presentatives from the business sector; officials 
from  the  municipal,  state  and  federal  govern-
ments; residents of  the city’s most vulnerable 
areas;  and  many  others  contributed  their  opi-
nions, perspectives, and proposals to the crea-
tion of a long-term vision and agenda for buil-
ding a more resilient future for the city.     

The Colima Reslience Strategy consists of three 
main phases:

 
Phase I: In this phase, Colima’s particular con-
text  and  the  city’s  main  resilience  challenges 
were identified and analyzed. Many local actors 
were  identified  and  involved  in  the  process, 
and a Resilience Working Group and a Steering 
Committee were established. The key product 
was the Preliminary Resilience Assessment and 
a set of issues to be studied in greater depth.   

Phase II: In this phase, the issues identified by 
the  Resilience  Preliminary  Assessment  were 
studied  in  depth,  and  key  opportunities  and 
various initiatives to tackle the city’s main resi-
lience challenges were identified. In addition to 
the  various  local  actors,  international  partners 
were engaged to develop certain analyses and 
conduct specialized studies. Phase II concluded 
with the writing of the Colima Resilence Strate-
gy and its public release.

Phase  III:  This  phase  involves  completing  the 
institutionalization  of  the  Resilience  Office, 
managing  the  implementation  of  the  propo-
sed  actions  and  initiatives,  and  incorporating 
a  resilience  perspective  in  the  operations  and 
programs  of  the  municipal  government.  This 
requires  project  managing  all  aspects  of  the 
Strategy,  ensuring  sufficient  financial  resour-
ces,  building  alliances,  monitoring  completion 
of  the  Strategy,  and  adapting  the  Strategy 
going forward so that it can continue to stren-
gthen the city’s capacity to face future shocks 
and stresses.

MILESTONES IN COLIMA’S RESILIENCESTRATEGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS  PHASE I

The  initial  work  towards  building  a  Resilient  Colima  formally  started 
in  December  2016  with  the  Agenda-Setting  Workshop,  which  began 
the  process  of  identifying  the  city’s  main  shocks  and  stresses.  After 
a  public  search,  the  Colima  Chief  Resilience  Officer  was  chosen  and 
development of the Preliminary Resilience Assessment then began.

A comprehensive evaluation was performed to understand the current 
state of resilience in the city. An extensive document review and five 
analyses were conducted with the support of key local partners and 
using the following 100RC tools:

PERCEPTIONS INVENTORY: 

Qualitative analysis of the opinions and perspectives of key stakehol-
ders on the main challenges and opportunities for resilience building 
in Colima.

ACTIONS INVENTORY: 

Qualitative  analysis  of  studies,  strategies,  plans,  programs,  policies, 
and existing projects planned or implemented by the city’s stakehol-
ders.

ASSETS INVENTORY: 

Qualitative analysis of the state of the city’s most important infrastruc-
ture and urban assets (or features).

STRESSES INVENTORY: 

Qualitative analysis of the potential occurrence of various stresses ba-
sed on environmental and socioeconomic trends and developments.

SHOCKS INVENTORY:

Qualitative  analysis  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  key  shocks  to 
which the city is exposed.

Each inventory analysis was prepared from qualitative information gathered through work ses-
sions, electronic surveys, interviews, and workshops with experts, key stakeholders, and citi-
zens residing in vulnerable areas.

The results of the work completed in Phase I were documented in the Preliminary Resilience 
Assessment, and four thematic areas, or “Discovery Areas,” were identified for further analysis.

liminary Resilience Assessment:

COLIMA RESILIENTECONSULTATION

Consultation with
vulnerable communities

A focused outreach effort was conducted in collaboration with the Sciences Faculty of 
the  University  of  Colima,  the  Joint  Centre  for  Disaster  Research48  (JCDR),  and  Centro 
Machilia49 to gather the views and integrate the perspectives of socially vulnerable com-
munities in the city (who are also the most vulnerable to Colima’s natural threats) into the 
perceptions inventory.

The outreach effort was conducted in four representative areas (areas at risk from ear-
thquakes  and  floods  and  with  a  large  number  of  socially  vulnerable  people)  through 
a  workshop.  The  workshop  adapted  and  used  a  methodology  known  as  participatory 
3D mapping, which enabled the participants to identify the main shocks and stresses in 
their neighborhoods and to quantify those factors that affect or mitigate each shock and 
stress. Finally, questionnaires were distributed in person to residents who did not parti-
cipate in the workshop so that they could also identify and describe impacts associated 
with shocks and stresses.
The  results  of  these  efforts  comprise  almost  30%  of  the  city’s  perceptions  inventory. 
They  reveal  clear  differences  between  the  perspectives  of  institutional  representatives 
and  the  resilience  factors  of  particular  concern  to  vulnerable  communities.  The  latter 
include  social  stability  and  security,  infrastructure,  continuity  of  essential  services,  and 
urban mobility.

The second phase of the Colima Resilience Strategy development be-
gan in February 2017. With a public presentation on the progress of 
the workshops for the four Discovery Areas described in the Prelimi-
nary Resilience Assessment. These workshops were conducted as part 
of the “Colima in the Future” forum organized by the municipal gover-
nment to showcase the most critical initiatives for building a long-term 
vision for the city.

Subsequently, a further, in-depth analysis of the Discovery Areas was 
performed. With support from AECOM52 and other international con-
sulting firms, the Municipality conducted four studies to gain a grea-
ter, more detailed understanding of some of the challenges and issues 
identified in the Preliminary Resilience Assessment and to explore so-
lutions to be incorporated in the Colima Resilience Strategy.

STUDY

Analysis of capacity to prevent
and respond to disasters through a
resilient community perspective 

With  the  support  of  AECOM,  a  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  how  communities  in 
the city of Colima could be organized and work with the government on preparedness 
and building the city’s capacity to respond to disasters. The study also provided recom-
mendations for risk management to achieve greater social cohesion, sustainability, and 
community resilience.

The  analysis  was  carried  out  according  to  the  principles  of  the  Sendai  Framework  for 
Disaster Risk Reduction53 and with the belief that a community-based approach to disas-
ter preparedness strengthens the ability of communities to respond to emergencies and 
saves lives. To understand Colima’s particular context, the City’s recent risk management 
policies and efforts to encourage citizen participation were reviewed. Government repre-
sentatives,  academics,  and  neighborhood  organizations  also  participated  in  a  series  of 
focus groups.

As a result of this work, recommendations to support a community-based approach to 
risk management were developed based on these five guidelines:

Increasing community understanding of risk management 

• 
•  Promoting community participation in risk management
•  Strengthening neighborhood preparedness
•  Developing an initiative to ensure safe public spaces
•  Managing risks collaboratively

With the support of Ernst & Young (EY), a 100RC Platform Partner, 
the  Municipality  conducted  a  study  to  identify  value  propositions 
and  initiatives  for  innovation,  empowerment  of  business  owners 
and entrepreneurs, and diversification of the local economy.  

In addition to a qualitative analysis of the information available on 
the city of Colima and its metropolitan area, a strategy workshop 
in which more than 50 business, academic, and government repre-
sentatives participated was organized. Workshop participants dis-
cussed the needs and proposals of leaders of the city’s economic 
sectors, and developed a joint vision for Colima’s future economic 
development.
Based  on  the  analysis  and  the  participants’  priorities,  EY  recom-
mended a set of initiatives for the municipal government to intro-
duce in the short to medium term.

COLIMA RESILIENTEESTUDIO

Evaluation of urban growth
scenarios for the Colima-Villa
de Álvarez Metropolitan Area 

With  the  support  of  the  consulting  firm  Sustainable  Capital  (CAPSUS),  an  AECOM 
subcontractor,  and  IPCO,  the  Municipality  of  Colima  conducted  a  study  to  identify 
strategies  that  could  boost  the  building  of  resilience  in  the  ZMCVA  in  terms  or  urban 
growth. 

Six urban development scenarios and more than 10 interventions or “government policy 
levers”54 for 2030 were evaluated using Perfil Metropolitano 2, a platform and assessment 
tool. In work sessions attended by participants from the private sector and government 
officials  from  the  municipalities  of  Colima  and  Villa  de  Álvarez,  scenario  features  and 
policies were identified.

The  results55  show  that  the  urban  growth  described  in  the  current  urban  development 
program overestimates land needs by at least 50% and that the growth of urban sprawl 
negatively influences the results of all the indicators. Therefore, policies that encourage 
residential density in the central section of the city could contain growth and produce 
higher environmental, social, and economic benefits.

COLIMA RESILIENTEESTUDIO

Analysis of potential GHG reductions in the 
city of Colima 

With the support of AECOM and IPCO, an analysis of GHG emissions in the city of Colima was 
done to identify and prioritize areas that could require mitigation. This exercise was carried 
out  using  the  Climate  Action  for  Urban  Sustainability  tool  (CURB)  developed  by  AECOM, 
Bloomberg Philanthropies, C40 Cities, and the World Bank. 

Students from the Technological Institute of Colima were involved in the management of the 
data needed for the study, which required an extensive revision of IPCO files and official do-
cuments as well as technical queries to the municipal departments of urban development and 
public services.

The analysis results show that energy consumption in private buildings is the largest source of 
GHG emissions and vehicles are the second largest source. Based on a 2010 scenario, Colima’s 
goal is to achieve a 20% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. The greatest mitigation poten-
tial lies in reducing emissions related to the production of electricity.

COLIMA RESILIENTECROSS-CUTTING THEMES

During  the  Colima  Resilience  Strategy  development  process,  three 
cross-cutting themes were defined, which represent the requirements 
for successful management of resilience building in Colima. These the-
mes  were  first  identified  during  development  of  the  Preliminary  Re-
silience Assessment and were subsequently included in the scope of 
some of the in-depth studies of the Discovery Areas during Phase II.

Metropolitan Governance
Despite the fact that most of Colima’s resilience challenges are shared with 
the rest of the ZMCVA, collaboration between the municipal governments is 
at present limited. Each Municipality addresses its problems in isolation from 
the others. Initiatives for building resilience, however, must be presented from 
a metropolitan perspective that promotes mechanisms for coordination, co-
llaborative development, and management. 

Youth
Young people make up one of the biggest population groups of Colima and 
are an especially important asset for the development of the city. During the 
Strategy’s implementation period, they will be in the most productive years 
of their lives. Their potential to contribute to the economic, social, urban, and 
cultural transformations necessary for achieving a Resilient Colima must not 
be wasted.

Gender Perspective   
Women  in  in  the  city  of  Colima  face  a  difficult  set  of  social  and  economic 
conditions resulting from a complex web of cultural practices that make them 
very vulnerable. It is essential to acknowledge the role of women in society 
and encourage their involvement in the Strategy’s implementation and in the 
ongoing development of the city’s resilience capacity.

COLIMA RESILIENTEPILLAR 1
PREPARED COLIMA

ISSUE
Colima is not sufficiently prepared to confront the various natural and human 
hazards that put its people at risk, particularly its most vulnerable communities. 
Consequently,  theMunicipality  must  develop  and  strengthen  a  number  of 
institutional capacities related to prevention, mitigation, and response to disasters. 
Currently, these capacities are weak and face major technical, budgetary, and 
operational constraints.

A  greater  understanding  of  events  that  pose  risks  and  more  information  on 
these  risks  are  needed.  Educational  opportunities  must  be  created  so  that 
communities  can  develop  the  ability  to  manage  their  own  risks.  Establishing 
mechanisms for effective monitoring and communication of potential hazards is 
also critical for decision-making that can prevent damages and save lives.    

To  guarantee  the  safety  of  buildings  and  the  proper  functioning  of  urban 
equipment  and  infrastructure,  comprehensive  building  and  infrastructure 
assessments  must  be  performed,  Existing  buildings  must  be  reinforced  or 
modified as needed, and building regulations must be developed to ensure the 
proper construction and performance of new buildings. 

Lastly,  risk  management  in  the  city  of  Colima  must  function  based  on  a 
collaborative model in which dynamic and flexible governance allows for a wide 
range of governmental and non-governmental entities and organizations to get 
involved, and everyone must put the interests of the whole community at the 
forefront of their decision-making.

Reflective

DESCRIPTION: 
The initiative seeks to institutionalize the quantification and 
analysis of the various ways in which social vulnerability 
is expressed throughout the different population sectors 
in the municipality of Colima, with particular attention to 
young  people  and  women.  Quantitative  and  qualitative 
analysis  conducted  periodically  and  developed  through 
desk-to-field  work  and  human  resources  and  outreach 
material  will  be  considered.  The  information  generated 
by  this  initiative  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  ways 
to identify, restore, and strengthen the capacities of the 
city’s socially vulnerable population sectors to respond to 
the various threats to which the city is exposed. Thus it will 
improve the resilience capacities of the most vulnerable 
groups within the city.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
The  results  of  the  constant  analysis  will  identify  the  specific 
vulnerabilities of every sector of the city’s population and strengthen 
their response capacity to various types of threats. The results will 
also  inform  the  creation  or  modification  of  public  policies  aimed 
at  reducing  the  socioeconomic  impacts  from  natural  and  human 
hazards.

DESCRIPTION: 
This initiative involves developing a campaign to identify, 
document,  and  understand  both  historical  as  well  as 
recent  resilient  practices  in  Colima  to  mitigate  and 
prevent shocks from natural hazards. Initially, a catalogue 
of  society’s  responses  over  the  course  of  several 
centuries will be systematically created to identify those 
efforts  and  practices  that  were  positive  and  effective. 
The most feasible of these will then be summarized and 
disseminated  through  community  and  neighborhood 
associations, and incorporated in municipal policies.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Besides identifying and disseminating local knowledge, this initiative 
will  collect  information  that  can  potentially  mitigate  current  risks 
and the impacts of future natural hazards.

DESCRIPTION: 

This  initiative  consists  of  a  quantitative  analysis  of  the 
geodynamical  characteristics  of  the  Colima  and  Villa 
de  Álvarez  urban  area,  based  on—as  suggested  by  the 
CFE Seismic Design Manual—the study of environmental 
vibration records, the shear wave speed profiles, and the 
estimate  of transfer functions between sites. The results 
will provide information on different geological formations 
and the seismic behavior of the different types of land on 
which the central metropolitan area is located.  

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

The  results  of  the  study  will  be  of  the  utmost  importance  for  the 
development  of  a  seismic  design  that  is  appropriate  for  local 
conditions and to construction of buildings that will enable greater 
urban density. The benefits will contribute to a structurally safer city.

DESCRIPTION: 
This  initiative  focuses  on  updating  the  Atlas  of  Natural 
Hazards for the Municipality of Colima to include health 
and  human  hazards.  It  also  involves  identifying  the 
institutional processes required for integrating the Atlas 
into  urban  planning  and  management.  This  document 
will  provide  information  for  determining  the  areas  with 
minor  risks  from  urban  development.  Once  health  and 
human hazards are integrated into the Atlas, the goal will 
be to harmonize it with the Atlases of the other ZMCVA 
municipalities.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

This updated Atlas will help improve the decision-making processes 
for urban planning and management. Moreover, it will support the 
prevention and mitigation of risks.

initiative  aims 

DESCRIPTION: 
This 
create  monitoring  and 
communications protocols for the risks related to various 
threats to which Colima’s population is vulnerable. Among 
them are extreme storms or high winds caused by weather 
events  such  as  mesoscale  convective  systems  and 
tropical cyclones as well as air pollution from particulate 
matter  resulting  from  volcanic  activity  (volcanic  ash)  or 
agricultural  and  industrial  activity  (e.g,  fires  and  burning 
caused  by  land-use  changes.)  The  goal  is  to  model  and 
forecast  these  threats  as  they  develop,  in  real  time,  and 
communicate  information  on  them  in  a  timely  fashion. 
Communication  methods  will  be  adapted  to  different 
groups and communities, such as young people and senior 
citizens. The Faculty of Sciences of the University of Colima, 
the Mexican Red Cross (Colima Delegation), and the civil 
protection units of the municipalities of the ZMCVA have 
previously collaborated on this issue.   

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Efficient risk communication ensures that communities understand 
their  vulnerabilities  and  the  specific  actions  they  need  to  take  in 
case  of  a  disaster.  Conveying  precise  information  helps  to  ensure 
that citizens are aware of possible threats and also could prevent or 
mitigate damages as well as save lives.

DESCRIPTION: 
This  action  is  intended  to  define  a  standard  protocol 
for  society’s  response  to  volcanic  eruptions  in  which 
ash  disperses  over  the  city.  The  project  includes  a  risk 
perception  analysis  and  the  design  and  implementation 
of  an  educational  program  for  the  population.  It  will 
incorporate  the  results  of  a  recent  analysis  conducted 
by the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network on 
mitigating risks associated with the dispersal of volcanic 
ash.  Once  the  project  is  completed,  the  civil  protection 
units  of  other  ZMCVA  municipalities  will  receive  the 
results.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

Taking appropriate action to address the dispersal of volcanic ash 
strengthens  people’s  resilience  in  the  face  of  this  threat.  It  helps 
them  prevent  and  mitigate  the  effects  exposure  to  volcanic  ash 
may have on their everyday life, and it may even save lives.

DESCRIPTION: 
This  initiative  focuses  on  a  structural  assessment  of  the 
buildings  (houses,  schools,  public  or  heritage  buildings, 
among  others)  in  the  city  center  of  Colima  and  on  an 
integrated action plan for their reinforcement, maintenance, 
or relocation. In particular, buildings that have been modified 
or  repurposed  will  be  examined  for  physical  evidence  of 
structural resilience, and an analysis using numerical models 
will be conducted to forecast their behavior during shocks. 
With  regard  to  historical  architectural  styles,  materials, 
craftsmanship,  architectural  practices,  and  traditional 
construction  techniques  will  be  taken  into  account.  As  for 
school  buildings,  the  experience  on  previous  protocols 
developed  by  Greka  Architects,  Grupo  HSA,  the  Colima 
Anáhuac  College  and  Centro  Machilia  will  be  considered. 
Depending on the results, this project could be extended to 
the rest of the city or to the entire metropolitan area.  

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Implementation of the project will help ensure the structural safety 
of  buildings  in  the  center  of  the  city,  as  some  of  them  are  highly 
vulnerable  due  to  the  number  of  people  that  use  them.  the  The 
project would also reduce the economic damage and loss of lives 
from  seismic  events.  Moreover,  the  structural  reinforcement  of 
landmark  buildings  that  are  now  vulnerable  would  help  preserve 
the city’s unique heritage.

CODE

RESILIENCE QUALITIES:

Robust

DESCRIPTION: 
This initiative consists of the creation of a building code for 
Colima that establishes the requirements and specifications 
for  the  design  and  construction  of  safe,  accessible,  and 
sustainable  buildings  in  the  municipality.  The  code  will 
be  based  on  best  practices,  cutting-edge  technology, 
and  the  provisions  of  the  new  General  Law  on  Human 
Settlements, Territorial Planning, and Urban Development. 
Until  now,  these  provisions  are  supossed  to  be  found  in 
various municipal construction regulations  and technical 
standards;  therefore,  adjustments  to  the  corresponding 
municipal  regulations  will  be  necessary.  Furthermore, 
in  the  code  development  process,  strategies  will  also  be 
identified that will ensure the code’s enforcement.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Cutting-edge laws will help ensure that the city’s buildings are robust 
and  resilient  to  the  shocks  to  which  the  city  is  exposed.  Resilent 
buildings are better able to protect the lives of those who use them. 
The new code of regulations will include issues that have not been 
addressed in the current regulations, such as how buildings can be 
constructed and adapted to better withstand the effects of climate 
change.

PROSPEROUS  COLIMA

ISSUE
To build a resilient future for Colima, the local economy must be strengthened by 
improving its productivity and diversity. Efforts to ensure the city’s prosperity 
must be based on social inclusion. The economy must not marginalize vulnerable 
groups,  must  foster  job  creation  and  economic  opportunities  in  an  equitable 
manner, and must help prevent violence and juvenile delinquency. 
 
 
In  order  to  achieve  this,  the  Municipality  must  create  conditions  that  attract 
investment  and  capital,  must  attract  and  retain  human  talent,  and  must 
promote innovation as the way to create high-value economic opportunities. 
The  Municipality  should  promote  sectors  with  the  potential  for  growth, 
such  as  tourism  and  education,  and  should  work  to  harness  Colima’s  socio-
economic strengths, which are significant services and infrastructure, positive 
relationships  between  local  government  offices  and  business  organizations, 
and strong relationships with professional associations.

managing,  and  evaluating  strategic  actions  by  the 
government  and  citizens 
the 
environmental,  social,  economic  and  urban  revitalization 
of  the  city  center.  With  the  creation  of  this  agency,  it 
will  be  possible  to  evaluate  criteria  and  guidelines  for 
the  development  of  plans,  programs,  studies,  projects, 
events, actions, workgroups, and services, and to execute 
their management and implementation in a standardized 
way.  A  technical-political  committee  composed  of 
representatives  from  industry,  business,  neighborhoods, 
and  organizations  in  the  central  area  of  the  city  will 
oversee this initiative and report its results to the Colima 
City Council. The Management Plan for the Central Zone 
of the City of Colima as well as the Partial Plan for Urban 
Improvement  “Paseo  Río  Colima”  Identified  the  need  for 
this type of agency.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Greater  inclusion  and  coordination  between  different  regulatory

DESCRIPTION: 
This  initiative  will  implement  a  program  to  make  the 
processes  of  the  municipal  government  more  efficient, 
agile, and transparent through the use of information and 
communication  technologies.  The  program  will  ensure 
that citizens can make payments and request documents 
and  services  online.  The  aim  is  to  redesign  processes 
and  implement  changes  that  support  new,  automated 
processes;  revise  and  adjust  current  regulations  so  that 
government authority can be validated electronically; and 
begin  a  communications  campaign  targeted  to  citizens 
and public servants that includes a change management 
strategy.  This  project  will  build  on  previous  efforts 
to  simplify  the  application  process  for  business  and 
construction licenses, and will become the foundation of 
more complex plans for the urban electronic infrastructure 
in the future. 

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

Facilitating  the  application  process  for  business  or  event  permits 
and licenses is an attractive way to foster investment and increase 
municipal revenue. Furthermore, digital data management will help

both  an  economic  and  tourism  perspective.  To  achieve 
this,  the  initiative’s  workplan  will  address  four  areas: 
connectivity  (free  Wi-Fi  hotspots),  security  (smart 
cameras,  panic  buttons,  and  LED  lighting),  alerts  (real-
time alerts for traffic, climate, and pollution updates), and 
marketing (brand logo associated with the initiative).

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
A new image of the city center as a place of innovation and safety, 
new  economic  opportunities,  urban  renewal,  citizen  participation, 
and  collaborations  between  institutions  are  among  the  expected 
benefits.

DESCRIPTION: 
This  initiative  will  establish  an  educational  institute 
focused on the identification, development and fostering 
of  Mexican  talent  based  on  two  approaches:  the  first 
aims  to  address  the  growing  need  for  high-quality 
software  developers  through  an  intensive,  specialized 
mentoring  program  that  will  help  recent,  inexperienced 
graduate students or software developers to work in top 
software companies; and the second is a new approach 
to  improve  the  development  conditions  and  well-being 
of economically vulnerable groups, such as young people 
and women, through a technological skills development 
program that helps them enter the labor market or build 
quality  self-employment,  which  will  contribute  to  the 
improvement of society.  

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

In addition to including and integrating the economically vulnerable 
population in the labor market, this initiative will help build adaptive 
capacities for upcoming technological changes, such as robotization 
and automation.

a  focus  on  young  people  and  women-led  businesses) 
that offer neighborhood services, such as grocery stores. 
This initiative seeks to stop the  disappearance of small 
neighborhood  businesses,  which  are  primarily  located 
in the poorest parts of the city. This negative trend has 
contributed to economic inequality in the city and to the 
socioeconomic vulnerability of low- and medium-income 
households.      

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

Initiatives that strengthen and support small and medium businesses 
are very important to reducing social isolation, inequality, and the 
effects of poverty. This initiative could also help businesses continue 
to operate after a disaster.

DESCRIPTION: 
This 
initiative  aims  to  strategically  strengthen  the 
operations of the General Directorate of Public Security 
and  Traffic  Police  regarding  the  oversight,  prosecution, 
and  tracking  of  crimes  committed  by  minors  and  other 
social  conflicts  arising  from  the  challenging  conditions 
of  urban  life.  It  incorporates  best  practices  that  have 
been effective in reducing crime rates and improving the 
public perception of security in the city. A “Civic Judge” 
has  been  appointed  within  the  organizational  structure 
of the municipality, a municipal commission for the social 
prevention  of  violence  has  been  established,  and  the 
municipal  government  has  assumed  responsibility  for 
public security, which was formerly the responsibility of 
the state government.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Improving  institutional  capacities  for  addressing,  monitoring,  and 
resolving social conflicts and violations of laws can prevent conflicts 
from escalating into crimes and violence. It could also increase the 
population’s  confidence  in  the  ability  of  government  officials  to 
ensure peace and security in the city.

These  activities  will  incorporate  recommendations  from 
the Gender Violence Alert for the Municipality of Colima.  

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

The  prevention  of  gender  violence  is  an  urgent  need.  Gender 
violence affects the social development as well as the physical and 
mental health of girls, adolescents, and women, and it contributes 
to  inequality  and  discrimination.  This  initiative  aims  to  empower 
women  and  girls,  and  to  ultimately  benefit  the  communities  in 
which they live.

DESCRIPTION: 
This  initiative  will  create  a  network  of  public  spaces 
designed with resilience elements, such as environmental 
technologies and green infrastructure. Each public space 
will  contain  a  “security  point”  where  neighbors  and 
government officials can gather when a crisis or disaster 
occurs. The initiative also aims to promote activities and 
events protected by the police and featuring music and 
dance  as  well  as  opportunities  for  exchanging  ideas  on 
projects to improve and beautify the city’s neighborhoods. 
In 2018, a map was produced of the 108 potential security 
points  identified  by  the  Municipal  Civil  Protection  Unit, 
the Directorate of Citizen Participation, and the General 
Directorate of Public Security and Traffic Police.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

Communities  that  are  organized  to  improve  the  security  of  their 
neighborhoods and that know how to respond to crime generally 
have  capacities  that  will  allow  them  to  organize  to  prevent  and 
mitigate  other  types  of  human  and  natural  threats.  This  is  an 
important  opportunity  to  improve  community  response  and 
resilience capacities across the city.

RESILIENT PARK
ORIENTAL GARDEN
A  community-designed  public  space  called 
the  Oriental  Garden,  which  was  to  be  built 
over  part  of  an  old  street,  was  canceled 
in  1999  when  the  city’s  east  bypass  was 
constructed.  During the second half of 2018, 
the  Municipality  completed  the  construction 
of the Oriental Garden. The park’s neighbors 
had  worked  for  more  than  20  years  to 
convince the city to transform the field into a 
public recreation space.

The new park’s security point not only serves 
as  a  meeting  point  for  neighbors  and  public 
officials  when  there  is  an  emergency,  but 
is  also  a  symbol  of  the  now  Resilient  Park 
because it became a shelter for the neighbors 
during  the  aftershocks  of  the  earthquake  on 
January 21, 2003.

This  was  the  first  park  designed  from  the 
start according to the guidelines of the IPCO 
Handbook  on  Participatory  Processes  for 
the  Design  of  Public  Spaces.  Moreover,  the 
project  forms  part  of  the  implementation  of 
the commitments set out in the Memorandum 
of  Understanding  between  SEDATU  and  100 
Resilient Cities in 2017.

PILLAR 3
INTEGRATED COLIMA

ISSUE
Colima needs to move away from its distant, dispersed, and disconnected urban 
development  pattern  and  transform  itself  into  a  more  compact,  connected. 
and equitable city. To achieve this, existing urban planning initiatives must be 
strengthened  and  a  a  new  urban  planning  and  management  model  must  be 
adopt at the metropolitan level.
 
To better integrate the city, mobility problems must be addressed, particularly 
by  promoting  non-motorized  modes  of  transportation  and  by  improving  the 
quality and conditions of public transport. Changes in the urban infrastructure 
that facilitate accessibility and road safety are needed
 
Lastly, the expansion of the city must be contained to avoid the environmental, 
economic,  and  social  impacts  of  uncontrolled  and  unplanned  growth,  and 
to  achieve  this,  the  Municipality  must  promote  occupancy  within  its  urban 
boundaries and more density in the city’s central area.

DESCRIPTION: 
This  initiative  will  develop  and  implement  the  PDU  of 
the conurbation, a planning instrument that will identify 
the provisions, urban strategies, and general policies for 
urban  development  in  the  municipal  capitals  of  Colima 
and Villa de Álvarez. Its goal is to balance the tasks and 
benefits  of  urban  renewal,  optimization,  and  territorial 
management  between  the  two  municipalities  with  an 
integrated  approach.  It  will  also  encourage  an  urban 
model  of  reslience  that  incorporates  the  conurbation’s 
vision  of  a  metropolitan  area  aligned  with  new  state 
and federal regulations for human settlements, land-use 
planning, and urban development.         

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Implementing  the  program  will  encourage  establishment  of  an 
urbanization  process  that  is  transparent  and  takes  into  account 
the  interests  and  needs  of  all  citizens  with  respect  to  territorial 
development, and that therefore contributes to the quality of life of 
everyone living in the conurbation.

goals  and  strategies  for  planning  and  managing  human 
settlements within the municipality to achieve sustainable 
urban  development.  The  PMDUOET  defines  land-use 
and  zoning  regulations  for  the  municipal  territory  that 
correspond  to  the  needs  of  its  inhabitants.  Unlike  the 
PDU,  which  is  an  instrument  limited  to  the  central  area 
of the city, this program regulates all the local and urban 
communities of the municipality. Land management and 
planning  initiatives  and  strategic  projects  that  provide 
solutions  to  the  different  territorial  needs  and  issues  in 
Colima will be implemented.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
This program will contribute to the development of public policies 
regarding  human  settlements, 
land-use  planning,  and  urban 
development.  It  will  focus  on  building  an  urban-rural  network 
that does not excessively strain natural resources. In other words, 
the  program  will  define  how  the  city  can  transition  to  an  orderly, 
equitable and inclusive urban development model.

This initiative focuses on implementing the PPMU, which 
was  recently  approved  by  the  municipal  council.  It 
includes  strategies  for  integrating  the  Colima  River  into 
the  urban  and  economic  structure  of  the  city  center. 
These  strategies  will  be  based  on    the  emerging  needs 
of  the  population  and  will  aim  to  transform  the  river 
into  a  healthy,  safe  environment  that  is  a  model  for  the 
conservation  of  local  biodiversity.  An  urban  marketing 
plan,  a  program  for  human  development  and  social 
cohesion through art, a program for the restoration and 
conservation of the river’s hydraulic conditions, a protocol 
for  citizen  response  to  risks  and  disasters,  and  projects 
for safe streets and open public spaces along the river are 
among the initiatives envisaged in the program.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Implementation  of  the  PPMU  Paseo  Río  Colima  will  help  Colima 
capitalize on the important productive capacity of the central part 
of  the  city.  It  will  also  reduce  the  pressure  on  the  municipality’s 
natural  areas,  which  are  currently  cut  off  from  the  social  and 
economic vitality of the central area.

on two types of underutilized or abandoned property: ur-
ban wasteland in the city and urban wasteland in the city 
center. First, a geostatistical analysis must be performed 
to identify, quantify, and classify the wastelands so that 
land-use policy changes and promotion can be made to 
incorporate them in the real estate market.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Better  use  of  urban  land  could  help  increase  proximity  to  trans-
portation, employment, and urban services for at least 20% of the 
population of the ZMCVA by 2030.

housing  in  the  central  area  of  the  city  of  Colima,  which 
plans  to  reach  a  density  of  20  households  per  hectare 
(the minimum stated preliminarily by the PMDUOET). The 
initiative aims to facilitate the restoration and preservation 
of historic buildings through tax incentives proposed by 
the INAH, such as an exemption from property taxes. The 
Regulation of Investment Incentives for the Municipality 
of  Colima  and  the  Regulation  for  the  Protection  and 
Sustainable  Revitalization  of  Buildings  in  the  Historic 
City  Center  of  Colima  set  a  precedent  for  this  initiative. 
This program will attract young people to live in the city 
center,  where  the  city’s  senior  population  is  currently 
concentrated.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Policies which encourage residential density in the central section 
of the city foster high-density but planned growth and produce a

DESCRIPTION: 
This initiative will integrate a number of strategic projects, 
and  their  schedules  and  construction  activities,  so  that 
the  remodeling  of  the  city’s  main  road  axes  will  include 
resilience and sustainable mobility concepts. In particular, 
it  will  promote  the  criteria  for  a  Complete  Street.  This 
means that the road design must be inclusive, i.e., it must 
accommodate pedestrians of all age groups and with all 
types of motor skills, and all means of transport (bicycles, 
motorcycles,  buses,  and  cars).  Preliminary  proposals 
to  redesign  Niños  Héroes  Avenue,  Boulevard  Carlos 
de  la  Madrid  Béjar,  and  Boulevard  Camino  Real  will  be 
examined through a “resilience lens.”    

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

Implementing this project will help improve the city’s image, increase 
property  values,  and  reduce  road  accidents.  It  will  particularly 
benefit pedestrians from the neighborhoods surrounding the main 
road  axes  and  the  cyclists  who  ride  across  the  Colima-Villa  de

DESCRIPTION: 
The RITS will integrate the different modes of public transportation 
in  the  state  of  Colima  under  a  single  entity  that  will  manage 
operations,  infrastructure,  image,  information,  tariff,  and  service 
quality. This long-term project requires a solid foundation based 
on six main governing principles: management and regulation of 
transport operations, service quality and infrastructure based on 
user  needs,  sufficient  infrastructure  for  operations,  a  collection 
system,  business  organization,  and  institutional  strengthening. 
The size of the state is such that its inhabitants have been able to 
commute daily to the largest urban centers to access services and 
satisfy daily needs; however, this becomes harder everyday. That 
is  why  the  project’s  main  goal  is  to  implement  a  new  transport 
system that takes advantage of the current territorial conditions. 
More  control  over  public  transport  will  improve  safety  and 
accessibility  for  users.  It  will  also  facilitate  measures  to  prevent 
gender  violence  and  provide  fare  discounts  for  students  and 
senior citizens.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
Ensuring that the transport systems can continue to operate during any type of 
man-made or natural crisis is essential for the resilience of the city. The project 
also aims to ensure that the population’s daily life does not result in any activity 
that could produce accumulated stress. Therefore, to ensure the quality of life 
for everyone in the state of Colima, implementation of this project is a priority.

DESCRIPTION: 
This  project  will  formalize  and  improve  public  trans-
port  stops,  i.e.,  the  zones  or  areas  from  which  any  user 
of public transport accesses the system, which can vary 
depending  on  physical  conditions  and  service  demand. 
The infrastructure of the stops is a key and indispensable 
component to the transformation of public transport, ex-
pected after the implantation of the RITS at a state level. 
It  works  as  a  platform  to  integrate  the  rest  of  the  RITS 
components given that with its implementation there will 
be  improvements  in  the  cost  efficiency  to  provide  the 
service without the need to reduce the current supply.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

The  population  will  be  able  to  enter  the  transport  system  in  a 
safe,  accessible,  and  connected  manner  from  the  different  stops, 
which reflect service demand and user needs. This implementation 
is  essential  for  the  correct  functioning  of  the  service,  during  both 
normal  conditions  and  periods  of  crisis.  Moreover,  improving 
access  to  public  transport  could  help  prevent  incidents  of  sexual 
harassment and gender violence.

under way, some tactical urban activities will be held to 
promote the project and provide road safety education.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

This type of infrastructure not only protects pedestrians, who are 
the most vulnerable population in the mobility pyramid, but it also 
makes daily walking more attractive and comfortable (walks make 
up  33.8%  of  the  daily  trips  in  the  city  of  Colima).  Moreover,  the 
project could help replace motorized travel with travel by foot, thus 
reducing GHG emissions and improving people’s health.

particular). Feasibility studies for the city of Colima and 
some strategic projects at a metropolitan level have been 
completed. This initiative will be linked to Action 3.3.1 to 
establish  a  non-motorized  mobility  network  throughout 
the ZMCVA.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

Providing a safer bicycle network infrastructure for existing bi-
cyclists could increase the number of short bicycle and intermo-
dal trips and thereby decrease the number of motorized trips, 
thus reducing GHG emissions.

DESCRIPTION: 
This  initiative  aims  to  implement  an  action  plan  with 
measures  to  reduce  road  traffic  accidents  (and  thereby 
deaths), medical costs, and damage to public roads and 
private property. The initiative will be based on a study 
that analyzes the current status of road safety in the city, 
with  a  focus  on  physical,  administrative,  and  political 
issues.  The  study  will  also  review  various  proposals  for 
projects to mitigate these issues.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

In Colima previous experience has shown that traffic incidents could 
be reduced by alcohol-level tests on weekends and holidays, talks 
on road safety, and lower speed limits in specific areas of the city 
(Zonas 30), among other actions. Implementing this plan will have 
a positive impact on risk reduction and improve the prevention and 
response to road accidents.

city. The plan will enhance the current transport system by 
integrating  new  transport  modes  and  encouraging  non-
motorized mobility. To encourage walking, this initiative 
aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  built  environment, 
which  will  also  increase  tourist  and  commercial  activity 
in the area.

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

Mobility is one of the main challenges to increasing economic activity 
in  the  area;  consequently,  the  benefits  from  the  resilience  project 
are  multidimensional.  Improving  mobility  along  with  improving 
the quality of the built environment will have the added benefit of 
enhancing  accessibility  for  vulnerable  users,  such  as  people  with

COLIMA RESILIENTEPILLAR 4
SUSTAINABLE COLIMA

ISSUE
Colima’s  resilience  is  inseparable  from  the  city’s  environmental  sustainability. 
Therefore,  Colima  must  lay  the  groundwork  for  a  municipal  policy  that  ensures 
the  proper  utilization  of  natural  resources,  minimizes  the  city’s  impacts  on  the 
environment, and fosters mitigation and adaptation to climate change from both 
a multi-institutional and metropolitan perspective.   
 
The  Municipality  must  encourage  actions  that  reduce  local  GHG  emissions,  in 
particular  those  generated  by  energy  consumption  in  buildings  and  by  various 
modes of transportation, to fulfill the national commitment to the goal of the Paris 
Agreement of a 22% emissions reduction by 2030. In addition, some public services 
such as water supply and urban solid waste management must be transformed to 
be implemented from an integrated perspective that considers systemic aspects 
such as the water cycle and circular.
 
Finally, Colima must recognize the importance and value of the ecosystems inside 
and outside the city and promote measures aimed at preserving biodiversity.

DESCRIPTION:
This  initiative  analyzes  energy  use  and  consumption. 
It  reviews  various  initiatives  that  can  increase  energy 
efficiency and expand the existing capacity of renewable 
energy  in  the  city.  Both  changes  to  municipal  buildings 
and  regulatory  changes  that  encourage  energy-related 
requirements 
in  new  construction  and  real-estate 
developments  are  being  considered.  Photovoltaic 
systems to generate electricity, photothermal systems to 
heat water, and construction systems and electrical grids 
for the efficient use of energy are among the technologies 
that could be used. 

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

This initiative will help to mitigate GHG emissions and to expand the 
installed capacity of decentralized systems to generate renewable 
energy, which could come into operation if the centralized systems 
of energy production and distribution fail after a shock. Moreover, 
it will help reduce operational costs in municipal buildings and help 
manage the increasing energy demand.

DESCRIPTION:
This  initiative  will  renovate  the  street  lighting  system 
by  replacing  the  current  high-pressure  sodium  vapor 
technology  lamps  with  LED  technology.  The  transition 
will  be  implemented  incrementally,  starting  with  areas 
that particularly need to be well-lit for safety reasons (for 
example, places that are popular and frequented at night, 
such as the city center).

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 
At present, 85% of the lamps in the street lighting system fail every 
year, often leaving roads and areas of the city with no service for 
days or weeks. This project will therefore not only help to improve 
lightning in the city but will also improve the safety of public spaces 
throughout the city. Moreover, it could reduce energy consumption 
as much as 35% per year, which would be a significant cost savings. 
Lastly, the project will also contribute to mitigating GHG emissions.

DESCRIPTION:
This  initiative  establishes  several  collection  centers  for  urban 
solid  waste  in  some  neighborhood  community  spaces  (parks, 
gardens, or sports facilities) so that the inhabitants can separate 
their waste; manage the collection, monetization, and marketing 
of  the  waste  themselves;  and  use  the  resources  obtained  to 
improve the community in ways previously determined through 
consensus. This project would first need to raise environmental 
awareness  and  teach  waste  separation  through  courses,  talks, 
and  workshops.  Collection  center  containers  should  facilitate 
the separation of the solid waste (plastic, aluminum, glass, paper 
and cardboard, and used vegetable oil), and it should promote a 
culture of solid waste management (recycled and reused waste) 
instead of a culture of garbage. The initiative aims to continue the 
effort of the neighborhood of Las Palmas, and create a scalable, 
replicable pilot project for other areas of the municipality or the 
ZMCVA. 

RESILIENCE BENEFITS: 

Inadequate  urban  waste  management  in  Colima  is  a  critical  issue,  that  has 
already resulted in crises, including a fire in the municipal sanitary landfill in 2018. 
This initiative will not only help reduce the amount of solid waste that arrives at 
the final disposal site, it will also allow the municipal government to reduce the 
operating costs of the sanitation service, and neighbors will have an opportunity 
to generate extra income for environmental improvements in their communities.

COLIMA RESILIENTEINSTITUTIONALIZATION OF
THE RESILIENCE STRATEGY

In developing the Resilience Strategy, Colima has made adjustments 
in the structure and operations of the municipal government so that 
resilience can be institutionalized. First, the Municipal Council of Colima 
approved an agreement in December 2016 that modifies the municipal 
government  regulation  regarding  creation  of  a  Resilience  Office. 
Moreover, in January 2018, the Municipal Council of Social Participation 
for  Planning  agreed  to  participate  on  the  city’s  Resilience  Steering 
Committee. Thus, there is now an entity responsible for managing and 
monitoring the actions defined in the Strategy and a collegial body of 
representatives from the private sector, the academic world, and civil 
society committed to monitoring and supporting its implementation.
 
The current administration 2018-2021, headed by Mayor Leoncio Morán 
Sánchez, is committed to working towards the implementation of the 
actions defined in the Resilience Strategy after incorporating them in 
the Municipal Development Plan, and linking short-term and long-term 
goals. This is the first of four municipal administrations, which during 
the 2019-2030 period, will have a guiding instrument for improving the 
resilience of the city and thereby the living conditions of its inhabitants.
 
For  Resilient  Colima,  the  institutionalization  of  the  Resilience  Office 
must be completed and the municipal administration must encourage 
the implementation of the Strategy’s actions in coordination with local, 
national, and international partners. The Colima Resilience Strategy is 
a living document that can be updated and modified depending on the 
evolving challenges and priorities of the city. That is why, in addition 
to monitoring compliance with the Strategy, the Resilience Office will 
ensure the relevance of the Strategy to the challenges and priorities of 
the city as they evolve.

We invite you to join this initiative and together we will build a resilient 
future for the city of Colima.
