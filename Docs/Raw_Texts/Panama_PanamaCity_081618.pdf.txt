José Isabel Blandón
MAYOR OF DISTRICT OF PANAMA

Panama City will soon be reaching its 500th an-
niversary since its foundation. It will be a special 
date for us to commemorate and come back to-
gether to our past, while thinking about the future 
we wish for our city.

One  year  earlier,  we  set  a  countdown  to  this 
historic  date,  with  a  presentation  of  Panama’s 
Resilience  Strategy,  imbued  with  a comprehen-
sive, long-term vision. It has been a titanic effort, 
which  wouldn’t  have  been  possible  without  the 
support  and  timely  advice  of  the  100  Resilient 
Cities  Program  of  the  Rockefeller  Foundation. 
Today, rather than a phase coming to an end, it’s 
the beginning of a new chapter, full of challenges 
and  opportunities  for  this  capital  District  of  our 
beautiful country, Panama.

In 2016, when we received the great news of Pan-
ama’s  acceptance  within  the  program,  and  thus 
being  the  only  city  in  Central  America  to  be  a 
part of it, I expressed that, for this local Govern-
ment, it was a great honor but, above all, a huge 
challenge.  A challenge that we have undertaken 
with great responsibility and enthusiasm.  I wish 
to  recognize  the  efforts  made  by  our  Resilience 
Division and by all the teams in the Mayor’s Of-
fice taking part in the making of this Strategy, as 
well as thank all the other governmental and pri-
vate players, including the citizens who did their 
bit to help in the creation of such Strategy.

This Strategy is intended to serve as a guideline 
for any relevant course of action. It is not intended 
to be a lifeless document to be shelved in a hidden 
drawer, but it aims to serve as a living guideline 
bound to spark debate and encourage the launch-
ing of specific measures, with such actions having 
a diverse approach, as in access to opportunities 
for citizens, the needs for infrastructure connect-
ing the citizens in the neighborhoods, our ecosys-
tems, and our preparedness for risks and liabilities 
we all have in building this city.

We thus set out in this journey with the optimism 
and  joy  that  characterizes  our  people,  with  the 
assurance  that  there’s  no  goal  impossible  to  ac-
complish  when  we  work  together  to  achieve  it. 
We are the small country that nowadays is suc-
cessfully  managing  the  Canal,  at  the  service  of 
world trade. We are the country with one of the 
most vibrant economies in Latin America. We are 
the oldest city founded by the Europeans in the 
Pacific littoral of the Continent, the only Central 
American nation to enter the Network of 100 Re-
silient Cities and the very first one in the region to 
be declared by the UNESCO as Creative City.  
We are embarking on this new challenge that we 
are now undertaking with full awareness of its im-
portance and the firm conviction of pursuing the 
strategy outlined in each and every one of its in-
tegral items.

Our city has always been oriented towards inter-
national trade, for its identity is diverse and built 
upon the successive waves of immigrants. A city 
with many contradictions, where we feel Caribbe-
an from the cultural point of view, despite being 
geographically  located  on  the  Pacific  littoral.  A 
city that has boomed vigorously, without taking 
enough time for its planning. These factors have 
all given rise to an extraordinary, heterogeneous 
city, rich in nuances and with its own strengths 
and  weaknesses,  as  well  as  structural  problems 
that do have a solution, but which do require a lot 
of attention.

 Being both diverse and global, 
Panama city aspires to be more 

sustainable, more human and more 

resilient.

The making of this Resilience Strategy has given 
us the opportunity to develop an inward-looking 
perspective. To evaluate ourselves both as citizens 
and as a city as a whole. To admit our defects and 
feel  proud  of  our  virtues.  The  current  situation 
has been ideal for us to define the concept of re-
silience and how we will apply it “in the Panama-
nian way”, but benefiting us from the experience 
of the other cities in the Network.

Panama recognizes itself as a diverse and global 
city aspiring to be more sustainable, more human 
and more resilient. We have identified our major 
risks as well as the main lines of action to tack-
le and prevent them, and always get back on our 
feet,  no  matter  how  hard  the  circumstances  we 
might have to face may be.

RESILIENT PANAMAResilient Panama, however, is trying to set Pan-
ama City at the forefront of the urban resilience 
practice. This strategy reflects the amazing prog-
ress that the city has achieved in understanding 
its  natural  assets  and  vulnerabilities,  as  well  as 
how  opportunities  keep  cropping  up  to  develop 
its strengths and adaptability.

Panamanians  play  a  key  role  in  this  resilience 
strategy. Well-known for their solidarity, energy 
and  inventiveness,  Panamanians  are  also  a  truly 
diverse people. Panama City has a large indige-
nous and Afro-Panamanian community, together 
with a constant migration inflow from European 
and  Asian  countries.  By  acknowledging  the  di-
versity of its citizens, Panama’s Resilience Strate-
gy addresses inequalities and fosters an enhanced 
quality of life for all Panamanian inhabitants.

With other approaches, such as risk management, 
administrative  improvement,  the  promotion  of 
citizen  engagement  and  the  protection  of  natu-
ral resources, Panama City’s Resilience Strategy 
shows a many-sided and comprehensive vision of 
the building of resilience in its city.

This  strategy  is  merely  the  beginning  of  the 
exciting work ahead and the long-lasting impact 
bound  to  be  caused  by  this  significant  leap 
forward, whether in the next few months, years 
or even decades to come. From now on, Panama 
City  may  begin  to  implement,  jointly  with  its 
allies, the actions and initiatives presented in this 
Strategy, which will have a positive impact upon 
its citizens and will surely lead the way towards 
resilient  cities  in  the  future.  Congratulations 
Panama City!

Michael Berkowitz 
PRESIDENT OF 100 RESILIENT CITIES 

On  behalf of  all  teams  at  100  Resilient Cities,  I 
would like to congratulate Panama City, its Mayor 
Mr.  Blandon  and  the  Resilience  Director,  Mr. 
Arturo Dominici, on the launch of this strategy: 
Resilient Panama. Panama’s Resilience Strategy 
establishes a clear vision of urban resilience that 
may serve as a role model for other cities around 
the world. We’re excited to see how this ambitious 
strategy takes shape and gets us ready for a more 
flexible and dynamic Panama City.

Being both the capital and the largest city in Pan-
ama, we’re sure that it will be an example to be 
followed  as  it  expands  this  movement  of  global 
resilience throughout the country and beyond!

Panama  City  takes  pride  in  having  an  intimate 
rapport with nature, as it is bounded by the Pa-
cific Ocean. The Panama Canal -the largest infra-
structure project in history- has been one of the 
most  important  commercial  assets  in  the  world 
as  well  as  a  wonder  of  engineering  ever  since 
its opening in 1914. Nevertheless, the threats of 
urban development and climate change have al-
ready  started  to  bring  about  some  acute  shocks 
and chronic stresses to the natural infrastructure 
built in Panama City, as well as on water supply 
and citizenship as a whole.

Many of those beaches enjoyed by our own un-
cles  and  grandparents  have  been  disappearing.  
Both  land  fills  and  concrete  belts  have  become 
commonplace, while at the same time we ignore 
our rivers and wetlands, which today, as we can 
see, are largely used as deposits of liquid and solid 
waste  materials.  We  don’t  see  the  possibility  of 
creating systems that can adequately connect us, 
for instance, by public means of transportation, as 
we have a deeply-rooted culture centered on the 
use of cars.  

 This Resilience Strategy is a key 
instrument to addressing social, 
economic, and environmental risks 

We still have lots of natural, cultural and human 
capital to discover, recover and preserve, as new 
ordering plans have been developing at the local 
level, in order to address decades of development 
restraints, as well as deficient urban planning. 

Decentralization brings about the opportunity for 
local  authorities  to  provide  support  to  all  of  the 
players involved by engaging them in an integrat-
ed  fashion  and  encouraging  them  to  participate 
in the search for new schemes, experiences and 
opportunities and, on this occasion, a comprehen-
sive Resilience Strategy reaffirms and calls for civ-
ic engagement in the execution of their projects.

Arturo Dominici Arosemena
RESILIENCE DIRECTOR,  
DISTRICT OF PANAMA

Panama City is located in an area of constant so-
cial  and  environmental  changes.    It  is  a  strip  of 
land home to highly rich biodiversity comprised 
of living organisms evolving from both regions of 
the Neotropics, living together within jungles and 
wetlands. 

Ever since pre-Columbian times, it is a meeting 
point for both persons and goods that play a key 
role across development and connectivity of hu-
man  populations.  What  originally  seemed  to  be 
areas  impossible  to  inhabit  could  later  begin  to 
be settled thanks to the advances in eradicating 
yellow fever and malaria. Today, we can perceive 
a  vibrant  city,  where  many  living  organisms  in-
tegrate within a single system, including waters, 
boats, merchants, immigrants, builders, fishermen 
and farmers, among others. 

Hidden  nearby  or  away  from  skyscrapers  and 
modern shopping malls are some areas where our 
fellow  citizens  suffer  from  the  shortage  of  basic 
utility services, poverty and insecurity. These sit-
uations reveal that the benefits of our “booming” 
economy have yet to reach the bulk of our popu-
lation as a whole.

RESILIENT PANAMAThis  Strategy  is  a  key  instrument  to  setting 
priorities  when  tackling  social,  economic  and 
environmental  risks,  and  even  though  it  will 
not  manage  to  provide  us  with  a  solution  to  all 
of  them,  we  can  indeed  have  a  guiding  course 
of action at hand.  This course of action begins 
with  the  need  for  collective  thoughtfulness  and 
consensus  opening  the  doors  to  new  initiatives 
and alliances.

I  hereby  express  my  thanks  to  the  Mayor,  Mr. 
José Isabel Blandón, the Vice Mayor, Ms. Raisa 
Banfield, all the directors and officials of the Dis-
trict of Panama and of San Miguelito District, as 
well as to the community leaders, entities and of-
ficials forming part of the central government, the 
academy, NGOs and the international organiza-
tions  for  all  the  collaborative  support  they  have 
provided to make this Strategy come true.

We are presenting a Strategy with working guide-
lines  that  address  various  initiatives  concerning 
transportation,  education  and  basic  needs,  an 
insight into our environment, the appreciation of 
ecosystems, a green infrastructure, a positive ap-
proach  to  prepare  ourselves  for  the  risks  ahead, 
the  enhancement  of  governance  processes,  citi-
zen  participation  and  everybody’s  responsibility 
for all the people to have and enjoy the same in-
dividual and collective rights within a supportive 
society.

I also wish to thank all the team of the 100 Resil-
ient Cities Program for their support in the devel-
opment and making of this Strategy.  It has been 
an  extraordinary  experience  of  joint,  direct  and 
coordinated work with novel ideas and insights.  
This  has  allowed  us  to  envision  change  for  our 
city and thus set an example for the other cities. 
In 10 years’ time, this city must be one which will, 
regardless of any barriers ahead, share a vision of 
growth based on an environment full of life, food, 
water, and biodiversity.

All in all, we are what we do to 

change what we are

RESILIENT PANAMAExecutive 
Summary 

T

the City of Panama has been a strate-
gic route for maritime and trans-isth-
mic  transit  ever  since  the  sixteenth 
century  until  today.  Its  geopolitical 
wealth  has  boosted  cultural,  commercial  and 
technological exchange across the world. Panama 

City has also been the seat of interna-
tional transactions for business, bank-
ing  and  tourism,  the  trade  of  various 
goods, besides having played a major 
role in the route of spices, silver, silk, 
porcelain and gold. 
 
The  consolidation  of  the  role 
played by Panama City as a connec-
tion platform for the drivers of world 
development  took  place  during  the 
construction  of  the  inter-oceanic  ca-
nal.  With the growth of its population, 
Panama City evolved  and expanded. 
In  1907,  new  villages  emerged  along 
the  present  boundary of  the  protect-
ed area within the canal’s basin, and a trans-isth-
mic  highway  was  also  built,  which  provided 
ground  communication  from  the  Pacific  Ocean 
to the Caribbean. This would be the last stand-
ing  connection  stronghold  of  the  north-south 
route  along  which  Panama’s  railway  would  run.  

STRATEGY PILLARS

1  Access to opportunities  

By connecting human capital with 
welfare sources  
It includes projects related to the 
educational needs of Panamanian 
children and youngsters; 
the Government staff, the 
development of human capital 
and promoting accessibility and 
connectivity of citizens by means 
of various transportation systems. 
With the projects proposed, we 
aspire to: 

1.1. 

1.2. 

 Foster a better quality of life 
based on more integrated mobil-
ity. 
  Enhance human capital so 
as to improve access to job 
opportunities

2   Infrastructure  

in neighborhoods  
By making a city for everyone 
It consists of making territorial 
investments in projects making 
everyone form an integral part 
of Panama City. It encompasses 
projects seeking to meet the 
needs for infrastructure in order 
to integrate the most isolated 
communities while seeking to 
integrate informal slums as well. 
With the projects proposed, we 
aspire to: 

2.1. 

 Drive the integration of com-
munities through a broader and 
better social infrastructure.

2.2.   Connect the population through 

a new basic infrastructure. 

Two  additional  development  hubs  were  estab-
lished, which allowed Panama City to be connect-
ed from East to West by means of the Pan-Amer-
ican  highway.  With  this  growing  connectivity, 
both  formal  and  informal  settlements  forming 
part of the urban pattern began to compete with 
the  ecosystems,  thus  creating  vulnerable  areas 
from  the  environmental,  social,  and  economic 
point of view for the present population. In par-
allel,  the  growing  inequality  also  simultaneously 
gave rise to two cities that enjoyed two different 
sets of rights and opportunities. 
 
In the face of these new challenges, urbaniza-
tion  opportunities  and  incentives  for  the  auton-
omy  of  democratic  local  Governments,  Panama 
City’s administration begins a process consisting 
of the decentralization of the roles of the Pana-
manian  State,  thus  acquiring  governance  and 
competence  at  a  local  level  for  many  of  the  ar-
eas formerly governed from the national sphere. 
Thus,  the city  becomes  liable  for  responding to 

the  needs  of  its  citizens.  The  city  is  increasing-
ly endowed with the necessary tools that allow it 
to  create  policies,  plans,  programs,  and  projects 
intended to strengthen the stresses adoption and 
incorporation of a resilience vision that includes, 
not only the shocks, but also the  that undermine 
its structure and functioning. 
  Panama City  is one of  the cities  included  in 
the  100  Resilient  Cities  Program  of  the  Rocke-
feller Foundation, which is currently developing 
and  implementing  a  Resilience  Strategy.  The 
strategy-making process consisted of a diagnosis 
of the city’s vulnerabilities, as well as surveys and 
analyses of such issues and the outlining of actions 
contributing to the construction of the city’s resil-
ience. This information was compiled and orga-
nized in 5 pillars, 11 goals and 45 actions that form 
an integral part of this resilience strategy.    

3   Rediscovering our 

 

wetland city By coexisting 
in a better way with our own 
waters and environment
   It includes projects intended to 
understand the environment where 
Panamanians live, to improve the 
relationship citizens have with 
water and water ecosystems, the 
management thereof and the miti-
gation of climate change. With the 
projects proposed, we aspire to:

3.1. 

 Rethink the infrastructure that 
will protect us from the effects 
of climate change

3.2.   Effectively communicate the 
value of water as a resource 
and that of the ecosystems 
protecting us. 

3.3.   Integrating and modernizing 

water coordination and 
management instruments and 
ecosystems.

4   Integral management  

of risk

RESILIENT PANAMAUrban  
Resilience 

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF 
URBAN RESILIENCE

T

he  term  “urban  resilience”  has  been 
defined  by  the  100  Resilient  Cities 
program (100RC) as the capacity of 
individuals,  communities, 
institu-
tions,  companies  and  systems  coexisting  in  any 
one city to survive, adapt and grow regardless of 
any shocks and stresses that may take place with-
in  their  environment.  Thus,  resilience  may  be 
seen  as  the capacity of  a city’s  systems  to  keep 
their  effectiveness  and  functioning  when  adapt-
ing in the face of any given problem. 
 
100RC  promotes  the  use  of  a  Conceptual 
Framework of Urban Resilience as a way of de-
scribing  the  areas  where  cities  must  take  action 
in order to become more resilient. This is an evi-
dence-based tool that allows cities to bring their 
challenges,  opportunities  and  actions  together 
from a resilient viewpoint. 
  The Resilience Framework is composed of 4 di-
mensions, 12 components, and 50 subcomponents 
helping  to  articulate  the  capabilities  of  the  city’s 
processes for the building of resilience. These pro-
vide a common language that allows cities to share 
both their knowledge and experience.

RESILIENT PANAMARESILIENCE QUALITIES

Both thoughtfulness and ingeniousness characterize the systems that have managed to learn from their past and 
to act in an innovative way in times of hardship. Robustness, redundancy and flexibility help to conceive systems 
and assets that may withstand shocks and stresses, as well as the willingness to implement alternative strategies 
to make rapid recovery easier. Inclusive and integrated systems are associated with the processes of good gover-
nance and effective leadership. These guarantee adequate investments and actions intended to meet the needs of 
vulnerable groups and collective capability for creating a resilient city for everyone.

100 Resilient 
Cities Program

 FLEXIBILITY. This is the willingness and abil-
ity to adopt alternative strategies in response 
to changing circumstances or sudden crises. 
Systems can be made flexible through intro-
duction of new technologies or know-how, 
including recognition of traditional practices.

INCLUSIVENESS. This highlights the need 
to make broad consultation and take into 
account different standpoints in order to gen-
erate a sense of shared ownership and a joint 
vision for the city. 

INTEGRATION. This links players from both 
public and private entities, which yields 
additional benefits, resources are thus shared 
and encourages such players to be able 
to work collaboratively to achieve better 
results.

REFLECTIVITY. This emphasizes the impor-
tance that both citizens and their leaders 
should use their past experiences to make 
decisions and modify their standards and 
behaviors based on their lessons learned. For 
example, sensible planning processes are ca-
pable of being more responsive to changing 
circumstances.

RESOURCEFULNESS. It means the capacity 
to identify alternative methods to use re-
sources in times of hardship, with the aim to 
cater for shortages and achieve goals. 

ROBUSTNESS. A robust design is one which 
has been properly conceived, built and man-
aged, including provisions to make sure that 
any failures may be foreseeable, safe and 
proportionate in relation to their causes.

REDUNDANCY. This is the additional capac-
ity that is deliberately created to prevent 
any possible disruptions due to external 
pressures, sudden overloads of demand or 
disorders triggered by external causes. This 
includes diversity, should there exist several 
ways to satisfy any given need.

WHAT IS THE 100 RESILIENT CITIES 
PROGRAM? 

T

he  City  of  Panama  was  selected  in 
2016  to  take  part  in  the  100  Resil-
ient  Cities  Program  (100RC)  of  the 
Rockefeller  Foundation.  It  is  the 
only  city  in  Central  America  that  forms  part  of 
the program and will serve as a role model for oth-
er cities across the region in the development of 
actions within the resilience framework.

100RC  focuses  on  supporting  cities  in  their 
adoption and incorporation of a resilience vision 
including  not  only  acute  shocks,  whether  trig-
gered  by  natural  disasters  or  caused  by  the  ac-
tion of man, such as earthquakes, floods, disease 
outbreaks, terrorist attacks, but also any stresses 
posed in the day-to-day challenges a city needs 
to deal with, such as the obsolescence of its infra-
structure or unemployment.

All the cities in the 100RC network receive the 
following resources: 

1.  Funding  to  hire  a  Resilience  Di-
rector  (or  Chief  Resilience  Officer, 
CRO), who acts as an advisor to the 
city’s mayor or vice-mayor and oper-
ational divisions by adopting a coordi-
nating approach. He will be responsi-
ble for coordinating and implementing 
the initiatives of the strategy.

2. Access to experience, technical as-
sistance and analytical tools to support 
the development and implementation 
of an appropriate strategy for the city, 
guidance  in  analysis  design,  work 
plans  and  direct  strategic  training  for  the  city’s 
team. The city also has access to funding for con-
sultancies to respond to specific questions about 
the findings discussed in a Preliminary Resilience 
Analysis, with a network of international and na-
tional specialists.

3.  Contribution  of  pro-bono  services  from  the 
“platform partners” composed of selective mem-
bers  from  the  private,  public,  academic  and 
non-profit sectors. The partners offered services 
for the construction of resilience, including spe-
cialized analyses and support for the application 
of innovative ideas reflecting on the actions com-
posing the strategy.

4. The 100RC network is formed by Resilience 
Directors from all the member cities. This is a dy-
namic group of leaders who provide collaborative 
work to the field of urban resilience professionals. 
The  network  makes  it  possible  to  share  knowl-
edge  and  collaboration  among  colleagues  from 
the cities involved both during and after the strat-
egy-making  process.  Through  this  membership, 
100RC  does  not  only  help  Panama  City  to  be 
more resilient, but it also facilitates the creation 
of a global resilience development practice in the 
short, medium and long term.

Panama City

With the identification of oppor-
tunities and outlining of actions to 
be developed in the strategy, the 
implementation process begins 
with the identification of strategic 
alliances and funding both at the 
local and international level.

The issues identified in phase 1 
are delved into by means of a 
process engaging both players 
and teams from the city, platform 
partners and other cities in the 
network. Actions, working teams 
and partnerships with new players 
are proposed so that they can add 
up to and validate the process of 
building the city’s resilience. This 
phase concludes with the publica-
tion of the Resilience Strategy.

This consists of a comprehensive 
preliminary diagnosis of the city, 
which contains an identification of 
the areas in which the city needs 
to make better efforts to build a 
resilient city. Additionally, a sup-
port group with the Local Gov-
ernment is created. Likewise, the 
key players for development and 
successful implementation of the 
strategy are identified.

Based on the shocks and stresses 
thus identified in the diagnosis, 
the strategy then seeks to spot 
specific actions taken by the local 
Government and other players 
involved, tries to complete them 
and suggest any new ones, thus 
consolidating a work plan.

RESILIENT PANAMATools and 
Methodology

T

he  process  of  creating  the  strategy 
has  a  comprehensive  and  holistic 
approach.  Engagement  of  players 
from various sectors prevails, such as 
groups  of  academic  experts,  (national  and  local) 
Government, civil society and the private sector 
by means of interviews, workshops, meetings and 
focus groups. In parallel, a thorough review of sec-
ondary information and research studies, review of 
laws, public policies and strategic plans, is carried 
out. Both the 100RC platform partners and con-
sultants  come  together,  thus  creating  inputs  and 
identifying  opportunities  and  recommendations 

that are then included in the resilience 
strategy. 
 
Following  the  strategy  devel-
opment  process  and  a  review  of  ex-
isting  data,  interviews,  inventory  of 
resilience  actions  and  insights,  key 
issues  to  understand  about  Panama 
City, such as: equity, social cohesion, 
water  resource  management,  climate 
change,  physical  vulnerabilities,  gov-
ernance and municipal administration 
are identified. 
 
In  order  to  delve  into  under-
standing  key  issues  identified  at  the 
beginning,  some  theme-based  working  groups 
were  formed  with  members  from  the  various 
sectors  involved.  Once  these  groups  have  been 
formed, the methodology of each was defined by 
conducting  reviews  of  laws,  public  policies,  stra-
tegic  plans,  technical  surveys,  mappings  of  play-
ers, consultations with experts, close linkages with 
100RC  platform  partners  and  other  researchers. 
The activities performed also included workshops, 
working round tables and interviews. The inputs 
from the various players involved are then written 
down in this strategy.

Later, in 1513, when the Spaniards led 
by Vasco Nunez de Balboa got to see 
the so-called South Sea (Pacific Ocean), 
he confirmed that they were at an 
isthmus. The presence of this unknown 
ocean required an advanced position to 
be founded to conquest and control the 
newly-discovered lands. In response 
to this need, Pedrarias Davila founded 
the city of Our Lady of the Assumption 
of Panama in 1519, the first port city in 
the South Sea. Panama City cemented 
its great importance as a terminal and 
connection hub for the various routes 
of the Spanish empire for trade, trans-
portation of passengers and military 
strategic defense. Even after the end 
of the Spanish colonial period, Pana-
ma has remained relevant as a logistic 
hub by playing its permanent role as a 
connection and destination enclave for 
business routes worldwide. For all these 
reasons, it has consolidated itself as a 
World Heritage Site, with the property 
entitled “Archeological Site of Panama 
Viejo and Historic District of Panama” 
(Osorio-Ugarte, 2012; UNESCO, 2017). 
The river Chagres in particular played 
a vital role in the establishment of the 
transportation network through the 
isthmus and in its military defense (Old 
School Panama, 2014).

The Isthmus of Panama became inde-
pendent from Spain in 1821 and volun-
tarily joined Greater Colombia in 1822. 
The first transcontinental railway was 
inaugurated in Panama in 1855, which 
was a technological leap forward with 
significant effects on the local econo-
my as it grew more efficient than the 
Camino de Cruces, which was the route 
connecting the Pacific with the Atlan-
tic Ocean along the river Chagres. The 
following logistical advance of world-
wide relevance was the construction of 
the Interoceanic Canal of Panama. This 
work was started by the French and 
completed by the Americans, after the 
separation of Panama from Colombia 
on November 3, 1903.

Construction of the Canal of Panama 
guaranteed the U.S.A. full jurisdiction 
over the Canal Zone created in 1904 
and broad sovereign powers. Thus, the 
United States leveraged the potential 
of the geographic and geopolitical 
importance of the Isthmus of Pana-
ma in the Latin American region, and 
its long occupation lasted until the 
administration of the Canal of Panama 
and its surrounding stretches of land 
(military bases still remaining there) in 
1999 after the execution of the Panama 
Canal Treaty in 1977 whereby it was 
transferred to Panama. The Basin of the 
Panama Canal provides water supply 
for human consumption in the towns lo-
cated in the interoceanic region, and it 
is fundamental for the supply of water 
to the cities of Panama and Colon.
 
a military regime ruling the country 
which launched agrarian reform and 
peasant settlement programs that 
finally penetrated into the urban basins 
of the metropolitan region of Panama. 
The military regime collapsed with the 
overthrow of general Manuel Antonio 
Noriega after the invasion conducted 
by the United States in 1981. The 
invasion is thought to have caused 
a highly significant psychological 
shock on the population, which has 
not been served in furtherance of a 
nationwide reconciliation. In the wake 
of dismemberment of the political 
vision under the military regimen, 
there ensued a restructuring of the 

From 1968 through 1989, there was 

balance of partisan political power, and 
twenty-nine years after the collapse 
of such regime, citizens still perceive 
that corruption levels have increased 
(Beluche, 2004). Much of the revenues 
of the Republic as a whole and of its 
capital city come from the Canal of 
Panama, which has yielded net profits 
amounting to US$ 2.886 billion in 
2017 from tolls, electric power supply, 
logistics and water supply. Out of those 
proceeds, US$ 1.65 billion was paid to 
the State by way of taxes (La Prensa 
journal, 2018). The Panama Canal’s 
GDP is projected to account for 2.2% 
to 2.5% of the country’s GDP for 2018 
(Gonzalez-Jimenes, 2017). Nevertheless, 
Panama City hosts some other economic 
activities, such as international banking 
and shopping tourism, especially due 
to the presence of a duty-free zone and 
its connectivity by ground and air with 
Central and South America. The city also 
plays an important role in the marketing 
and supply chain of fishery products, 
for it has several ports and is located at 
an area of high fishing productivity. The 
city has a coastline outcrop entailing a 
significant concentration of nutrients 
which bring about a broad availability 
and large density of maritime species 
of nutritional importance. Another 
important activity is port logistics, 
since it has large areas of containers 
surrounding the Canal of Panama. 
Likewise, Panama City functions as an 
air logistics center, both for passenger 
and freight flights.

Banking  Board  of  Panama,  2018). 
Both  banks  and  institutions  related 
to  the  International  Banking  Center 
settled  down  along  Via  España  and 
Calle  50,  two  of  the  major  streets  in 
Panama City. 
 
During  the  same  period,  San 
Miguelito became an area of informal 
slums  for  migrants  to  the  city  who 
came from other regions in the coun-
try and it was designated as a Special 
District  separated  from  the  Munici-
pality of Panama, inserted at the cen-
ter of the Metropolitan Area.

T

he history of the city is closely related 
to migrations that have led to a very 
diverse  ethnographic  and  economic 
composition  of  the  population.  The 
manpower  employed  for  the  construction  of  the 
interoceanic railway between 1850 and 1855, and 
the Interoceanic Canal between 1906 and 1914, of-
fered opportunities for migration to Panama City. 
After the creation of the Panama Canal Zone in 
1904,  the  urban  area  grew  towards  the  east,  the 
direction that the city is still growing today. Af-
ter  the  elimination  of  the  Canal  Zone  in  1979, 
Panama  City  started  a  process  of  development 
northwards, along the trans-isthmic highway, and 
another development westwards, thus transform-
ing a substantial part of the cities of Arraijan and 
La Chorrera into “bedroom areas” where many of 
their inhabitants commute to work in the districts 
of Panama and San Miguelito (Castro, 2006).
 
“The Banking Act of 1970 was conceived with 
a spirit oriented to promote and attract the physical 
presence of new and prestigious international banks 
from  all  over  the  world.  Panama’s  comparative 
advantages  afforded  unique  conditions  for  the 
creation  and  development  of  an  International 
Banking Center specialized in foreign transactions 
and  a  modern  telecommunications  center  that 
would  allow  our  country  to  focus  on  processing 
countless international financial transactions and a 
U.S.  dollar-based  currency  system”  (Supervisory 

WATER CONNECTION 
Built at the narrowest part of Panama, by leverag-
ing the course of river Chagres, is the Panama Ca-
nal, which began operations in 1914 and accounts 
for 4% of Panama’s national territory.
  The  river Chagres  was chosen  as  a  major  af-
fluent for the canal due to its historic rises, which 
took  place  ever  since  c.  1870.  One  example  was 
the  rise  of  1880,  where  the  river  reached  a  flow 
volume  of  2.266  cubic  meters  per  second,  thus 
increasing by eight times its average flow volume 
during the rainy season (Osorio-Ugarte, 2014). 
  Before the construction of the canal, the river 
Chagres used to drain towards the Atlantic along 
the mountain chain. The construction of the canal 
involved detonating the nearby mountain chain to 
create the access through locks and sluicegates for 
ships and vessels towards the Pacific. This geolog-
ic cut shortened the flood plain of the rises of river 
Chagres,  both  in  distance  and  depth,  confining 
them to the area nearby Lake Alhajuela. Alhajue-
la is an artificial lake withholding the flow volume 
of  river  Chagres  for  its  regulation  and  later  use, 
as a source of water to transport vessels from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific and as a source of potable 
water supply for at least two million inhabitants, 
which is equivalent to half the population of the 
Republic of Panama (Osorio-Ugarte, 2014).

RESILIENT PANAMACITY CONTEXT  The water resource in Panama impacts the ca-
nal’s protected areas and basins in the city, which 
form part of the capital city, as are the basins of Riv-
er Abajo, River Matasnillo, River Juan Diaz, River 
Matias  Hernandez,  River  Curundu,  River  Tocu-
men, River Tapia, River Pacora, among others.   
  The basins intertwine with a mountainous sys-
tem  separate  from  the  Central  Mountain  Chain 
towards the north of the coastline strip occupied 
by  a  humid  rain  forest  with  a  rich  biodiversity. 
Protected  national  parks  form  an  integral  part 
thereof, including the Metropolitan Natural Park 
at  the  center  of  the  city,  Sovereignty  National 
Park, Camino de Cruces National Park, and An-
con  Hill.  These  hydrological,  geographical  and 
urban  conditions  result  in  a  complex  interaction 
between humans and the native flora and fauna of 
protected areas surrounding the city. Its connec-
tivity provides the city with a landscape resource. 

ECOSYSTEMS AND URBAN PATTERN
The growth of Panama’s urban pattern has been 
partly dictated by the changes occurring in water 
ecosystems. During the construction of the canal, 
the nearby towns surrounding the River Chagres 
were flooded, where the majority of the national 
and  foreign  workers employed  in  the canal  were 
living.  This  caused  new  towns,  which  later  be-
came home to such workers, to emerge. 
  The  areas  closer  to  the  coastline  have  been 
subject to urban development built on flood zones 
with  predominant  wetland  plains,  a  network  of 
various  tributaries  and  on  areas  near  various  hy-
drographic basins.
  The  Panama Canal  kept  an  indirect  relation-
ship with Panama City, which isolated it from the 
rest of the country, by constraining its growth di-
recting it along the strip running between the Ca-
nal Zone and the sea towards the east. This pres-
sure  caused  much  of  the  population  to  settle  on 
high  risk  zones.  The  disappearance  of  the  Zone 
as determined in the Canal Treaty of 1977 made 
it possible for the city to expand towards the west

“Informal housing” means any home 
built in violation of the urbanization 
and construction rules currently in 
force; rapidly at the beginning, in an 
improvised way and with second-
hand materials, and on lands which 
are not legally owned by their 
occupants. 

 “Social housing”  are those located 
in neighborhoods originated from 
a state-run housing project. It may 
consist of served plots of land, basis 
units, finished houses or apartments 
built by the State, which sold it to 
their occupants.

“Formal housing” refers to homes 
located in neighborhoods originally 
built by private companies or individ-
uals, by following currently applica-
ble urban development and building 
regulations. The development would 
also occur in plots of land with the 
necessary authorization for such pur-
poses, and having the minimum  
urban services (potable water, 
sewage and storm-water drainage 
system, and electric wiring).

coastline of the canal and, especially, northwards. 
So  far,  this  expansion  has  taken  place  without 
a  vision  focused  on  the  conservation  of  green 
areas.  Even  so,  national  parks  are  kept  in  good 
condition, however, they are under high levels of 
threat, such as the felling of woods, hunting and 
mining, among others. 
  The changes in the urban pattern are correlat-
ed with a growth of urban areas towards the east 
and  the  north.  Middle-class  Panamanians  have 
been  settling  down  in  neighborhoods  of  houses 
and massive housing complexes, which have lit-
tle recreation space and reduced green areas and 
experience an isolation of transportation systems 
and  employment  and  educational  opportunities. 
These neighborhoods are located in areas adjoin-
ing  extreme  poverty  zones  where  many  people 
settled illegally, thus creating a marked inequality 
problem and big difficulty for the Government to 
accomplish the supply of basic utilities. The priv-
ilege of residing on the seaside has spurred con-
struction of tall buildings on vulnerable coastline 
zones, thus increasing risks for people who live in 
sea-level neighborhoods. This has contributed to 
deterioration of wetlands at Panama Bay towards 

the east, where middle- and lower-class neighbor-
hoods are adjoining large real estate projects, and 
golf courses built on sanitary landfills raised above 
six meters high. This difference in elevation has 
increased  the  risks  of  flooding  in  nearby  neigh-
borhoods built below sea level. Additionally, the 
removal of wetlands to keep expanding the city 
has also impacted fishing productivity.

TOWARDS A LOCAL GOVERNANCE
In spite of the challenges and problems accrued from 
the past, the country has taken on a new direction 
towards  strengthening  of  Local  Governments 
through  the  enforcement  of  the  Municipal 
Decentralization  Act.  This  law  was  enacted  in 
2006  and  became  effective  in  2014  under  the 
leadership  of  the  Municipality  of  Panama.  New 
operating divisions were created, including those 
of Urban Planning, Environmental Management, 
Citizenship  Participation  and  Transparency, 
and Culture and Education, among others. The 
Social  Management  Division  was  strengthened 
and the Resilience Division was created in 2017. 
International  organizations  have  also  invested 
resources  targeted  at  taking  sustainable  urban 
development  actions,  for  instance,  with  the 
Action Plan entitled “Metropolitan, Human and 
Global Panama” in 2015. This survey is of utmost 
importance as it involves a joint effort made by the 
Mayor’s Office of Panama City and the initiative 
Emerging and Sustainable Cities (ICES, as per its 
official acronym in Spanish) of the Interamerican 
Development Bank (Scodelaro et al, 2015). The 
study  uses  technical  and  statistical  analyses  to 
arrive to the diagnosis of the city’s current situation 
and has supports sustainable and comprehensive 
planning. This study also includes strategic lines 
of  analysis,  such  as  mobility  and  transportation, 
urban inequality and use of soil, vulnerability to 
natural disasters, water management, cleanup and 
drainage, solid waste disposal and modernization 
of municipal management. 
  On the other hand, the Comprehensive Plan 

29

RESILIENT PANAMACITY CONTEXTfor Sustainable Urban Mobility (PIMUS, as per 
its official acronym in Spanish) is a planning tool 
that  defines  mobility  policies  and  programs  re-
quired by Panama’s metropolitan area in the next 
30  years  to  come.  In  2018,  the  making  of  the 
Land Use Plan (POT), as per its official acronym 
in Spanish) began, which is the core initiative to 
finally provide the Municipality of Panama with 
the jurisdictional competences of local urban de-
velopment  authority.  The  development  of  the 
Resilience  Strategy  is  currently  aligned  with 
the  definition  of  the  strategic  lines  of  said  plan. 
The plan will include participatory construction 
of a sustainable growth model and formulate the 
drafting  of  the  Legal  Instrument  of  Territorial 
Ordering  and  Management  by  means  of  public 
consultations and coordination with national and 
regional  plans.  Additionally,  a  proposal  will  be 
made for legal support of the project portfolio and 
execution of training and publicity activities with-
in the framework of this plan. 

 
In  addition  to  this,  the  Municipality  of  Pan-
ama  is  already  working  on  implementation  of 
the  Eco-Protocol,  which  consists  of  developing 
a system of green buildings to evaluate the envi-
ronmental  impact  and  performance  of  existing 
buildings. It will provide a comprehensive frame-
work  that  will  give  necessary  input  to  assess  the 
overall  environmental  performance  of  the  build-
ings  located  in  Panama.  The  assessment  criteria 
of  the  Eco-Protocol  evaluate  social  connectivity, 
the existing infrastructure and management of the 
site, energy-efficiency and conservation, water-ef-
ficiency  and  conservation,  organizational  aware-
ness, procurement and operations, quality of inner 
air, waste disposal and recycling, calculation of the 
CO2 reduction, among other green and innovative 
features. The evaluation process aims to verify rel-
evant  reports  and  pieces  of  evidence  so  that  the 
building complies with the intent pursued by those 
criteria, the minimum performance of the chapter 
and the expected standard of certification.

 

Native peoples in Panama City

Panama City hosts the ethnic group Embera-Wounaan along the 
Curundu neighborhood, Lake Alajuela in Chilibre and Pacora; the Ngabe-
Bugle concentrate in the neighborhood Pacora (Las Garzas) and 24 
de Diciembre. The Gunas have mainly settled down in the villages of 
Calidonia, Santa Ana, and Ancón, with the latter containing Kuna Nega, 
a neighborhood nearby Patacon Hill, which is the garbage dump of the 
province of Panama. 

Migrants for the World Bridge

Between 1904 and 1913, some 56,944 people worked 
on the construction of the Panama Canal, of whom 
11,873 came from Europe, 31,071 from the Antilles; 
11,000 from the United States; 3,000 Chinese and 
some more from other unidentified places. Around 
27,000 workers died, mainly from malaria and yellow 
fever. The accidental deaths occurred in relation to 
the failed French project resulted in a total of at least 
22,000 and more than 5,000 in the works performed 
by the United States. The Afro-Antillean population 
who continued their lives in the metropolitan area 
settled down in neighborhoods such as Santa Ana, el 
Chorrillo, El Marañon, Curundu and River Abajo.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE  

RESILIENCE STRATEGY

RESILIENT PANAMAinsights 

For  a  better  understanding  of  these 
issues,  such  evaluation  was  complet-
ed  with  an  online  survey  of  489  re-
spondents  that  helped  the  team  to 
determine 
into  resilience. 
Likewise,  the  actions  posed  by  the 
Action Plan for Metropolitan Panama 
were  discussed:  Sustainable,  Human 
and  Global  (IDB,  2015).  The  117  in-
dicators  included  in  the  Action  Plan 
were  compared  with  the  Conceptual 
Resilience Framework so that the rela-
tionship between both methodologies 
could  be  understood.  All  these  ele-
ments were collated with the Conceptual Resil-
ience Framework provided by 100RC.
  This phase closed with the call for a Municipal 
Technical  Board  attended  by  15  members,  who 
gave their support to the Preliminary Resilience 
Analysis, which identified five “discovery areas”, 
namely: equity, social cohesion, management of 
water resources, physical vulnerabilities and mu-
nicipal governance. These “discovery areas” serve 
as  core  ideas  to  guide  research  work  conducted 
during the second phase of strategy development. 
A work plan based on these areas was drawn up 
by  taking  into  account  the  respective  questions 
posed  in  the  Preliminary  Resilience  Analysis.  

Methodological 
Process of 
Panama’s 
Strategy

T

he  strategy  development  process 
began with a workshop organized in 
2016 by the Municipality of Panama, 
jointly with 100 Resilient Cities. The 
objective  of  the  workshop  was  to  publicize  the 
concept of urban resilience and to identify on a 
preliminary  basis  the  shocks  and  stresses  facing 
the city. This workshop was attended by various 
officials of the Municipality, community leaders, 
civil  and  academic  organizations,  businessper-
sons,  100RC  program  representatives,  and  resil-
ience  directors  from  other  cities  involved  in  the 
network. 
  For  phase  1,  a  Preliminary  Resilience  Anal-
ysis  was  conducted,  consisting  of  a  preliminary 
diagnosis of the city’s threats, from May through 
November 2017, which was complemented with 
a total tally of 104 participants in 52 interviews, 
2 workshops, 4 forums (Dominici-Arosemena et 
al  2017).  During  this  first  phase,  several  players 
and specialists were involved from fields such as 
economics, urban, environmental and social plan-
ning;  central-  and  municipal-level  governance 
topics (specialists from the District of Panama and 
San Miguelito District) as well as some academic 
representatives, NGOs and the private sector. 

In order to answer these questions, 25 interviews 
in  person  were  conducted  and  6  meetings  were 
held with working groups of experts concerning 
various discovery areas, which were attended by 
111 people. Also, 6 community workshops were 
conducted  in  6  neighborhoods  (such  as  Alcal-
de  Diaz,  Ernesto  Cordoba,  Pedregal,  Tocumen, 
Pacora and in the community of the predominant 
ethnic group Guna based in the neighborhood of 
Kuna Nega located in the neighborhood of An-
con)  with  the  participation  of  129  community 
leaders. Similarly, two synthesis workshops were 
made,  which  were  coordinated  jointly  with  the 
100 Resilient Cities Program and with presenta-
tions delivered by both consultants and partners 
of the 100RC Platform. Additionally, a workshop 
about  topics  concerned  with  infrastructure,  wa-

ter, ecosystems, and risk management, was con-
ducted with the attendance of 30 experts; and an-
other workshop on the topics of equity, economy, 
transportation  and  social  cohesion,  with  18  ex-
perts who took part in it. Finally, a call was made 
to the Municipal Technical Resilience Board at-
tended by 20 participants, who gave their recom-
mendations, feedback and ideas for programs and 
projects for the Resilience Strategy. The findings 
of these workshops, besides identification of op-
portunities  based  on  the  various  reports  quoted 
in this strategy, gave rise to the project portfolio 
found in this document.

Equity as a driver for a 
better quality of life

Informal and mostly disconnected slums are in 
turn areas where poverty levels increase and 
there is less availability of services.

There is an important relationship between the 
satisfaction of basic need and social indicators 
such as discrimination, economic prosperity and 
access to reliable communication and mobility.

Cohesion as a trigger for a 
better quality of life

Management of the water 
resource as a factor making 
a city safer

Understanding of physical 
vulnerabilities as a basis 
for a safer city

Governance is an essential 
step for resilience

The cohesion of communities and the need to foster 
integration and to diminish discrimination against members 
of various communities, is an important step to defining 
better policies for municipalities and the promotion of human 
rights in the metropolitan area. 

It is necessary to raise 
awareness among the Pan-
amanian population of the 
water cycle, even though 
Panama is a city enclosed 
within a network of basins 
with great variation and dy-
namism in the coastline zone.

Contamination of rivers and 
the coastline zone suggests 
that the water resource 
is not given enough 
importance.

There is high use of water, 
and there are high leakage 
of it due to system fail-
ures. Water supply does 
not reach all sectors of the 
population and lacks the 
necessary infrastructure for 
management and reuse of 
residual waters.

Recurring floods suggest that these are 
perceived as an important stress, triggered 
by failures in the basic infrastructure and a 
historic shortage of integrated long term 
planning, as well as the failure to comply 
with building codes and regulations, thereby 
disregarding climate change. 

Building and urban development codes 
are very closely related to the need to 
understand physical vulnerabilities in the 
face of possible shocks, such as the risks of 
earthquakes, tsunamis and landslides.

Streamlining of administrative and budget planning 
processes would have an impact on the city’s economic 
prosperity, leadership promotion and effective management; 
as well as in social stability, safety and justice to prevent 
corruption, thus strengthening the functioning and 
effectiveness of municipalities and its various divisions.

RESILIENT PANAMADEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE STRATEGYS

hocks  are  generally  catastrophic 
events, such as: fires, earthquakes and 
floods. Stresses are factors that exert 
a  frequent  or  recurrent  pressure  on 
the  city,  e.g.  chronic  shortage  of  food  or  water, 
an  overloaded  transportation  system,  or  high 
unemployment. Every city has shocks and stresses 
with  different  levels  of  incidence,  this  is  why  it 
is  critical  for  Panama  City  to  be  well  informed 
about its current situation with the aim to address 
priority issues that may impair its functioning and 
development.

SHOCKS TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Panama City’s geographic position (an inter-trop-
ical convergence zone) is characterized by heavy 

rains during the rainy season running from May 
through December. This season brings about on-
going  floods  affecting  the  lowest  coastal  zones. 
Recent  studies  suggest  that  floods  tend  to  con-
centrate in the areas where the basins have been 
canalized and cemented (Scodelaro et al, 2015).
 
In the past, Panama City suffered from large-
scale  earthquakes.  In  1621,  the  largest  ever-re-
corded earthquake occurred, with a Richter-scale 
magnitude of 7. In 1882 there was another seism 
of magnitude 7.9 and the last one took place in 
1971  with  a  magnitude  of  5.6.  After  the  latest 
one, there have been no other earthquakes that 
have caused serious damages in the infrastructure; 
however, recent research suggests that there are 
some  active  faults  in  the  region  (Bennett  et  al, 
2014; Rockwell et al, 2010) with enough potential 
to cause earthquakes.

 Landslides in Nuevo Veranillo

Heavy rains bring about floods. The 
most disastrous one in the last 10 years 
took place in September 2004. It affected 
12,986 people, 2,770 houses and left a tally 
of 13 casualties (IDB, 2015). 

Landslides often occur (especially in the district 
of San Miguelito) due to buildings made without 
ordering, which would bring about situations that are 
hard to control and could hinder the movement of 
people (Serracan, 2002). 

There have been earthquakes of great 
magnitude in Panama in 1621 (of magnitude 7 in the 
Richter scale), in 1882 (magnitude 7.9) and in 1971 (of 
magnitude 5.6). The risk of earthquakes is higher than 
residents estimate, taking into account the results of 
recent research studies that suggest the existence of 
active faults in the region (Bennett et al, 2014; Rock-
well et al, 2010).

Impact of the 1882 earthquake on 
the works of the Panama Canal

Strong winds affect houses of 
poor constructive quality, typical in 
these areas, with tile roofs and light 
enclosures that end up contributing to 
the destructive effect of the blowing 
wind (IDB, 2015).

Risks of tsunamis associated with seismic 
activity in the Pacific Ocean, or the fire belt (Rosen-
berg, 2017), endanger the buildings still under 
development in danger zones along the coastline 
of the cities located across this region. The most 
relevant case has been the tsunami of San Juan del 
Sur, Nicaragua, in 1992, with 170 casualties (INETER, 
2005). Strategic sites have been established to per-
form drills mobilizing people with the corresponding 
signage of places to go after receiving notice of 
evacuation (AMP, 2016). 

The overall poverty level 
in the district of Panama is 13% 
(147,519 people) and in San Miguelito, 
it reaches 12.7% (44,135 people). The 
levels of extreme poverty amount to 
2.5% (29,590 people) and 2.4% (8,408 
people), respectively (MEF, 2017). 
Poverty increases in peripheral areas 
to the north and east,  
which are rural in nature.

Murder rates for every 10,000 
inhabitants amounted to 252 deaths in 
the district of Panama in 2014, and to 
106 in San Miguelito (SIEC, 2014).

Racial and social 
discrimination in the 
Panamanian society was fueled by the 
canal-related military enclave. Afro-
descendents, Asians and  indigenous 
persons were (and still are) driven 
towards the poorest neighborhoods, 
and pushed to the lowest-paid jobs.

Poor disposal of solid 
waste impairs the population’s 
health, blocks drainage pipes and 
results in an increase of floods 
(Thompson, 2016).

Improper disposal of waste entails 
that extreme hydrometeorological 
phenomena bring about large 
concentrations of suspended solid 
waste materials that affect the 
provision and quality of the potable 
water supply (IDB, 2015).

Gender violence is also 
considered an important problem. 
Every year, hundreds of women 
are assaulted in the province of 
Panama, with a total tally of 11 women 
murdered in 2016 (Public Prosecution 
Service, 2016).

Discrimination against sexual 
minorities which translates into 
various forms of aggressive behavior, 
especially towards trans-gender 
persons (without having exact 
figures), and including, in many cases, 
rapes (ICHR, 2015; Public Prosecution 
Service, 2015).

Poorly controlled 
immigration, with 137,798 
residence permits issued to foreigners 
between 2010 and 2016, and 184,000 
immigrants. At this moment, there 
is no evidence of planning and 
procedure to inform the population 
about this issue.

STRESSES

Corruption increases with 
money laundering, which then creates 
a considerable negative effect on 
the banking subsector. Between 
2013 and 2015, a total number of 
236 investigations were reported, 
involving drugs, embezzlement, 
bribery of public officials, unjust 
enrichment, white-collar crimes, 
transnational precedents, crimes 
against copyright and related rights 
(CNBC, 2016).

The expansion of the 
urban pattern (northwards, 
eastwards and westwards) is not 
accompanied by suitable structural 
and management measures. It is 
difficult to move in the farthest, 
isolated, poorest, and unsafe areas.

The decline of wetlands 
which help to control the hydrological 
regime, is caused by landfills that 
heighten risks, in addition to climate 
change (IH Cantabria, 2016). This 
decline, in turn, could also affect food 
resources and fishing productivity, 
whose related exports are estimated 
to amount by way of national 
economic revenues to 2,937 U.S. 
dollars/hectare/year for the fishing 
resources coming from all over the 
Pacific area (ANAM-ARAP 2013).

RESILIENT PANAMASHOCKS AND STRESSES  The  city  has  a  plain  topography  towards  the 
coast,  which  elevates  towards  the  mountainous 
range of Peñon Hill and Azul Hill, so it is possi-
ble  to  observe  an  increase  in  landslides  towards 
the area of houses, as well as the collapse of infra-
structure  over  weak  foundations  in  raised  zones. 
This  has  happened  mainly  in  the  district  of  San 
Miguelito  and  these  effects  have,  in  turn,  been 
aggravated  by  the  construction  being  performed 
without the corresponding land-use planning (Ser-
racan,  2002).  Moreover,  Panama  City  also  faces 
strong winds ahead affecting low-quality housing 
(Scodelaro et al, 2015).

STRESSES CONCERNING 
INFRASTRUCTURE, BASIC UTILITIES, 
HEALTHCARE AND NATURAL 
RESOURCES
The  economic  growth  of  the  country  encour-
aged the building industry, which brought about 
a high concentration of buildings in the coastline 

strip, without any coordination from the inter-in-
stitutional  level  and  little  intervention  of  Local 
Governments.  Said  disorderly  construction  has 
restricted access to various zones and has resulted 
in low availability of public transport choices, a sit-
uation which has worsened in the farthest, isolated 
zones (Scodelaro et at, 2015).
 
Informal  housing  has  poor  drainage  systems 
that  undergo  interruptions  to  the  potable  wa-
ter  supply  due  to  a  lack  of  planning  thereof  and 
caused  by  fractures  within  the  networks.  The 
lack  of  maintenance  of  the  system  is  also  a  re-
sult of a high level of delinquency in payment of 
utilities,  since  tax collection  does  not  manage  to 
provide  sufficient  funds  for  the  maintenance  of 
those  systems  (Delgado,  2014).  Poor  disposal  of 
solid waste impairs the population’s health, blocks 
drainage pipes and results in an increase of floods 
(Thompson, 2016). In this context, rivers tend to 
drag large concentrations of suspended solid waste 
during extreme hydrometeorological phenomena, 
thus  affecting  both  the  provision  and  quality  of

  Racial  discrimination  against  Afro-descen-
dents and indigenous people has brought about a 
tendency to drive them towards the poorest neigh-
borhoods. This population also tends to get low-
er-paid jobs (OACNUDH, 2013; De León 2016).
 
In Panama, gender violence still is a problem 
to be solved. In the Province of Panama, 11 wom-
en  were  murdered  in  2016  and  13  women  were 
killed in 2017 (Public Prosecution Service 2016a,  
2018).  Also,  sexual  minorities  are  discriminated, 
as  their  members  are  assaulted  and  restrained  in 
their citizenship rights (CIDH-OEA, 2015; Pub-
lic  Prosecution  Service  2015,  2016b).  Security  is 
relatively  stable,  since  there  are  between  0  and 
100 crimes per year (SIEC, 2016) in most of the 
City’s downtown; however, there are high crime 
rates, between 101 and 520 crimes per year (SIEC, 
2016), in the areas with a higher level of poverty 
(as  in  the  farthest  northern  and  eastern  areas  of 
the city). Uncontrolled migration has also brought 
about conflicts between immigrants and nationals, 
as there has been no adequate integration of these 
groups within the local setting.

the potable water supply (Scoderalo et al, 2015). 
Water courses contaminated by the concentration 
of solid waste material foster the development of 
diseases, such as dengue and malaria (Thompson, 
2016). In addition, soil has inadequate permeabili-
ty which has aggravated the effects of floods. One 
example of this practice is the removal of wetlands 
for  construction  of  buildings,  roads  and  landfills. 
These,  of  course,  function  as  natural  controls  of 
the  hydrological  regime,  so  the  disappearance 
thereof  can  only  worsen  the  effects  of  climate 
change (IH Cantabria, 2016). 

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRESSES
Despite  the  benefits  of  economic  development, 
in comparison with the other cities in the region, 
Panama  City  has  the  following  characteristics 
(Arup, 2018): 

 
 
 

- A high inequity 
- High poverty levels and extreme poverty 
-  Low  achievement  results  in  reading  and 
mathematics tests

“Money  laundering”  has  brought  about corrosive 
effects  on  the  economy,  for  instance:  the  bank-
ruptcy of  legally established  businesses,  a  distor-
tion  of  economic  growth,  changes  in  inflation, 
destabilization of prices, social breakdown, loss of 
assets and violence (Journal La Estrella de Pana-
má, 2011; CNBC, 2016).

Between  2009  and  2014  unemployment  showed 
a  downward  tendency  from  5.9%  through  3.8%, 
which  proves  a  significant  decline  since  2011  in 
Panama  City  (3.2%  in  the  province  of  Panama 
and 2.2% across the country). However, in 2014, 
informal employment in the province of Panama 
reached 30%, i.e. there is one informal worker for 
every  two  formal  employees.  The  high  informal 
employment rate implies a loss of tax revenues for 
the State (Arup, 2018).

RESILIENT PANAMAHow to Read the Resilience Strategy

This resilience strategy presents five pillars made up of eleven 
goals and forty-five actions.

Actions account for a variety of programs, proj-
ects, and plans, which, given their value, have 
been estimated as a top priority for the city and 
others as flagship to make it possible to establish 
the evaluation logic.

Each and every one of the actions presented 
within the pillars are actions that give a resilience 
value for the city, while having a special value 
for the working tasks of the Sustainable Devel-
opment Growth, which must be aligned with the 
Action Plan.

Strategy Pillars 
Each pillar is envisaged as action lines in the 
construction of resilience for the City, one 
which recognizes its own dynamics and power, 
in addition to its own strategic value. The goals 
outline the target at which the results of actions 
are aimed.

Proposal

TIMEFRAME 

Medium term

One of the transport issues identified in Panama City was 
that the initiatives to do carpooling are limited, for there is 
no social communication about how it works and its main 
differences with respect to collective means of transport. 
Carpooling is a global trend, which has been implemented 
in cities wishing to maximize transportation options for 
their citizens. 
 
As an integral part of this action, the feasibility to 
create a carpooling application will be analyzed in order 
to lower costs for users and integrate safety features and 
lessons learned across the world. 
INSPIRATION: the application of cycle lanes in the city of 
Melbourne and carpooling schemes in the city of Atlanta.

It will promote the social values of harmony, social 

cohesion and empathy.

Problem Statement 

T

he Republic of Panama is one of the 
fastest growing economies across the 
world, but at the same time with the 
highest inequality rate (Arup, 2018). 
Both population and economic activities are con-
centrated in the metropolitan area of the Pacific, 
where  roughly  44%  of  the  population  actually 
reside.  Panama  City’s  challenge  is  to  promote 
broader access to opportunities both in terms of 
education and infrastructure, in order to achieve 
better  results  that  may  improve  its  residents’ 
quality of working life. The lack of skilled human 
capital  (due  to  poor-quality  education)  has  had 
negative effects both in terms of economic fair-
ness  and  exploitation  of  present  opportunities. 
The  population  is  not  being  adequately  trained 
to  satisfy  the  city’s  economic  demands.  For  in-
stance,  the  building  industry  has  been  relying 
on  abundant,  but  unskilled,  manpower.  While 
the  sectors  involving  professional,  financial,  in-
surance,  real  estate  and  ICT  services  (which 
account  for  30%  of  new  jobs)  need  to  rely  on 
skilled  manpower  (Arup,  2018)  which  is  hardly 
furnished with the local work force.

  Over the years, a considerable gap has been 
growing between labor supply and demand, which 
has  been  somehow  mitigated  thanks  to  foreign 
migration of skilled manpower (Hausmann, 2017). 
Nevertheless,  said  economic  concentration  on 
services  associated  with  foreign  trade  has  made 
it vulnerable to foreign conditions. It is necessary 
to  diversify  the  economic  system  so  that  it  can 
become  sustainable  and,  therefore,  have  the 
capacity to include most of the population within 
economic growth, thus capitalizing on synergies 
among  various  industries,  such  as  ecotourism, 
agriculture  and  fishing  for  export.  Also,  it  is 
mandatory  to  narrow  the  bonds  between  the 
private  and  education  sectors  so  as  to  bridge 
the gap between job supply and demand (Arup, 
2018).  Growth  of  the  urban  pattern  in  terms  of 
infrastructure  and  population,  especially  due  to 
informal slums, has brought about some problems 
in  the  city  that  particularly  affect  marginalized 
sectors 
in  their  capacity  to  develop  their 
potential  and  access  new  opportunities.  Lack 
of  public  transport  options  makes  it  difficult  for 
the  population  to  occupy  spaces  in  educational 

59

and  labor  settings.  Nowadays,  public  transport 
is  inadequate  both  in  the  city’s  downtown  and 
outskirts,  mobility  services  are  not  integrated 
and  this  causes  costs  to  rise,  the  use  of  private 
transportation to be preferred, and the population’s 
insecurity  to  increase  since  they  are  forced  to 
use  informal  means  of  transport  operating  along 
dangerous roads with high crime rates (EY, 2018).

  Panama  has  both  the  infrastructure  and  will 
within its institutions necessary to make a change. 
These features may contribute to obtain a better 
education  supply  proposing  short-  and  medi-
um-term solutions in order to allow the population 
to  make  the  most  of  the  fledgling  opportunities 
arising during the process of economic growth.

1.1  To foster better quality of life 

based on more integrated 
mobility

The city must establish policies supporting the infrastructure and 
existence of an Integrated Transportation System by specially focusing 
on quality in the operation of transport and including the most isolated 
areas so that they can also take part in said process of integration.

RESILIENT PANAMAACTION 1.1.1.

TYPE: PLAN

Design and implementation of the  
non-motorized mobility Master Plan  
for Panama City

The  Comprehensive  Plan  for  Sustainable  Urban  Mobility 
(PIMUS, as per its official acronym in Spanish) proposes for 
Panama  City  to  adopt  a  policy  targeted  at  fostering  a  new 
layout of road space, as well as the harmonic, efficient, and 
safe coexistence of all the means of transport, including pe-
destrians and cyclists under a full-street model. The PIMUS 
provides  the  bases  for  promoting  and  installing  non-motor-
ized  mobility  as  an  alternative  mobility  choice  for  the  city, 
especially the use of bikes as an alternative mobility option to 
effectively move within the city. 
  The non-motorized mobility Master Plan will identify and 
define a network of cycle pathways and lanes in Panama City 
in  an  integrated  fashion  within  the  framework  of  the  city’s 
transportation plans. The network will respond both to the de-
mand and the needs of users who still don’t see this alternative 
means of transport as a resource for their own mobility. The 
plan will include the layout and technical, economic, financial, 
environmental and legal feasibility for the execution and op-
eration of cycle pathways and lanes. A layout handbook will 
be developed and institutional policies will be defined for the 
planning and execution of the cycling infrastructure networks. 
In  addition,  cycling  education  and  promotion  plans  will  be 
proposed and the existing regulations will be reviewed. The 
execution of all these components will enable the construction 
of cycle pathways in Panama City to be implemented in accor-
dance with best global practices. At present, some cycle lanes 
have been implemented in Ecuador Avenue, by way of tactic 
urban planning.  However, the Plan will promote an integrated 
vision for sustainable mobility in Panama City. 
  The design and implementation of the Plan will make it 
possible  to  position  non-motorized  mobility  as  a  means  of 
optimum and efficient means of transport both with environ-
mental and public health benefits.

Strategic Plan for the ordering  
of informal transport

New policy for carpooling in 
neighborhoods

The  Plan  proposes  the  ordering  of  public  transportation 
providers in the least connected neighborhoods, starting in 
the north and east of the city. Currently, there is no smooth 
functioning, or sufficient shuttle buses for the main public 
transportation routes. However, there are some providers 
with some regulation by the ATTT, but without the en-
gagement of local authority.
  This action consists of reorganizing the service of the 
existing collective transportation providers. The use of new 
technologies under study will play a fundamental role, in-
cluding the use of centralized electronic backup, as well as 
innovation systems to regularize the service frequency.

ahead,  associated  with  the  excessive  use  of  private  vehi-
cles to the detriment of other mobility means. The latest 
investment in new infrastructure (the Panama Metro, Mi-
Bus, Fast-Lanes) shows the positive effect new investment 
has on public transportation. Therefore, opportunity arises 
at the local level to contribute to the creation of an integrat-
ed transportation system with universal access. A part of 
such initiative is to have fast-lanes giving priority to public 
transportation. 
  Within the context of PIMUS (Comprehensive Urban 
Mobility Plan), the ATTT, together with the Municipali-
ty and other mobility agencies, will implement preferential 
and/or exclusive lanes for the main corridors concentrating 
bus routes. This system has the potential to be expanded to 
other important roads, such as Calle 50, Avenue Ricardo J. 
Alfaro, Av. Simon Bolivar (trans isthmic highway), so as to 
form an integrated network covering the whole city. The 
implementation  of  exclusive  public  transportation  lanes 
also  creates  the  opportunity  to  improve  the  urban  land-
scape.  The  stops  may  concentrate  shelter  areas  for  rains 
and extreme weather conditions, as well as provide wireless 
connection to the Internet (Wi-Fi). The alterations of the 
width or number of lanes also offer the opportunity to inte-
grate cycle lanes and forestry suitable for the city’s climate.

Thus, this action proposes the following interventions for 
the infrastructure of roads:

- 

- 

- 

- 

 To adjust the width of lanes or to eliminate the circula-
tion or parking lane to be assigned as the exclusive lane. 
By making these changes, the city may incorporate a 
cycling lane and widen the sidewalks to give priority to 
pedestrians. 
 To  demarcate  exclusive  lanes  with  physical  elements. 
These elements may be plants, shrubs and/or trees giv-
ing shade, thus cooling those areas and functioning as 
carbon dioxide recollection agents.
 To install vertical signals and cat’s eyes on the pavement 
to indicate the use of lanes with distinctive colors.
 To use permeable or porous pavement allowing water to 
flow through it and thus promote water drainage. The 
ground surface stays relatively dry and without stagnant 
water.

At transportation stops: 

- 

- 

- 

 To improve the distance between stations, which should 
neither be any shorter than 0.3 km nor any longer than 
0.8 km (The Scorecard, n.d.).
 Stops must be both safe and comfortable for users. Four 
elements  contribute  to  create  good  stations:  width, 
weather sheltering, safety and attractive look.  In Pana-
ma, stop roofs may be green spaces absorbing water and 
functioning as a cooling system for the waiting zone.
 Stations  must  be  designed  to  afford  universal  access, 
including clients with disabilities or visual or hearing im-
pairments.

In regard to coordination/planning:

- 

- 

 The Municipality will lead actions to improving mobil-
ity  and  coordinate,  jointly  with  the  stake-holding  au-
thorities, a review of the applicable regulations. 
 Regulations will be implemented so that lanes are kept 
free of any parking vehicles.

PUBLIC POLICY

- 

- 

- 

 The Municipality will lead a campaign for the use of ex-
clusive lanes, massive transportation and active mobility 
with the corresponding public hearings.
 In the long term, bus operators may provide information 
about the service schedule, changes of routes or delays 
and any other kind of dynamic information on electron-
ic panels or by using the Wi-Fi zones available at stops.
 Static information at stops, routes, maps, and emergen-
cy information will be marked at every station. 

The Municipality will monitor the use of the existing lanes 
(Justo Arosemena, Calle 50 and Cinta Costera -Coastline 
Belt-) in order to streamline, improve, and redesign them. 
For such monitoring, there are several alternatives including: 

-  

-  

-  

- 

 To install surveillance OCT (Optical Character Recog-
nition) cameras to detect misuse of exclusive lanes.
 Cameras on buses to monitor the use of lanes. This sys-
tem may be connected to MiBus and to the Municipal-
ity’s Surveillance Center.
 Police  presence  and/or  traffic  authority’s  control  to 
watch out for proper use of lanes. 
 The municipality will have a monitoring system for the 
public so as to evaluate any further improvements. 

INSPIRATION FROM 
Amman, Jordan
 

The city of Amman, Jordan, is in the process of planning and building an 
efficient bus rapid transportation (BRT) system. The first phase of the 
project will create three routes in key areas; afterwards, it will expand to 
cover all the neighborhoods of Amman. The resilience strategy initiative 
implies the creation of the city’s first BRT system, where high-capacity 
buses will run along exclusive and separate lanes; likewise, it will require 
the development and design of stops, stations, passenger information, 
vehicle specifications, and BRT exchanges and terminals. Once these first 
three routes have been completed, a massive, safe, and attainable traffic 
system competing with the use of cars for all the citizens of Amman, 
also including vehicle owners, will be offered. The city’s goal is that this 
system can increase the use of public transportation from 13% to 20% 
for 2019. Amman’s BRT system will not only offer new mobility options, 
but it will also improve citizens’ access to goods and services, as well 
as reduce polluting emissions thus improving the quality of air, and it 
will contribute in furtherance of Amman’s resilience goals concerning 
efficiency, inclusion and sustainability.

Heavy vehicle traffic control

The Comprehensive Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (PI-
MUS)  proposes  adopting  a  program  for  the  urban  distri-
bution of goods, with exclusive spaces for controlled loads 
and unloads. Within this context, the Municipality has al-
ready begun the ordering of parking spaces in certain areas 
such as the Via España (Spain Road).  This action implies 
the creation of a transfer center for large- and small-scale 
freight vehicles. Working roundtables will be held with the 
participation  of  municipalities  and  authorities  in  order  to 
review  the  current  situation  and  propose  necessary  regu-
lations and improvements. By way of contribution by the 
local authority to the manner in which regulations are being 
implemented, all the players involved will be convened in 
order  to  review  the  examples  where  they  could  see  how 
other cities have managed to act upon this issue. Thus, they 
will also review the way in which municipalities can be ca-
pable of complying with the time-schedule regulations in 
respect to the supply of commercial premises.

The  Municipality  of  San  Miguelito  has  taken  the  initial 
steps to carry out the evaluations and review the feasibility 
of the construction of the Metrocable; however, this must 
be  merged  into  a  plan  intended  for  the  construction  and

PROGRAM

Pilot Program for municipal  
charter schools

Panama has reached a time in its history when its trans-isthmic 
capacity has gone against its road traffic. Efficient and sustained 
operation of the Canal and the Platform of Global Services associated 
with it will increasingly rely on the sustainable growth of the country 
as a whole. And such development, unlike that based on its trans-
isthmic capacity, demands all of the potential of its geographic position 
as well as our population’s full capabilities.

can bring forth the necessary forms of governance required to solve

Charter schools are institutions that receive governmental 
funding,  but  they  operate  separately  from  the  state-run 
educational  system.  These  are  an  example  of  public  and 
private partnering in furtherance of formal schooling edu-
cation. Thus, this action focuses on implementing a pilot 
program for charter schools, as an alternative to boost core 
basic education. Said schools are half-autonomous and have 
greater flexibility to choose their teachers and usually have 
high  participation  from  students’  parents.  These  schools 
raise private funds to serve educational needs, ranging from 
procurement of equipment to hiring of personnel. The Mu-
nicipality  will  promote,  jointly  with  Central  Government 
institutions and the private sector, a pilot program with em-
phasis on educational centers where additional investments 
have already started. The Municipality’s team will support 
the creation of the respective programs and communication 
with contacts in the international sphere so as to implement 
these programs.

  The Municipality of Panama, through the Culture and 
Education  Division,  has  already  launched  STEAM  pro-
grams  through  Culture  Points,  which  are  given  by  virtue 
of  a  framework  agreement  between  MEDUCA  and  the 
Municipality of Panama.  Every official educational center 
will become a cultural center once a week.  In them, thou-
sands of children and adolescents may access, within their 
own  neighborhoods,  a  wide  variety of  activities,  such  as: 
painting, music, modern dance, hip hop, robotics or drama. 
These workshops will be led by specialists in social peda-
gogies, popular education and artistic techniques to stimu-
late creativity and intelligence. This action will expand and 
strengthen  theme  areas,  by  broadening  coverage  towards 
neighborhoods that have not implemented this work yet. 
Extended school days will be considered jointly with the 
schools,  in  order  to  strengthen  the  integration  of  artistic 
concepts with scientific fields.  In this respect, art will be a

The  “Panama,  a  Destination  for  Natural  and  Sustainable 
Tourism”  Program  proposes  promoting  empowerment  of 
operators from vulnerable communities near natural areas 
(basins, seaside resorts, swamps with bird sighting) in the 
northern and eastern area. In addition, communities with 
underexploited  cultural  elements  (unknown  monuments 
and pathways in the tropical rain forest, among others) will 
be  sought.  The  program  includes  the  making  of  a  refer-
enced tourism guide both for tourist guides and promoters. 
Also, it seeks to provide new operators with useful tools.
  Another aspect proposed is to place existing promoters 
into programs or to calculate the odds of creating one or 
more associations within the community setting. 
  For this purpose, a parallel diagnosis will be made in the 
communities, marketing and business plans with the aim to 
guarantee sustainability of the program. Finally, it is pro-
posed that municipalities should work with the divisions in 
the  making  of  a  plan  intended  to  review  the  various  ele-

Training exchange programs for  
nationals and foreigners  

The program puts forward some knowledge exchange and 
intercultural dialog projects between immigrants and locals 
with similar training levels and with a social integration ap-
proach. Evaluations conducted during development of the 
strategy indicate that much of the specialized job positions 
are covered by foreign skilled personnel and, at the same 
time,  Panama  has  some  difficulties  in  that  respect,  as  it 
doesn’t have enough skilled personnel. 
  This program opens new opportunities to the youngsters 
of Panama City so as to receive a direct benefit of the skills, 
experiences and knowledge of the foreign professionals re-
siding in Panama. This would give rise to a highly valuable 
setting to foster knowledge exchange and thus promote the 
valuable presence of immigrants for a better city.
  The  pilot  program  will  involve  the  Ciudad  del  Saber 
(City of Knowledge), an entity that gathers various interna-

Goals

2.1   To drive integration of communities

infrastructure.

2.2   To connect everyone in Panama City 

through a new infrastructure.

Problem Statement 

S

ocial cohesion is a necessary condi-
tion for optimum community devel-
opment  and  this  is  created,  above 
all,  when  housing  conditions  are 
transformed into friendly spaces for coexistence. 
In  other  words,  a  community  without  spaces 
for  interaction  leaves  no  chance  for  neighbors 
to  mutually  coexist  and  face  problems  togeth-
er (CEAPSA, 2018 b). The Local Government 
plays a key role in the creation of infrastructures 
promoting participation of its citizens, as well as 
the  obligation  to  guarantee  the  quality  of  basic 
services, such as: healthcare, education, housing 
and security (elements that can all add up to so-
cial cohesion) (CEASPA, 2018 b).
  Cohesive  communities  facilitate  interven-
tions  of  authorities  and  long-term  permanence 
of  programs  and  projects.  The  main  needs  in 
this  area  are  infrastructure  projects,  training 
programs,  and  service  programs  for  vulnerable 
groups  and  greater  mobility  facilities  for  dis-
abled people. The city has witnessed worsening 

community participation, while new communi-
ties and informal slums that have little govern-
mental support are constantly being developed 
(CEASPA, 2018b). Sidewalks, streetlights and 
communication  lines  tend  to  wear  out  in  pe-
ripheral areas surrounding Panama City. Recent 
efforts  to  improve  connectivity  of  peripheral 
neighborhoods  through  transportation  have  al-
lowed citizens to integrate (CEASPA, 2018b).
  The  work  done  by  workshops  and  direct 
consultation  meetings  with  communities  and 
non-governmental organizations, held within the 
framework of this strategy, suggests a number of 
projects with the potential to generate more cohe-
sion within communities and provide the city with 
a sense of belonging. These ideas include cultur-
al, recreational and sports-related proposals. Em-
phasis should also be placed on covering the basic 
mobility and cleanup needs, making an effort to 
ensure everybody’s integration with the city.

81

2.1   To drive integration of 

communities through a broader  
and better social infrastructure.

Social infrastructure is what we would call the “city’s hardware” 
because it helps to build physical spaces, both material and tangible, for 
coexistence and learning, where people can get together. When it comes 
to resilience, we mean social cohesion, identities and collectively shared 
visions. It is a topic not thoroughly understood in public policies, for we 
have to invest in human beings and their development, while creating 
the necessary conditions for the existence of social interaction and the 
construction of the social fabric that will make the communities strong 
enough to face any challenge.

PROJECT

Action plan for an integrated city  

Photo: MUPA

In order to monitor the construction of social infrastructure 
carried out by the local authority since 2014 and on the ba-
sis of the diagnosis made within the framework of the Resil-
ience Strategy, with the participation of community lead-
ers, surveys about the needs for infrastructure that make it 
possible to create spaces to strengthen social cohesion and 
local  identity,  were  carried  out.  The  “Action  Plan  for  an 
Integrated City” proposes a new portfolio of pilot projects 
for prompt execution in the farthest areas from the city’s 

downtown (to the north and east). Said areas are deficient 
in  infrastructure  and  funding  options  will  be  sought  with 
the aim to broaden the reach and effectiveness of such im-
provements. Proposals range from cultural centers, family 
centers and libraries to spaces for practicing sports. These 
pilot projects, even though intended for Alcalde Diaz, Er-
nesto Córdoba, Tocumen, Pacora and Kuna Nega neigh-
borhoods, constitute the beginning of a similar process for 
other communities of Panama.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY’S RESILIENCE  
Cultural spaces will bring about cohesion among 
citizens and, therefore, reduce conflicts, which 
are violent all the more often and related to 
little socialization, solidarity and communication 
between neighbors. 

Empathy between different cultures will thus be 

promoted, thereby creating more societies that 
are united and prepared to face any common 
challenges. 

The creation of spaces for sports will open 

opportunities for the young population to do 
alternative recreational activities. 

It will promote good mental and physical health of 

citizens.

INSPIRATION FROM 
Los Angeles, 
United States

The city of Los Angeles, in the United States, is prioritizing 
a resilience strategy initiative that will connect community 
organizations with experts and resources, with the aim to 
effectively guide and support the development of resilience 
centers in the surrounding vicinities. Chosen for their ease 
of access both for cycle and pedestrian lanes, as well as for 
their ability to reach vulnerable populations, these centers 
are conceived as physical spaces, located within reliable 
community organizations, which will add up to social and 
climate resilience, as well as to preparedness for and recovery 
from disasters. These centers will be reinforced with advanced 

technologies that will enhance electricity and water supply, communications, and seismic contingency services 
with the aim to guarantee that critical services remain active during and after the occurrence of a disaster. The 
centers will foster social cohesion while addressing the usual stress factors in the community through education 
and liaisons with existing programs and services of social and environmental management. Finally, the city of 
Los Angeles will encourage the creation of resilience centers based in the vicinities by streamlining the relevant 
regulatory processes and connecting the organizations that have key stakeholders who can provide guidance, 
technical assistance and financial capacity.

PROGRAM

Women’s Centers  

This action consists in the unification of efforts for gender 
equality. On the one hand, through the refurbishment of 
infrastructures and performance of activities organized by 
the  National  Women’s  Institute  (INAMU),  an  entity  fo-
cusing on equal opportunities for women and on the con-
struction  of  Comprehensive  Service  Center  for  Women 
(CINAMU), in the Bella Vista neighborhood, and the seat 
of the San Miguelito District. On the other hand, the Mu-
nicipality of Panama is currently developing the CEDIM’s 
project (Center for Entrepreneurship and Integral Develop-
ment of Women), which will be in the sector of Juan Diaz 
in Panama City, intended for women’s empowerment and 
training courses, as well as psychological, social and legal 
counseling. Then, there is an integration plan for joint pro-
cesses and actions between the CINAMUs and the CED-
IM, accompanied by NGOs and other organizations pur-
suing  empowerment  of  women  and  the  reinforcement  of 
the role played by such institutions. The adaptation of the 
infrastructure  of  the  Bella  Vista  CINAMU  in  association 
with the IDB’s representatives and those of the National 
Women’s Institute, could boost their cooperative work and 
thus bring about the strengthening of both initiatives, their

PROJECT

Municipal healthcare centers  

This project was one of the initiatives given priority by cit-
izens during the making of the consultations on the infra-
structure needs for social cohesion in vulnerable communi-
ties located in the northern and eastern area of the District 
of Panama. 
 
In the Ernesto Cordoba neighborhood, a new alternative 
location is expected for a healthcare center, thus replacing 
the existing facilities. In the Tocumen neighborhood, the 
initiative  seeks  to  improve  and  expand  the  infrastructure 
now heavily worn out. 
  The Municipality of Panama is expected, with the de-
centralization process under way, to be able to start under-
taking pilot projects intended to underpin the construction 
of infrastructure, which is prioritized by communities. 
  Two  pilot  projects  will  be  implemented  in  these  two 
neighborhoods - one for construction and the other for re-
furbishment of infrastructure; once these two pilot projects 
have been finished, any new interventions in other neigh-
borhoods can be assessed.

Municipal corporation of basic  
utility services  

Tactic urban development in 
downtown neighborhoods 

We propose that a municipal corporation be created based 
on  the  opportunities  given  by  the  Decentralization  Act. 
Nowadays, basic utility services are managed from various 
institutions such as the IDAAN for aqueducts and sewage 
systems,  the  Mi  Ambiente  and  the  ACP  for  the  hydro-
graphic basins, and the ASEP for the overall regulation of 
basic utility services, including private electric distribution 
companies.  Central  Government  management  requires 
support from the Local Government so that these utilities 
can  reach  the communities  more effectively  and  prompt-
ly.  The  priority  will  be  on  serving  the  vulnerable  neigh-
borhoods  of  Panama  City.  In  this  respect,  the  municipal 
corporation  will  give  priority  to  providing  the  following 
utility services: potable water and sewage systems, green 
energy (e.g. solar panels, LED) and cleanup of storm-water 
drainage systems, rivers and blocked ravines (e.g. removal 
of solid waste materials from the drains). The priority ap-
proach  for  establishment  of  those  utility  services  shall  be

The Municipality has recently implemented projects con-
cerning  public  space,  infrastructure,  and  basic  services  in 
the different neighborhoods in the city’s downtown. Areas 
such  as  Salsipuedes,  Santa  Ana,  Chorrillo,  Curundu,  El 
Marañon,  San  Sebastián,  Brooklincito, Calidonia,  Aveni-
da  Central,  Boca  La  Caja,  Panama  Viejo,  among  others, 
have benefitted from new sidewalks, buried infrastructure 
and landscape. These interventions are localized and have 
the potential to be connected within a network of coherent 
public spaces legible for citizens.
 
In order to enhance recent investments in public spaces, 
implementing a pilot project of Tactic Urban Development 
in  a  downtown  neighborhood  is  proposed,  thereby  con-
necting some of the interventions already implemented by 
the Municipality. The Tactic Urban Development process 
centers  on  the  fact  that  users  and  residents  of  any  given 
area will define the vision of what is to be done with public 
space in order to carry out low-cost interventions. These 
can include the widening of sidewalks, cycle lanes, recre-
ational spaces, green micro-areas, among others.  
  The  methodology  of  Tactic  Urban  Development  is 
based on  an  urban  intervention  approach  to construction 
and start-up of neighborhoods and their communities. It is 
an open and interactive concept based on short-term, scal-
able,  and  low-cost  interventions  and  policies.  This  arises 
as a response to the limitations of the city’s conventional 
development process, which is often slow and disconnected 
among the different players involved. This process is divid-
ed into small and incremental intervals, which then allows 
for  quicker  implementation,  greater  citizenship  participa-
tion, and streamlining of resource allocation.

workshops that enable neighbors and users to learn how to 
make a short-term change in their neighborhoods. These

ACTION 2.2.3.

INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT

Accessibility program in neighborhoods 

This action is sustained as a concrete recommendation to be 
implemented in the neighborhoods evaluated in 2018 with 
the participation of community leaders. There is a proposal 
centered on strengthening the work done by various divi-
sions  working  on  construction  of  sidewalk  and  pavement 
projects,  with  their  respective  integration  with  decentral-
ization  projects  and  other  means  of  financial  resources. 
Many projects are in the planning stage; however, the idea 
is to boost the effort and speed up its execution given the 
urgency existing in the communities subject to evaluation. 
Moreover, they suggest adding recommendations concern-
ing the resilience approach, as well as the inclusion of an 
infrastructure  refurbishment  program  for  disabled  people 
and  the  inclusion  of  streetlights  (with  a  LED  technolo-
gy-based approach). Initially, pilot programs will be carried 
out in the indigenous hamlet Kuna Nega, Gunglier Nega 
and the neighborhood Alcalde Diaz, where two thousand 
square meters of sidewalks have already been built. These 
actions will then be evaluated and expanded to other com-
munities, based on needs and depending on the priorities 
thus established. It should be mentioned that the Munici-
pality has already launched the construction of 95,000 m² 
in various neighborhoods, 40,000 m² for the northern area 
and 55,000 m² are scheduled to be executed for the east 
side.  Nevertheless,  200,000  m²  are  required  to  cover  the 
mobility  infrastructure  needs  in  the  different  boroughs of 
the  City,  therefore,  these  programs  are  a  beginning  of  a 
short-, medium-, and long-term process that must go hand 
in hand with other construction processes, such as the new 
subway lines.

PLAN

Implementation of the Comprehensive 
Mobility Plan for the Historic District 
(SAN FELIPE NEIGHBORHOOD)  

Through the IDB’s Integral Program of the Historical Cen-
ter, it is sought to implement actions within the framework 
of the Center Plan for the neighborhood of San Felipe, His-
torical Center, since it presents three major mobility prob-
lems in the area, namely: 

- 

- 
- 

- 

 Reduced  pedestrian  space  (70%  of  space  is  allocated 
to cars); barriers that hinder integration with the pub-
lic transportation system, as there is no full service of 
internal  transportation  and  adequate  infrastructure  for 
non-motorized mobility. 
Insecurity problems and deterioration of spaces. 
 Poor parking space management (demand from 4,200 
vehicles/day v. total supply of 1,579 parking lots; 30% 
of cars are illegally parked on public roads).
 The  Mobility  Plan  for  the  Historical Center of  Pana-
ma (Center Plan) includes the neighborhoods of San-
ta Ana, San Felipe, and El Chorrillo. It has seven lines 
of interrelated actions including the creation of public 
spaces, comprehensive management of parking space, 
improvements  in  public  transportation,  integration  of 
the Historical Center with the coastline belt. 

There will be joint efforts by and between the various enti-
ties involved, thereby integrating new ideas from the Mu-
nicipality and recommendations with a resilience approach. 
The Municipality would be the executor entity for this im-
plementation project concerning the Center Plan.

Problem Statement 

T

he City of Panama developed on the 
flood plains of its rivers, which led to 
the loss of riverbanks, deforestation 
of the natural habitat of species and 
the formation of danger zones for the population. 
Likewise,  the  infrastructure  of  slums  is  inade-
quate and the value of water and ecosystems is 
not well understood by the population, so good 
education in that respect is required. It is also rel-
evant  to  highlight  that  there  are  governance  is-
sues and decentralization offers opportunities for 
better local management.
  Since  2014,  the  municipality  has  conducted 
technical  studies  to  understand  problems  con-
cerned with floods so as to design proposals aimed 
at  mitigating  them.  Initially,  these  studies  fo-
cused on the basin of Juan Diaz River. It is there-
by sought to recover and protect riverbanks and 
their ecosystem services provided by urban wet-
lands. The municipality has a sustainability vision 
with investment proposals, city cleanup programs 

and improvement of drainage networks. In addi-
tion to technical studies, it is necessary to con-
solidate  the  capacity  of  action  upon  basins  and 
ecosystems crossing and bordering the city (100 
Resilient Cities, 2018a). Thus, the purpose is to 
contribute  to  an  adequate  management of  such 
resource, and with a reduction of vulnerabilities, 
in  order  to  promote  a  control  of  contamination 
from waste, to perform actions for the manage-
ment of the water capacity of rivers and basins, 
to  prevent  any  damage  to  ecosystems,  and  to 
foster the restoration thereof. Civic engagement 
in environmental communication and education 
will strengthen its capabilities, thus fostering its 
support.  (100  Resilient  Cities,  2018a).  In  order 
to rediscover the natural environment, it will be 
sought  to  promote  biodiversity  and  landscape 
amenities,  as  well  as  the  integration  of  wetland 
ecosystems with the decision-making process in 
danger zones.

3.1   To rethink the infrastructure 
that will protect us from the 
effects of climate change

Panama City is perched on five water basins, whose aquifers run 
along and bathe the city; however, its development has traditionally 
been treated by belittling this condition and, therefore, somehow 
“channeling” the water; to the point that, today, by way of a 
strainer effect, it overflows and oozes at various points across the 
26 neighborhoods.  In the middle of rapid  population growth and 
urban development in areas which were formerly naturals drains, 
today, proposing within the framework of resilience to address water 
management as an essential part of a development process bound to 
be sustainable, is one of the greatest urban challenges that we could 
face in this 21st century.  Because, in addition to this prior natural 
and anthropological condition, there is a situation caused by climate 
change, thus increasing our risk for floods.  This is why we, as a city 
facing its future development, propose that this must include water, 
not as an element to be overcome, but as a portion of the spaces to 
be recovered with the urban landscape and as a vital element in 
risk mitigation. The proper management of water can provide us 
with countless opportunities, ranging from supply for the growing 
percentage of the population who do not have access to potable water, 
and the mitigation of floods, through the valuation of soil in terms 
of its landscape value adding up to recreational space and visual 
enjoyment, to the various types of possible development.

This initiative takes as benchmark some national and 
international analogous cases, such as del Northern 
Park of Santa Fe, Argentina, the Water Park in 
Rotterdam, the green Infrastructure Plan in Oakland, 
USA, and Athens, Greece. Another example is the 
strategy titled Towards a Water-Sensitive Mexico 
City that promotes adequate water management by 
means of retention, storage, infiltration, and reuse.

Floods can be reduced by means of interventions intend-
ed to encourage bioretention in parks and easement areas, 
such  as  islands,  roundabouts  and  open  spaces.  These  fa-
cilities  serve  as  depressed  basins  located,  for  instance,  in 
gardens,  parks  and  other  green  areas  allowing  for  storm 
water runoffs to build up and seep through plants and soils 
with a temporary storage layer (evaporation of perspiration 
helps to deal with the volume). Said spaces make it possible 
for waters usually spreading across undesired ground spac-
es,  such  as  houses  and  commercial  premises,  to  head  for 

planned underground areas by means of their infiltration. 
The components of said areas are the following: pretreat-
ment,  inflow  runoff  zone,  storage  zone,  topsoil  layer,  soil 
mixture  for  bioretention,  vegetation,  lower  draining  bed, 
additional storage in gravel layer, and water overflow out-
let. In order to select suitable areas of the project, it is pro-
posed that consultations be made and, should intervention 
agreements be struck with other entities involved, to pres-
ent  the  criteria  for  green  infrastructure  systems’  planning 
and design. These latter actions are divided into three al-

INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM 

Coastline System of Open Spaces 

Panama City is located on the shores of Panama Bay, which 
occupies some 20 kilometers of waterfront. Over its histo-
ry, the city has been developing different interfaces with 
the Pacific Ocean, mostly invading and degrading coastal 
swamps, and often constructing high-density buildings up 
to the coastline. 
  The Coastline Belt project was initiated in 2007 as an 
opportunity to establish a network of public spaces along 
the waterfront. The Action Plan titled Metropolitan Pana-
ma, made by the Municipality of Panama, jointly with the 
Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) in 2015, proposes 
the extension of this public space system towards the east. 
The waterfront taken into account for this stretch of land 
is located at a point where several significant environmental 
factors converge, namely: the nearness to the Pacific ocean 
coast, the network of rivers flowing into this area, the rapid 
development of slums without a suitable control of the use 
of soil, the degradation of swamps, the limited drainage and 
sewage systems, and the isolation of communities.  
  Therefore, the city seeks to develop a large-scale proj-
ect,  to  be  coordinated  by  means  of  the  Urban  Planning 
Division, jointly with the World Bank.  The objective of 
this initiative is to create an integration plan for the coast-
line edge so as to foster measures intended for the mitiga-
tion of present and future risks, including a better drainage 
from slums into coastal plains, improvement of urban infra-
structure to create multimodal access to the coast, and the 
strengthening  of  the  institutional  capacity  to  move  infra-
structure funding resources. 
  The extension of the Coastline Belt and the System of 
Open Spaces is then a comprehensive initiative for the re-
newal and transformation of the coastline zone through the 
introduction of green infrastructure by way of dampeners 

for vulnerabilities such as the effects caused by floods and 
storms. This project involves reinforcing the protection of 
coastal swamps and basins in order to improve the provision 
of local ecosystem services; thus enhancing the public’s ac-
cess to the coast, the enjoyment of the coastline landscape 
resource and available spaces for multimodal mobility.

The project includes three sections:

 

 1.    Central  Zone  with  existing  coastline  interventions 
(from Amador to Marbella): This segment is largely 
developed and interventions will consist of connec-
tivity and access.  

  2.  Urban  Expansion  Zone  without  coastal  treatment 
(from  Punta  Paitilla  to  Punta  del  Este):  A  section 
with the interventions seeking to connect neighbor-
hoods, create public access to the pier, and improve 
the neighborhood at Boca La Caja.   

  3.  Protection Zone of wetlands in Panama Bay (Ram-
sar Swamp Reserve): This section includes Juan Diaz 
River  where  interventions  will  focus  on  mitigating 
floods,  protecting  natural  habitats,  and  connecting 
the coastline edge. 

 

 
This project will be accompanied by a Resilience Commu-
nication Plan.

INSPIRATION 

FROM 
Thessaloniki, 
Greece

The city of Thessaloniki, in 
Greece, dedicated a complete 
pillar of its resilience strategy 
to “rediscovering the city’s 
relationship with the sea”, by 
means of refurbishment of the 
Thermaikos bay, where the 
water body along which the 
city stretches extends throughout the coastline 
edge. A recent refurbishment of the waterfront 
gave Thermaikos a new and important role within 
citizens’ daily life: now it is the most popular public 
space in town. In its resilience work, however, 
Thessaloniki recognized that all of the bay’s 
potential was still underused in terms of economic, 
environmental and recreational exploitation. The 
eleven initiatives within this pillar will combine to 
accomplish the city’s objectives: to integrate the 
bay’s economic and urban development; to improve 
environmental monitoring and to restore the 
bay’s ecosystem, thereby launching new regional 
governance systems for the management of coastal 
activities; to grow the bay’s cultural and natural 
capital to improve social cohesion and, in general, 
the city’s quality of life.

Tocumen River  

This action consists of a survey intended to understand vul-
nerability to floods in the expected urban development ar-
eas to the east of the city. By means of a mapping of vulner-
abilities to floods. The existing regulations concerning the 
use of soil will be evaluated, as well as the implementation 
thereof,  in  order  to  determine  the  scope  of  this  develop-
ment. One of the major critical spots in the area is Tocumen 
International Airport, which poses some threats and risks 
for floods. This survey will contribute some key informa-
tion for other initiatives in Panama, such as the project for 
reducing and mitigating floods in Juan Diaz River (funded 
by IDB), the Coastline System of Open Spaces (funded by 
WB),  and  some  other  assessments  involving  the  drawing 
up of models and/or scenarios for the city’s water basins. 
This action is going to be performed in coordination with 
the various sectors involved in the interventions due for the 
area; advances will be communicated and key information 
will be shared so that it can help to achieve the maximum 
use of resources, thus avoiding the duplicity of efforts.

INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM 

Resilient Urban Juan 
Diaz Basin 

The Juan Diaz River basin has undergone an accelerated 
urbanization  process,  especially  since  1960.  The  lack  of 
ordering  plans  and  loose  enforcement  of  environmental 
protection regulations has resulted in a high degradation of 
the river’s water course. At this moment, Juan Diaz River’s 
riverbanks present some illegal occupations, infrastructure 
works  not  matching  the  basin’s  flows,  and  developments 
carried out in violation of the river protection easements; 
hence, this results in frequent and raging floods, public and 
private property damage, and a low quality of public space. 
  The project of regeneration of the urban basin of Juan 
Diaz River aims at the design and construction of green and 
blue  infrastructure  measures  intended  to  mitigate  climate 
vulnerability, increase the value of environmental assets, and 
thus improve the quality of urban habitat along the basin.

The project has three components:

 Strategic canalizing of Juan Diaz River, which includes 
developing retention ponds. This green infrastructure is 
a low-impact measure to supplement strategic drainage 
works that are necessary in various sections of the river. 
In the upper areas, it is proposed to create runoff mi-
cro-retention measures and works to reduce the speed 
of  water  flows.  In  the  intermediate  sections,  the  con-
struction of green water absorption and retention infra-
structure, such as flood parks and green areas, will be 
given priority, jointly with the landscape recovery and 
regularization of the river box. In the lower basin of Juan 
Diaz River, as in Radial City (a mostly low- and me-
dium-income community) and Metro Park (a logistical 
development with high income), specific infrastructure 
measures  intended  for  reducing  floods  to  a  minimum, 
such as the recovery of coastline meanders and swamps, 
will be given priority.

INSPIRATION FROM 
Vejle, Denmark

Credit: Resilient Vejle

The city of Vejle, in Denmark, is facing risks caused by floods from the adjacent fjord. 
The city is providing resilience to this challenge through the ambitious initiative called 
“Fjordbyen”, where they will use its waterfront areas as urban design laboratories to 
explore innovative and integrated solutions, e.g.: the adaptation of public spaces to 
improve the administration of water and thus boost economic growth while reducing 
risk. In particular, Vejle is planning to design defenses against floods that should also 
encourage investments, developments and have a higher real estate worth. One example 
is the vicinity of Østbykvarteret, which has a testing area where interventions concerning 
floods have a recreational and community value; moreover, it is sought to protect the 
inner areas of river Grejs by installing solutions to floods, already integrated along the 
road infrastructure so that they can reduce the water flow. The key to all this work will be 
a broad commitment undertaken by the stakeholders, participating experts and citizens, 
and an inclusive community-oriented urban design.

HYDRAULIC MODELS OF MUNICIPAL HYDROGRAPHIC BASINS

Photo: Karl Kaufmann

The changes in the use of soil and occupation of areas sub-
ject to floods with landfills, urbanizations and communica-
tion lines has reduced the hydraulic capacity of urban land, 
thereby increasing floods. Local authorities do not have a 
full map of risks in the urban basins; it requires a compre-
hensive, validated tool to integrate the map of risks to the 
ordering plans and thus foster an informed decision-making 
process. The area under study encompasses basins such as 
those of rivers Chagres, Matasnillo, Juan Diaz, and Pacora. 
The aim is to create a database containing hydraulic models 
of  the  basins  and  to  develop  a  platform  where  users  can 

observe the flood levels in rivers and floodplains for a recur-
rence between 2 to 500 years, thereby taking into account 
the changes in sea level. With this model, flood maps would 
be created  in order  to evaluate  the  impact of  projects on 
danger zones.
  The project will be conducted in phases by means of 
surveys  and  field  measurements,  collection  of  models, 
modeling,  analyses,  calibration  and  training  for  the  staff 
so  as  to  proceed  with  the  assessment  and  updating  of 
information. For such purposes, it is necessary to validate all 
of the existing studies and to create a database that contains

Not so long ago, the percentage of the world’s population living in cities 
outnumbered those who live in rural areas: today we are an essentially 
urban species. Cities and their inhabitants vary but they are somehow 
similar in the fact that most of them are far away from nature: we live 
as if we were not an integral part of the natural world. The truth is 
that even under adverse conditions, nature tries to find its way, and 
citizens can be interested in knowing and protecting it a little bit more.

able management of water and ecosystems. This strategy 
will  foster  participation  in  social  media  activities  and  the 
creation of commemorative committees. Synergies will be 
sought among the Awareness, Skill Enhancement and Edu-
cation Plan, within the framework of the Convention Ram-
sar (CeCop Plan, training courses of the Regional Center

of the Municipal Summit Park, the Metropolitan Park, the 
National  Sovereignty  Bar,  National  Park  of  Camino  de 
Cruces, and the Recreational Omar Park, thereby promot-
ing the District Biodiversity. 
  Awareness campaigns will be launched to promote the 
best  use  of  potable  water  and  conservation  of  wetlands. 
These  campaigns  will  publicize  municipal  programs,  like 
Zero Trash, and compliance of regulations, as is the pro-
hibition of using plastic bags. The communication strategy 
will encompass and include some concepts about ecosys-
tem services, valuation and adaptation to climate change, 
as well as good practices for management of the fishing re-

Comprehensive cost-benefit analysis 
(CBA) of development options around 
wetlands 

Traditional  CBAs  usually  have  a  limited  scope  and  only 
include  such  elements  as  the  construction  costs  of  the 
project, selling prices, fiscal revenues, and other common 
measurements of the project. This study proposes a com-
prehensive CBA to capture a wider variety of benefits of 
the wetlands in the project areas where it is sought to build 
constructions; i.e. to make private uses of the soil, thus pro-
moting the non-intervention of ecosystems by considering 
the valuation of natural capital. 
  Ecosystem  services  will  be contemplated,  such  as  the 
reduction of rain and the runoff by contamination, or the 
enhancement  of  benefits  for  human  health.  These  may 
integrate the ecosystem value in the decision-making pro-
cess,  since  these  values  of  natural  capital  and  knock-on 
effects of the loss of resources due to the development of 
infrastructure must be taken into account as a decrease in 
the  population’s  benefits.  For  example,  in  regards  to  this 
setting, the approval of blueprints by the Urban Planning 
Division would be considered, as well as construction per-
mits by the Works and Constructions Division (MUPA), 
and  the  assessment  criteria  for  environmental  impact  in 
order to promote their integration in the Interinstitutional 
Evaluation System. 
  The  results  of  the  CBA  will  be  a  key  input  for  the 
land use plan within the framework of the Land Use Plan 
(POT), as per its official acronym in Spanish).

CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY’S RESILIENCE  
The local authorities and communities may under-

stand and have valuation concepts of the natural 
capital and a supporting ground for the protection 
of natural resources as a clear understanding by 
both developers and the private sector. 

An adequate valuation scheme will lead to the review 

of projects so that these can reconsider the need 
for intervention of basins and ecosystems of wet-
lands. 

It will promote the conservations and restoration of 
ecosystems in wetlands, thus enhancing the pres-
ence, permanence, and protection of services they 
provide people with in the face of the poundings of 
climate change. 

It will assure the safety of the food resource by pro-

tecting fishing resource recruitment zones. 

It will enhance the carbon sequestration potential of 
the ecosystems of urban wetlands, thus reducing 
the impact of polluting gases on the atmosphere.

the city.

understanding of their vulnerabilities. 

Problem Statement 

H

istorically in Panama, the duties con-
cerning risk management have been 
centralized  in  national  institutions; 
however, it is high time we increased 
engagement of  local  governments  in  the  reduc-
tion of vulnerabilities through actions intended to 
face and address both threats and disasters. This 
proposal is to build better coordination in the face 
of the frequent impact caused by climate change, 
as well as to diminish the uncertainty arising from 
the lack of information about potential threats.
  For  the  Municipality,  the  Public  Manage-
ment  Decentralization  Act  represents  a  unique 
opportunity  to  create  local  leadership  in  risk 
management.  The  National  Civil  Protection 
System (SINAPROC), an entity focused on re-
sponding to disasters of any origin, is a valuable 
ally.  The  understanding  of  threats  and  vulner-
abilities in the territory, based on scientific evi-
dence, is a key element of the actions taken by 

municipalities in regard to risk management. This 
will be written down as the new Land Use Plan 
(POT) for District of Panama. An effective col-
laboration  with  institutions  of  the  national  gov-
ernment, academia, and community and civil so-
ciety organizations, is going to be a fundamental 
factor for the operation of the existing planning 
instruments, thus playing an effective role for the 
Municipality in the reduction of risks for disasters 
(100 Resilient Cities, 2018b).
  The  Municipality  will  obtain  instruments 
through which it can socialize technical territorial 
information (whether seismic, hydrological or in-
frastructural), currently generated by specialized 
academic and professional organizations, but with 
the  consequential  problem  of  being  piecemeal 
and drafted in highly specialized languages. The 
communication of risk factors will play a key role 
in the effective action taken by municipalities. 

4.1   Local leadership of risk 
management in the City

If we start from the fact that human settlements are the result of 
a transformation from the natural environment to the man-built 
environment, in the case of our city, the little integration of the former 
to the processes concerned with the use and occupation of the soil 
becomes crystal-clear.  The city’s limited capacity to recover from 
the shocks and stresses is often subject to warns us that we should be 
more resilient. Hence, we are liable for implementing better territory 
planning instruments whose design should recognize and integrate the 
risk of and vulnerability to the effects of climate change.

PROJECT

Municipal multi-department system  
of geographic information 

Accelerated  growth  in  Panama  City  has  led  to  a  signifi-
cant number of buildings situated in danger zones. Rapid 
development  also  poses  an  important  challenge  to  make 
decisions on the territory, for there is a shortage of updat-
ed information. Within the Municipality of Panama, there 
are various sectors used as sources of geographical informa-
tion that have the potential to be coordinated and unified 
to offer a more integrated, useful, and thorough system for 
identifying risks. 
  The  initiative  focuses  on  the  integration  of  geospatial 
data in a unique geographic data system (SIG) for District 
of Panama. This will allow a larger amount of information 
to  be  made  available  to  public  officials  and  citizens  upon 
making their decisions. Some of these tools are already in 
progress and are driven by the Environmental Management 
Division and the Urban Planning Division.
  The SIG platform will have free access and contain lay-
ers with cadastral information (road and premises manage-
ment), risk information (types of soils and flood areas) and, 
in the future, dynamic information about the vulnerabilities 
existing in the city (water-table level, river flows and levels, 
rain meters, among others). This information will be made 
available to any user of the system in real time and it will 
provide access to historical data stored for sensitivity anal-
yses and monitoring of changes, as well as inputs from local 
academic and scientific organizations will be found.

integrating new tools for risk management. 

It will be a proposal of paradigm change for the

Panama  City  has  a  dynamic  real  estate  industry  that  is 
attractive for investing; however, a portion of such invest-
ments are usually made in danger zones due to unawareness 
of existing natural threats, as well as regulatory restrictions. 
In order to promote proactive use of information, this action 
focuses on the implementation of a system allowing the real 
estate owners to have clear collection of the permitted uses, 
urban conditions, and risk circumstances concerning them. 
This report shall be used as a starting point in the planning 
processes  of  projects  consisting  in  the  new  development, 
densification or refurbishment of properties. This will allow 
investors and property owners to understand the potential 
for developing a site and its restrictions before conducting 
any surveys and investments.  
  As a result, the local authority may apply its ordering 

schemes more effectively, in its capacity as planning enti-
ty, whilst promoting safer real estate developments. This 
system will articulate on the basis of key tools, such as the 
Land Use Plan (POT), danger zone maps and the constant 
updating of the databases of a Municipal Geographic Infor-
mation System.  
 
In practice, residents, land owners and interested devel-
opers are believed to have access to this information at any 
time. The Certificate of Prior Disclosures shall be attached 
to  every  municipal  submission  of  paperwork  associated 
with any given property, together with the project scheme 
proposal, its locations and both technical and SIG-related 
information from the very beginning of the whole process.  
This system is going to be made official by means of a Mu-

PROGRAM

Structural assessment:  

TRAINING AND CONSTRUCTION FOR VULNERABLE AREAS 

In Panama City, the houses most vulnerable to floods are 
located in the east zone. Given its geography and plain to-
pography, very close to sea level, these shocks have been 
exacerbated with the advent of climate change and even in-
creased in some other areas of the city. On the other hand, 
in the northern and central areas, many edifices are vulner-
able to landslides, mudslides and strong winds. These risks 
are localized in the most elevated areas of San Miguelito 
and neighborhoods such as Ernesto Cordoba, Las Cumbres 
and Alcalde Diaz. 
  This  initiative  seeks  to  carry  out  training  programs  of 
trades related to construction and technical support in the 
building of works for inhabitants of informal slums. The pro-
gram will be centered on creating a tool, as well as in training 
people, for rapid structural characterization of buildings. The 
rapid evaluation tool would consider a checklist to determine 
if it is necessary or not to conduct a structural evaluation of 
the houses and/or a structural reinforcement thereof. Such 
evaluation will be used as an initial instrument. 
  The program will teach how to use the evaluation tool 
and thus give relevant skills to the local population involved 
in this type of construction. The training of people in con-
struction-related trades helps to create future job opportu-
nities and thus enhance the knowledge of the people who 
are currently performing this task. Evaluators are expected 
to identify the structural system of the houses visited, cate-
gorize them, identify and document their vulnerabilities in 
terms of resistance to earthquakes and floods and direct the 
need for a more detailed investigation.
  The  program  will  carry  out  training  workshops  in  the 
most vulnerable communities and the long-term goal is to im-
prove the building capacity of the city’s lower-income com-
munities, so they can improve the construction quality of the 
houses and thus make them more resilient to the shocks and 
physical stresses they may experience in the future.

INSPIRATION FROM 
Medellin, Colombia

In Colombia, the city of 
Medellin is collaborating 
with the residents of 
informal slums in regard 
to house refurbishment, 
with the aim to improve 
their living conditions, 
besides incorporating their houses into the rest of 
the city and thus mitigating the risk of mudslides 
or earthquakes. Together with Build Change, a 
Partner of the 100RC Platform, an organization that 
endorses the efforts made by cities to improve the 
safety of buildings by means of seismic adaptations, 
Medellin’s Resilience Office created a handbook 
establishing the technical procedures and guidelines 
for the adaptation of houses to seismic resistance 
in Colombia. The national government approved 
these guidelines and provided funding to update 
pilot programs in 50 households. Nowadays, the city 
is working with the World Bank to obtain funds and 
expand the pilot program to thousands of informal 
households for the next years to come. Build Change 
is also training builders from different communities 
in construction techniques and methods, since these 
are necessary to evaluate and modernize houses. 
Therefore, this initiative will boost the local economy, 
raise awareness and improve risk management across 
the community, while underpinning the investment 
capacity of residents in their own communities.

PLAN

Municipal Comprehensive  
Contingency Plan

The Municipal Guide to Risks of Disasters in Panama for 
2016  is  a  document  that  has  just  been  published  to  sup-
port  the  work  of  local  governments  on  the  area  of  disas-
ter response and recovery. It is a methodological proposal 
presented  by  the  SINAPROC,  with  the  endorsement  of 
CEPREDENAC, with the aim to provide municipal gov-
ernments  with  a  tool  that  facilitates  the  analysis  of  risk 
conditions in their own territories and the identification of 
actions oriented towards the mitigation of risks of disasters.  
The Municipal Guide promotes municipalities’ active role 
in preparedness and response to disasters. 
  This  action  proposes  an  integral  management  of  risk 
based on a plan to be implemented at local level. The Con-
tingency  Plan  will  be  designed  within  the  framework  of 
the recommendations provided by the Municipal Guide to 
Risks of Disasters in Panama and will include the actions to 
take, the tasks to perform, the necessary resources and in-
dications for the population to prevent any known threats. 
  The goal is to have a local plan in accordance with the 
new guidelines given by the Sendai Framework for the Re-
duction  of  Risk  of  Disasters  2015-2030,  with  special  em-
phasis on awareness and training in prevention to be con-
ducted jointly with the relevant communities.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY’S RESILIENCE  
It will reaffirm the local authority’s commitment to 

facing the existing risks and effects of climate 
change. 

It will serve, besides the players involved, citizens and 

their own property. 

An orderly management of risks in the city will thus 
help: to make better use of resources, to prevent 
any duplicity of efforts and to streamline interac-
tions upon serving citizens in case of any threaten-
ing event. 

A city surrounded by wetlands, located on a coastline 

area and with potential risks for its infrastructure, 
does require its local authority to make the most 
of the opportunities given by decentralization in 
order to guarantee the safety of its residents. This 
will be accomplished by means of robust support 
positioning the entity as a leader of local risk man-
agement and as a governmental entity with wide 
availability to endorse management conducted by 
the SINAPROC. 

A city with all the considerations and variables thus 

studied and applied in a single instrument will 
boost its resilience to short-, medium- and long-
term shocks.

PROGRAM

Comprehensive Disaster Risk Reduction 
Program

Credit: MUPA

As a result of the city’s rapid growth and lack of integrated 
planning, families in the municipalities of Panama and San 
Miguelito have been settling down in danger zones in the 
last few decades. Every year, many of these communities 
undergo a significant number of drawbacks due to floods, 
landslides and highly strong winds. So far, there is no ade-
quate information available to understand the scale of these 
drawbacks, or any coordination scheme for the control of 
such shocks.
  Guided  by  the  best  resilience  practices  in  communi-
ties promoted by the International Federation of the Red 
Cross,  the  U.N.  International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Re-

duction (UNISDR), and the Rockefeller Foundation, this 
action seeks to maximize the role of communities and their 
citizens in the development of resilience at the local level. 
Community work will not only focus on improving services 
and infrastructures locally, but also on strengthening some 
other ‘soft’ aspects targeted at empowered individuals and 
families in the lowest-income communities. This includes 
aspects such as: understanding of citizens’ rights and du-
ties, health and self-care and understanding of the setting.

Within this context, the program will focus on three major 
components:

RESILIENT PANAMASTRATEGY PILLARS4  •  COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENTINSPIRATION FROM 
Da Nang, Vietnam

In Vietnam, the city of Da Nang 
is facing a substantial risk of 
typhoons and severe storms, 
which typically cause strong 
winds and floods that damage 
communities, especially the 
homes of people living in poverty 
conditions. In its resilience 
strategy, Da Nang is pursuing a 
series of complementary initiatives that will address the needs 
of such neighborhoods. These will map and assess the exposure 
of houses to storms, with the aim to produce disaster adaptation 
plans for the highest-risk vicinities. In order to put the 
information to work, training courses will be developed in the 
community concerning the recommended construction materials 
and the best building practices for resistant houses. Afterwards, 
efforts will be made to guarantee that residents could make 
use of these practices by expanding the funding available for 
loans. Finally, Da Nang will promote the scope, awareness and 
education intended to augment the community’s resilience and 
social cohesion, especially in regard to climate change and risk 
mitigation in case of natural disasters.

3.  Action plans

Community  workshops  and  campaigns  to  identify  risks, 
necessary  capabilities  and  existing  skills  to  offer  a  timely 
and effective action for risky situations. Community map-
ping methods will be used for residents to identify danger 
zones  and  the  factors  contributing  to  determine  them. 
Likewise, we will explore which practices, assets, and in-
frastructures  actually  make  the  community  safer,  and  we 
will try to identify the needs for information and training in 
‘soft’ issues, such as legal aid, self-care in community health 
and organization. 
  Technical support for an evaluation of the critical infra-
structure present in the community, especially that which 
can play a key role during emergencies, such as healthcare 
workstations,  schools,  kindergartens,  and  potable  water 
and cleanup systems. 

A  survey  requested  by  the  municipalities  to  synthesize 
the  existing  technical  knowledge  required  in  respect  to 
soil conditions, construction typologies, and forms of set-
tlement  that  exacerbate  the  vulnerabilities  of  houses  and 
infrastructure in the districts of Panama and San Miguelito.
 
Intermunicipal coordination board to define a roadmap 
designed to implement medium- and long-term actions, es-
pecially for any actions targeted at strengthening commu-
nity organizations and implementing risk mitigation works.

The  communities  will  make  a  Local  Action  Plan,  so  as 
to spot shelters, escape routes, early alerting systems and 
measures to reinforce community networks. The commu-
nication of this plan will be a component of utmost impor-
tance for the benefit citizens may reap from this initiative, 
so that they can adopt this learning in their daily life. 
  The  Action  Plan  will  also  identify  public  spaces  and 
priority infrastructures for the community and the neces-
sary  supports  for  the  formalization  and  consolidation  of 
the community in the medium term. The themes to be ex-
plored and articulated will include, but not be limited to, 
landholding, accesses to potable water and sewage systems.

On the other hand, the municipalities of Panama and San 
Miguelito will, in collaboration with the participants of the 
100  Resilient  Cities  network,  provide  support  and  moni-
toring aimed at implementing major works where foreign 
funding  and  support  are  required  as  mitigation  measures; 
for instance: legalization processes for landholding or instal-
lation of aqueducts.
  Given  the  complexity  of  the  work  required  and  the 
scales of needs existing in informal neighborhoods within 
the city of Panama, the work will start by carrying out a 
small number of pilot programs. Once these methods, re-
quired  alliances  and  community  support  processes  have 
been tested and streamlined, the program will be replicated 
in a larger number of communities.

PROGRAM, PUBLIC POLICY

Multi-Department Technical Board of 
Works & Infrastructures

The planning system in Panama is characterized by partici-
pation of various entities, both national and municipal. Given 
the diversity of these entities and the limited role of munic-
ipalities, much of the insight into risks within the territory 
generated locally is not integrated into the project develop-
ment and approval process. 
  This action focuses on the creation and implementation 
of a municipal scheme providing technical contribution, and 
with a multidisciplinary perspective, to the development and 
evaluation of projects in District of Panama. A multi-sector 
group will be created and formalized by way of a Technical 
Board, which will generate both contents and ideas for the 
review of projects. The objective of this effort will be to min-
imize risks in the implementation of the project, by encour-
aging good environmental design and collaboration practic-
es, as well as creation of technical dialogue spaces with the 
private sector and organizations from the civil society.
  This process has already started with meetings between 
the various divisions to review specific projects in flood zones 
with  the  support  of  an  online  platform.  In  the  future,  the 
work of such board is expected to mean a proactive contri-
bution to participate in the development of relevant projects 
for the city. By implementing a multidisciplinary team, ap-
proval authority levels may also integrate information from 
organizations of the civil society, the private sector and aca-
demic and/or scientific knowledge. Thus, the Municipality 
will not only play an approval role, but also take part in the 
improvement  of  the  quality  of  the  proposals  made  for  the 
city. This work will be supported by the SIG platform of the 
Municipality of Panama.
  The  monitoring  of  evaluations  will  include  real  estate 
and  mining  projects,  as  well  as  applications  for  landslides, 
blueprints  and  permits  granted  or  sought  to  be  granted, 
and  any  other  analysis  requested,  including  environmental 
impact assessments.

At this moment, the Local Government’s communication 
of  risk  to  civilians  is  carried  out  in  an  incidental  manner. 
Nevertheless, municipal actions to support civilians have an 
impact  and  are  recognized  by  communities,  this  brings  a 
valuable opportunity to connect municipal authorities with 
their residents, thus empowering the latter to be better pre-
pared for facing risks.
  This action proposes establishing a risk communication 
and education campaign enabling citizens to have a better 
understanding  of  the  existing  vulnerabilities  and  natural 
threats. 

The main components of this plan will include:

• 

•

 media campaign (TV, radio, social networks) for a safer city 

• 
•  and articles on local magazines and newspapers.

PROGRAM

Early Alert Program for the boroughs of 
the Metropolitan Area 

This initiative proposes creating a community program in-
tended to assure the effective functioning and use of early 
alert systems (SATs). SINAPROC has already started its 
efforts to implement early alert tools for floods in rivers lo-
cated to the east of the city, as is the case of Juan Diaz Riv-
er, with training given to the nearby communities. These 
should be extended to more zones in Panama City and San 
Miguelito. 
  This action seeks to enhance the work undertaken by 
SINAPROC, by establishing a local joint responsibility for 
the early alert tools. The municipalities of Panama and San 
Miguelito,  in  collaboration  with  the  competent  national 
authorities, will cooperate to review, understand, improve, 
and expand the alert systems to other areas of the city. 
 
In  line  with  the  studies  derived  from  SATs  and  per-
formed  earlier,  we  will  include  systems  associated  with 
three  key  threats  for  Panama  City:  landslides,  tsunamis, 
and floods.
  On a complementary basis, it is proposed that quarterly 
training courses be offered to the public at the municipal 
seats of Panama, San Miguelito and allied institutions. The 
program schedule will be publicized on the websites of each 
municipality.

Problem Statement 

T

he  public  administration  decentraliza-
tion process (as established by Law No. 
66 of October 29, 2015, as amended by 
Law No. 37 of 2009), promotes local de-
velopment, enhances transparency, transfers admin-
istrative  and  fiscal  jurisdictional  competencies,  and 
strengthens  governance  on  the  part  of  local  institu-
tions. This change places Panama City at a moment 
of  structural  and  budgetary  transition.  This  means 
that  the city  has  the chance  to  lay  the  foundations 
and establish processes potentially leading to a more 
empowered,  efficient,  organized,  and  result-driven 
management. 
  The Municipality has the potential to grow as a 
governmental  entity  and  conduct  a  modern  public 
administration,  based  on  evidence  and  functioning 
transparently and accessible for everyone. This new 
decentralization stage is going to make it possible to 
create processes that will make a long-term mark on 
local  administration  with  significant  engagement  of 
the civil society. 
  The Municipality does not have a robust project 
monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  Projects  do  not 
include results or impact indicators, which makes it 
harder to perform a real assessment that may help us 

highlight the advance of projects, create greater trans-
parency and/or seek funding. Likewise, it is necessary 
to elaborate a plan oriented towards a multi-year de-
velopment where resources should be allocated and 
evaluated in accordance with a plan. 
  A sustainable development leverages the impor-
tance  of  community  engagement.  This  entails  un-
derstanding of topics concerning human rights which 
involve all citizens, regardless of their ethnic group of 
origin, sex, sexual orientation, nationality and social 
condition  (CEASPA,  2018c).  In  order  to  address 
these issues and be able to evaluate what may happen 
in the future, a proposal of social cohesion indicators 
has been made (CEASPA, 2018a). Facing these chal-
lenges, strengthening the linkage between the various 
levels  of  Central  and  Local  Governments  becomes 
the  key  to  promoting  positive  shared  management 
and build a city for everyone.
  When inclusive management is boosted by effi-
ciently leveraging resources, it thus strengthens its ca-
pacity to measure impacts and improvements of its in-
stitutional capacity. Thus, the municipality becomes 
an  organization  of  greater  relevance  and  highlights 
the need for more autonomous local governments.

159

5.1   To strengthen management by 

streamlining both processes and 
resources  

It is of utmost importance that at management level, especially the 
municipal one, budgets prioritize resources for actions targeted at 
helping to mitigate and prevent any social or natural disaster. The 
vision lies in the fact that we should keep supporting both divisions and 
their own departments for the execution of risk management projects 
and the necessary resources to tell the whole community about the goals 
and achievements reached by said projects, as I consider that budget 
priority for resilience is an issue that goes beyond administrations, as it 
is a governance issue that deserved to be trusted by the various sectors 
of municipal management.

PROGRAM

How are we doing,  
Panama?

Since  April  2018,  the  Municipality,  jointly  with  the  Na-
tional  Competitiveness  Center  (CNC),  have  coordinated 
a program attended by presidents of organizations from the 
business field and representatives of the labor and govern-
mental sectors. The program is aimed at fostering actions 
leading  the  entities  to  a  better  and  greater  production, 
within  a  suitable  atmosphere  for  local  and  foreign  invest-
ments, thus promoting the population’s welfare. 
  As a part of this program, a civic monitoring system is 
being developed, the goals of which seek to foster informed, 
responsible, and participative residents through monitoring 
and  evaluation  of  the  city’s  quality  of  life.  Through  the 
creation  of  a  citizenship  observatory,  a  monitoring  and 
follow-up exercise through development indicators will be 
conducted on a regular basis.
  An evaluation of indicators by sectors is being proposed, 
with the respective making of opinion surveys, preparation 
of advance and systemic follow-up reports on the current 
condition  of  the  city,  including  social  cohesion  and  eq-
uity  indicators.  The  follow-up  of  indicators  will  promote 
informed decisions and an accountability process from the 
municipal government to the citizen.

Bidding processes based on more and 
better opportunities 

Collecting 110% for Panama 

Panama City wishes to obtain better solutions and options 
to the bidding processes it launches. The goal of this pro-
gram  consists  of  increasing  the  number  of  participating 
companies, regaining trust in the idea that the city is a good 
business partner, implementing innovation to achieve bet-
ter results, and making the whole process fair.
  We are working on a platform intended to help the mu-
nicipal government officials to offer better services, by con-
necting them to solutions, projects, departments, and cities 
across the world.
 
In  this  new  model,  the  bidding  process  starts  with  a 
declaration  of  opportunity,  which  generates  an  overview 
of any given project to be shared with the working teams. 
Then, we seek to enhance the engagement of new groups 
of  supplies  and  thus  multiply  the  results  of  the  bidding 
process. The municipal Zero Trash Program, jointly with 
the  Sub-Division  of  Public  Procurement,  are  working  on 
a pilot project of innovative bidding processes with the en-
dorsement of CityMart, which supports the making of the 
project and the bidding process for the solid waste disposal 
program.  We have made the proposal of the project based 
on an initial problem, a transparent communication strate-
gy in the bidding process, and methodologies to maximize 
suppliers’ bids for this type of service.

for public welfare and encouraging taxpayers to pay at will 
an additional 10% over their tax assessments.

-  Implementation  of  an  accountability  and  transparency 
system to connect the taxes paid by people with improve-
ments in services.

-  Generation of a comparison of tax payment and collec-
tion data where these are triangulated with other means 
to spot cases of delinquency and thus being able to trace 
and investigate any reasons for such arrears.

This initiative seeks to bolster municipal careers, underpin 
the knowledge and awareness of municipal and decentral-
ization laws and requirements, while improving administra-
tive processes, with the aim to empower the Municipality 
to start up new office duties. This action consists of three 
components:

-  To develop tools and drafting of handbooks of processes 
and procedures for the Procurement, Acquisition, Strate-
gic Planning and Budget Divisions. 

-  To provide knowledge and develop skills for the perfor-
mance of specific positions, with new tools that will help 
the personnel to use them, thus promoting the continu-
ance  of  administrations,  through  the  establishment  of 
expected  timeframes  for  preparedness,  strengthening  of 
socialization processes, execution of processes and stan-
dardization of the presentation of project profiles. 

-  Based  on  the  tools  and  training,  one  of  the  priorities 
would be the creation of a multi-year result-based budget 
establishing goals with indicators of results and impacts. 
This will be accompanied by a program of performance 
incentives based on the achievement of the goals of the

PUBLIC POLICY

Plan for the joint 
management of 
projects with the 
Central Government   

The Municipality of Panama is taking part in a decentral-
ization process requiring coordination and communication 
with the Central Government. It is key to keep open and 
fluent communication to avoid the lack of coordination, for 
this impacts the efficacy and efficiency in the making and 
implementation of public policies. Coordination and com-
munication are based on the need to present projects by the 
local Government, including Community Boards, to vari-
ous governmental agencies. At present, there is a liaison at 
municipal level for decentralization issues, but there is no 
formal structure of coordination for these schemes. 
 
In order to complete the various decentralization phases 
and be able to establish better synergies to undertake duties 
at the local level, a program and project-based management 
will be established with the Central Government, as well as 
interinstitutional planning processes. This initiative proposes:

-  A procedure to create a specific department for interin-
stitutional planning processes, encompassing an adequate 
organizational chart, duties, and direct needs to proceed 
with its operation.

-  A guide to technical and administrative processes for the 
making and planning of projects, maximization of resourc-
es and bidding processes, among others.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE CITY’S RESILIENCE  
The generation of opportunities for projects regarding 

the resilience issue will be maximized. 

There will be an opportunity for a prioritization of 

impact projects to improve risk management. 

Processes will be facilitated by means of a roadmap 
established in order to cater for the specific needs 
of the population and their continuity over time. This 
procedure will not only help to bolster processes 
and fund management by the Central Government 
with the Municipality in relation to the decentraliza-
tion process, but it may also lay the foundations of 
how to define joint work when it comes to programs 
executed by entities of the Central Government or 
external bodies that administer or execute financial 
resources with the endorsement and monitoring of 
the Central or Local Government.

The goal is to consolidate the geo-referenced information 
about each property, storm-water infrastructure, and other 
city  assets,  in  order  to  know  the  location  thereof  and  be 
able to foresee their development chances and the feasibili-
ty to build in those areas.
  The  Municipal  Property  Registry  Office  will  be  con-
nected to a platform of the Geographic Information Sys-
tem (SIG), which will make it possible to generate a risk 
factbook or vulnerable areas and updated documents about 
the various buildings within the municipality.
  This office will facilitate urban planning and risk man-
agement, while integrating a joint work with other divisions 
related to the social and environmental setting. This office 
will work in coordination with the Central Government and 
other key institutions in dealing with information making it 
possible to demarcate and geo-reference both premises and 
danger zones.

RESILIENT PANAMASTRATEGY PILLARS5  •  SHARED MANAGEMENT: BUILDING THE CITY5.2   To foster participation in order 

to build more co-responsible 
citizens

Citizenship participation is a key factor for the making of a resilience 
strategy, since it is the essence and material reality of the populations 
and communities living within them, so it is in their own people.  
The engagement dimension in public policymaking extending beyond 
administrations is of utmost importance through democratic, open, 
accessible, and adaptable methodologies so as to achieve a genuine joint 
social responsibility and the strengthening of social fabric, in search for 
societies that can proactively develop innovation capabilities and fair, 
integral and sustainable solutions.

This  action  focuses  on  defining  opportunities  to  increase 
the resilience of the Metropolitan Area of Panama by cre-
ating a medium- and long-term roadmap that will facilitate 
the resolution of priority problems affecting the boroughs 
of the Metropolitan Area. These may include the mobility 
issue, water management, ecosystems and natural resourc-
es,  among  others.  These  are  shared  topics  that  consider 
biophysical  connectivity  between  the  basins  associated 
with the Panama Canal and social connectivity due to the 
large  number  of  citizens  normally  commuting  between 
these cities. 
  The Resilience Division of the MUPA will serve as an 
advisor  for  the  other  boroughs  so  as  to  share  the  lessons 
learned from the construction of a Resilience Strategy, as 
well as to promote the creation of resilience offices in the

This proposes enhancing the programs executed with the 
Municipal Security Division and the Sub-Division of Cit-
izenship  Security  so  as  to  coordinate  joint  actions  taking 
into account various groups of citizens within the different 
security  schemes,  by  developing  actions  intended  to  en-
courage leadership and development of individuals’ capa-
bilities, both for public officials and the civil society. 
  Participatory workshops discussing the protection and 
equality of all persons, both nationals and foreigners, will 
be implemented. 
  The point is to update and provide the programs cur-
rently  implemented  with  new  ideas  concerning  equality, 
cultural coexistence between all the citizens residing in the 
district and a no violence approach. The strengthening of 
monitoring and surveillance systems in zones identified as 
highly prone to violence will be coordinated with agencies 
of the Central Government and civil society. Community 
networks will be taken into account for surveillance around 
neighborhoods and technological resources of the Munici-
pal Surveillance System will be used.

Let’s watch out for 
human rights   

The Municipality of Panama is making progress in human 
rights  issues  by  endorsing  and  sponsoring  events  where 
there is strong promotion of respect for the different groups 
making up its population.  
  This initiative seeks to implement a Citizenship Secu-
rity Plan that will boost efforts to communicate and raise 
awareness about human rights and equality. All the sectors 
and communities will be taken into account, while foster-
ing  security  and  peaceful  coexistence  within  the  district, 
regardless  of  race,  sexual  orientation,  physical  condition, 
gender or nationality. 
  The Plan focuses on strengthening the compliance of 
the Mayor’s Decree Number 28 of 2015 whereby measures 
to  prevent  discrimination  in  the  District  of  Panama  have 
been adopted.
  The Citizenship Security Plan covers gender equality 
issues  with  training  courses,  in  alliance  with  the  Culture 
and Education Division and the development of programs 
such as the Safe Women one. Synergies will be established 
with other programs, such as the so-called Together for a 
Community Free of Violence of the United Nations (U.N. 
Citizenship Security Program - SECOPA).
  The creation of the Plan includes coordination of work-
shops,  seminars,  conferences,  forums,  discussions,  and 
films to promote human rights. 
  Also,  the  need  to  create  local  public  policies  will  be 
evaluated, as well as a series of guidelines to foster non-dis-
crimination of the most vulnerable and segregated groups 
in the city.

RESILIENT PANAMASTRATEGY PILLARS5  •  SHARED MANAGEMENT: BUILDING THE CITYFOLLOWING STEPS

This is the first resilience strategy for District of Panama, in 

collaboration with the District of San Miguelito. This document 

helps to consolidate the proposal of a series of projects and 

initiatives that will enable us to focus on priorities and actions 

intended to achieve the change required for the city. Efforts will 

be made to undertake these responsibilities with leadership, 

thereby consolidating economic resources, overcoming political 

barriers and making full use of its new competences. This work 

will not be possible without the participation of the various 

sectors that have already consolidated a close collaboration with 

the local authority. 

The vision for this strategy is that it should serve as an instrument 

to overcome the barriers posed by any change of governmental 

administration in the next ten years to come. A follow-up of the 

implementation of each and every one of these actions will be 

conducted. As a whole, these actions show that this city, in spite 

of being located in danger zones, can develop in a sustainable 

fashion, while preserving its natural resources and leveraging the 

goods and services that the ecosystems around it provide us.

Given this historic opportunity to decide on the ordering of our 

territory, the Resilience Strategy proposes a series of first steps to 

take for a change of paradigm in the way we are building our city. 

This will in turn produce a knock-on effect on the rest of the cities 

across our country in favor of a resilient nation.
