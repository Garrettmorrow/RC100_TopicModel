Letter from the City Manager

Dear Friends,

Berkeley is a relatively small city, but our world class academic institutions, 
reputation for tolerance and inclusiveness, delicious local food, and access 
to the broader San Francisco Bay Area draw residents and visitors from 
around the world. The strength and texture of our city, and what makes 
it unique, is the people—the innovators, artists, activists, students, public 
servants, and families—young and old, who call Berkeley home. Our com-
munity’s resilience rests on our people and our ability to live well in good 
times and bounce back stronger than ever from the inevitable hard times. 

Developed with input and insights from the people of Berkeley, 
the Resilience Strategy is designed to articulate solutions that 
make our city more resilient not only to physical challenges, such 
as earthquakes, sea level rise, and aging infrastructure, but also to 
social challenges, such as racial inequity. At its core, the Resilience 
Strategy is about building resilience by building community. Strong 
connections between neighbors and lasting partnerships between 
community-serving organizations are vital to helping all residents, 
especially those most in need and historically underserved, to thrive. 

Berkeley’s Resilience Strategy is the launch point for several programs 
that foster these connections and partnerships. One of these programs 
that I am excited about is the new Community Resilience Center Program, 
which will enable several community-based organizations, in partnership 
with the City, to serve as hosts for training and conduits to disaster 
preparedness, public health, and other services that are tailored to the 
needs of the people the organizations serve. This program is a good 
example of what the practice of resilience looks like—it addresses more 
than one challenge at once and creates multiple benefits for many people.

I am proud of the many partnerships 
that have made the Resilience 
Strategy possible, and I look for-
ward to forming many additional 
partnerships that will enable its 
implementation. 100 Resilient Cities 
(100RC)—Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation—has provided 
invaluable support, guidance, and access to technical assistance. Our 
neighboring cities—Oakland and San Francisco—are also participat-
ing in 100RC, and continued collaboration in the region will help to 
amplify our work beyond the boundaries of our respective cities.

City Manager Dee Williams-Ridley standing next to 
the Peace Bell at Berkeley City Hall

Most of all, I am grateful to the Berkeley community for contributing 
to the Resilience Strategy and for what you do every day to make 
Berkeley the active, dynamic, and highly engaged community that 
it is. I invite all community members to review this report with 
an eye towards how you can join your friends, neighbors, and 
colleagues in making Berkeley a model of city resilience. 

Sincerely, 

Dee Williams-Ridley 
City Manager

Introduction and Purpose

In 2014 the City of Berkeley (City), along with our neighboring cities of 
Oakland and San Francisco, was one of the first 32 cities selected to 
participate in 100 Resilient Cities (100RC)—Pioneered by The Rockefeller 
Foundation. 100RC helps cities around the world build resilience to 
the social, economic, and physical challenges of the 21st century.

A city’s resilience is defined by the ability of the individuals, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within the community to 
survive, adapt, and grow no matter what chronic stress or acute 
shock it experiences. A resilient city lives well in good times 
and bounces back quickly and strongly from hard times. 

The City conducted extensive research that included community outreach 
and engagement to develop a strategy that is designed to advance 
Berkeley’s resilience. Building on existing efforts and with guidance from 
the Mayor, the City Council, and the community, the Berkeley Resilience 
Strategy identifies six long-term goals and recommends specific short-
term actions to help address some of Berkeley’s most pressing challenges. 

Berkeley’s Interconnected Resilience Challenges
Earthquakes

As residents of Berkeley and the Bay Area region well know, one of the 
most pressing challenges we face is natural disasters. Given our proximity 
to several faults, including the Hayward Fault, which runs directly through 
the city, Berkeley is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Current 
Berkeley residents are likely to experience a major earthquake in their 
lifetime. In the event of a major earthquake, over 600 housing units would 
be destroyed and 20,000 more would be damaged. Approximately 3,000 

to 12,000 households would be displaced. Low-income housing units are 
expected to be damaged at the highest rate. Businesses would also be 
destroyed. And the energy and water infrastructure of the various utilities 
would likely be disrupted for several days or weeks. The economic impact 
in Berkeley would be in the billions of dollars, and much more in the region 
as whole. Every aspect of the city, including its people, historic places, 
and economic prosperity, could be quickly and dramatically altered.

Wildfires

Berkeley and the East Bay have a history of destructive wildfire in 
the eastern hills. The wildfire risk in the hills is compounded by the 
area’s narrow streets, which limit access and egress routes. This risk 
was clearly demonstrated in the 1991 Tunnel Fire, which destroyed 
entire neighborhoods in Berkeley and Oakland and took the lives 
of 25 people. In 1923, an even bigger fire burned through Berkeley, 
destroying nearly 600 structures. If a fire burned that same area 
today, approximately 3,000 structures would be destroyed, including 
many small businesses, single-family homes, and apartment buildings, 
particularly buildings that house university students. The risk of wild-
fire is aggravated by California’s severe and prolonged drought. 

Climate Change Impacts: Drought and Flooding

Due to climate change, longer periods of drought are expected to 
be the new normal for our city, region, and state. This Resilience 
Strategy was developed in the midst of one of the most severe, 
multi-year droughts in the state’s history. In addition to increased 
wildfire risk, the impacts of drought include higher food prices and 
significant stress on Berkeley’s urban forest and ecosystems. 

7

INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

On the other end of the spectrum, climate change is also causing more 
frequent and severe flooding, especially in West Berkeley, which is the part 
of the city closest to the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Bay water levels 
are rising and are forecast to continue to increase at an accelerating rate 
throughout the 21st century. In combination with more unpredictable and 
extreme rain events, sea level rise is exacerbating the limits of Berkeley’s 
aging stormwater system, which is degrading due to decades of deferred 
maintenance and repair and is under-capacity for today’s changed climate. 

lifelines in the event of a disaster, but also lead to multi-stakeholder, 
multi-benefit problem solving even under normal circumstances. 

Stronger connections within the community and region are criti-
cal to achieving each of the goals identified in this Strategy:

Goal 1: Build a Connected and 
Prepared Community

Racial Inequity

In addition to physical challenges, Berkeley also 
faces chronic social challenges. For example, 
racial inequity exists in health outcomes, income, 
and educational attainment. Compared to White 
residents, African American residents in Berkeley 
are three times less likely to have a college degree 
and two times more likely to live in poverty. African 
American residents in South and West Berkeley 
have higher rates of childhood asthma hospitaliza-
tions, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, 
and diabetes. Inequity correlates with greater 
vulnerability to physical challenges, making many 
in Berkeley disproportionately at risk from natural 
disasters and the impacts of climate change. 

The approach that this Strategy 
emphasizes is to build com-
munity resilience by building 
stronger connections—stronger 
connections between neigh-
bors; between public, private, 
nonprofit, and academic insti-
tutions; between departments 
within the City government; 
and between Bay Area local 
and regional governments. 

Goal 2: Accelerate Access to  
Reliable and Clean Energy

Goal 3: Adapt to the 
Changing Climate

Goal 4: Advance Racial Equity

Goal 5: Excel at Working  
Together Within City  
Government to Better 
Serve the Community

Building Berkeley’s Resilience through Connectedness

Clearly, these are massive and complex challenges that no one strategy 
can solve. But development and implementation of the Resilience Strategy 
is an opportunity to identify tangible steps that contribute to a solution 
and that emphasize an approach to resilience-building that can be further 
applied by the City and its community partners to other challenges moving 
forward. These connections not only can provide critical support and 

8

Goal 6: Build Regional Resilience

In the spirit of connectedness, the Resilience Strategy is also an 
invitation for all residents and organizations in the city to partner 
with the City government and other community leaders to build 
Berkeley’s resilience together. There is no single action we can take 
that solves all of Berkeley’s challenges, but we can take coordinated, 
multi-disciplinary steps that address more than one challenge at 
once. As you review the goals and actions articulated in this report, 

we invite you to identify opportunities for you to benefit from and 
contribute to the work. We have specifically included “What You Can 
Do” sections throughout the document to stimulate some ideas.  

Moving forward, the City will continue to contribute to and learn 
from the practice of resilience that is being advanced through the 
100RC Network, of which Berkeley is honored to be a part. The 
City will continue to foster partnerships with resilience leaders in 
the region, including the Cities of Oakland and San Francisco and 
the myriad of local resilience champions in our community. 

The City of Berkeley partners with the Berkeley Path Wanderers Association to 
build and maintain walking paths in the eastern hills to assist with firefighting and 
evacuation efforts as well as for recreation. The Berkeley Path Wanderers Asso-
ciation is dedicated to the creation, preservation and restoration of public paths, 
steps and walkways in Berkeley. More info at http://berkeleypaths.org/.  

What you can do

The Resilience Strategy is a product of the Berkeley community 
and its successful implementation rests on community action.

Developing the Strategy

Development and implementation of the Berkeley Resilience Strategy are 
opportunities for the City of Berkeley government (City) and partners 
in the community to research and articulate some of Berkeley’s most 
pressing resilience challenges; identify specific, multi-benefit actions 
that contribute to solutions to those challenges; and secure additional 
resources, technical assistance, and partnerships to accelerate next steps. 

•  Evaluating and documenting gaps in the emergency backup 
power infrastructure for critical City facilities and research-
ing national best practices in advancing energy reliability. 

•  Evaluating the efficacy of existing City disas-

ter preparedness incentive programs. 

The goals and actions identified in the Berkeley Resilience Strategy are 
grounded in community input, expert analysis, and best practices from 
other cities in the global 100 Resilient Cities Network. Approximately 

Approximately 1,100  
community members  
contributed their 
insights and ideas 
to this Strategy

1,100 community members contributed 
their insights and ideas  through a 
combination of an online survey; public 
workshops; City Council meetings; 
City Commission meetings; and events 
hosted by community-based organi-
zations, such as the Berkeley Climate 
Action Coalition. Partner institutions 
and agencies, such as the University of 

California (UC), Berkeley; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL); 
the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG); the San Francisco 
Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC); and the 
Government Alliance on Race and Equity provided invaluable guidance. 

The following research, outreach, and analysis we conducted informed 
the goals and specific actions identified in the Resilience Strategy.

•  Conducting seismic evaluations, economic risk analysis, and en-

ergy and water audits of six City care and shelter facilities. 

•  Analyzing how sea level rise and changing precipitation trends in-

crease flooding and affect Berkeley neighborhoods and infrastructure. 

•  Identifying and evaluating potential additional storm-

water management funding and financing options. 

•  Analyzing options for diversifying the City’s wa-

ter supply in the face of severe drought. 

•  Participating in an international exchange hosted by the City 

of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, focused on learning from 
the world’s leading experts on floodwater management. 

•  Participating in a year-long, action-oriented training focused on 
identifying and eliminating institutional barriers to racial equity. 

•  Collaborating with regional agencies, the Cit-

ies of Oakland and San Francisco, and others to iden-
tify regional resilience-building approaches. 

•  Providing a diverse set of opportunities for com-

munity members to share input. . 

All of this work was conducted with the objective of building or im-
proving connections between individuals and between organizations 
within the community and region and identifying the multi-benefit, 
multi-stakeholder actions that are articulated in the Resilience Strategy.

DEVELOPING THE STRATEGY

The City of Berkeley participated in an international exchange hosted by the

A helpful guide throughout the process was the City Resilience 
Framework. Developed by Arup with support from The Rockefeller 
Foundation, the CRF is being used by cities in the 100RC network to 
guide a common understanding of and approach to the practice of 
building city resilience. It was drafted from extensive empirical research 
conducted globally and is based on four dimensions identified as being 
essential to urban resilience:  Health and Wellbeing, Economy and 
Society, Infrastructure and Environment, and Leadership and Strategy. 
Each of the dimensions is further defined by three drivers of resilience.

For Berkeley, the CRF has proved to be a useful tool for identifying 
actions that have “resilience value,” meaning that they integrate 
multiple interests and areas of expertise, address multiple challenges; 
and create several co-benefits. As you review the goals in the pages 
that follow, note the “resilience value” associated with each.

Building the Bay Area’s Resilience

In 2014, the Cities of Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco 
were three of the first 32 cities selected by The Rockefeller 
Foundation to participate in 100 Resilient Cities (100RC). 

The three cities are unique in many ways, but they also share 
many of the same resilience challenges, including natural 
disasters, the impacts of climate change, aging public infra-
structure, and racial inequity. Together, these cities—along 
with regional agencies, other Bay Area local governments, 
and many private, public, and nonprofit partners—are working 
to address these challenges at a regional level. Participation 
in 100RC has provided added momentum to this work. 

For example, the three cities are contributing to the launch of an 
urban design challenge, based on the work of Rebuild by Design, 
this design competition is a visionary opportunity to make 
the region more resilient to sea level rise, storm surge, urban 
flooding, and seismic events. In partnership with ABAG, the three 
cities are also working to advance coordination between utilities 
and other lifeline agencies through formation of a Regional Life-
lines Council. Learn more about these and other regional efforts 
in Goal #6: Build Regional Resilience, later in this document.

Gathering Public Input on Berkeley’s Resilience Priorities

The City of Berkeley conducted an online survey as one way of gathering community input 
on resilience priorities. The survey was distributed through neighborhood associations, 
business associations, partner institutions, community-based organizations, City 
Council Members and City staff, and other entities that serve the community. 
Over 800 people responded. The graph below shows the number of 
respondents that identified each topic as a priority. Survey 
responses, along with other research and community 
input, helped to inform the goals and actions 
identified in the Resilience Strategy.

Building Berkeley’s Resilience

The Berkeley Resilience Strategy is designed to advance community 
preparedness for some of Berkeley’s most pressing physical, social, and 
economic challenges, examples of which are included in this timeline.  
The Resilience Strategy builds on and dovetails with past  
 

planning efforts that benefited from expert analysis and broad 
community engagement. Moving forward, successful Strategy 
implementation rests on continued community engagement 
and new partnerships that build Berkeley’s resilience.

GOAL 1  |  BUILD A CONNECTED AND PREPARED COMMUNITY

Berkeley is a truly unique community. Its world class academic 
institutions, well-earned reputation for tolerance and inclusiveness, 
vibrant local economy, and access to the broader San Francisco Bay 
Area draw residents and visitors from all over the world. But every 
aspect of the city, including its people, historic places, and economic 
prosperity, could be quickly and dramatically altered by a catastrophic 
disaster, such as an earthquake or wildfire. Although we cannot predict 
when the next disaster will strike, as a community we are empow-
ered to take steps now to reduce the harm disasters can cause.

Fundamental to preparedness is connectedness. The City of Berkeley 
(City) government and its community partners have worked for many 
years to provide incentives and support that advance critical connections 
among neighbors; between public, private, non-profit, and academic 
institutions; and between Bay Area local and regional governments. 
These connections enable everyone in the Berkeley community to 
take part in a coordinated response and recovery effort. Importantly, 
these connections also help to ensure that Berkeley’s most vulnerable 
residents have vital lifelines before, during, and after a disaster.

Through the dedication and relentless focus on disaster readiness that 
many in our community provide, Berkeley is safer and more prepared 
now than ever before. But our work is not done. The actions identified 
below are designed to build on existing efforts and to result not only 
in improved physical safety, but also a more tightly-knit community.  

Resilience value

The actions identified to build a connected and prepared community are 
designed to result in multiple benefits, including improved physical safety, 
which will result in reduced loss of life and injury in the event of a disaster; 
increased social cohesion; increased access to services and assistance for 
historically underserved residents; improved environmental performance of 
critical City facilities; and improved ability to minimize economic disruption. 

What you can do

Actions you can take to help build a connect-
ed and prepared community include:

•  Get to know your neighbors, especially those that 

may need extra assistance in the event of a disaster. 
Organize a block party and invite Berkeley Ready 
staff to provide information on critical steps you and 
your family can take to prepare for emergencies. Visit 
http://cityofberkeley.info/OES  to learn more.

•  Get trained. Invite your friends and neighbors to join you 

in taking a Community Emergency Response Training 
(CERT) class. Visit http://cityofberkeley.info/cert/. 

•  Take advantage of incentives to get connected and pre-
pared. The City offers a free dumpster for the weekend 
for neighborhood groups who have worked together to 
prepare. Visit http://cityofberkeley.info/Dumpster/.  

•  Learn how to find useful information to keep you 

and your loved ones safe during an emergency 
and sign up for alerting systems by visiting http://
cityofberkeley.info/emergencyalerting.

1A. Create safe (and green) 
1A.   Title
City community centers and 
xxx
care & shelter facilities
Action Lead(s)
The City has designated seven community and senior 
•  xxx
centers as care and shelter sites in the event of a 

disaster. These facilities, depending on the scale 

and nature of the event, could provide overnight 

sheltering, food distribution, and other services 

to those in need. These facilities are distributed 

throughout the city and, in addition to their care 

and shelter function, provide essential services on 

a daily basis to thousands of Berkeley residents, 

including seniors and youth, who use these facilities 

for hot meals, recreation, classes, and socializing. 

The facilities are critical to our community, but 

they are also in critical condition. The conclusion 

of the seismic evaluations conducted in 2015 is 

that, in the event of a major earthquake, none of 

these seven facilities would be able to serve its 

daily or disaster functions without significant and 

costly repairs. An analysis by Risk Management 

Solutions (RMS) demonstrated that it is significantly 

more cost-effective to invest in seismic upgrades 

than it is to rebuild or repair structures after an 

earthquake. The City also conducted energy and 

water audits of the facilities and identified cost-ef-

fective energy- and water-saving opportunities.

The City will work with community partners and 

technical assistance providers to make multi-benefit 

seismic, energy, water, and operational upgrades 

to these critical community-serving facilities.

with community partners to identify 
funding and financing to upgrade the 
other six care and shelter facilities. 

1B. Launch the Community Resilience 
Center Program
Recognizing the need to connect more residents 

with disaster preparedness, public health, climate 

action, and other services, the City is partnering 

with several community-based organizations in 

Berkeley to launch the Community Resilience Center 

(CRC) Program. Through the CRC Program, the 

City will provide free disaster supply “caches” and 

disaster planning assistance to community-based 

organizations, such as churches and other faith-based 

groups, youth-empowerment organizations, cultural 

centers, large apartment buildings, and social services 

providers. These community-based organizations 

will be designated as Community Resilience Centers 

and will serve as hosts for training and conduits to 

information and support that is tailored to the needs 

of the people the organizations serve. The City is 

prioritizing partnerships with organizations that 

assist people who are historically underserved. Initial 

CRCs will include (among others) Harriet Tubman 

Terrace, which is an apartment complex that rents 

to low-income seniors and people with disabilities; 

the Ed Roberts Campus, which is dedicated to 

disability rights and universal access; and La Peña 

Cultural Center, which promotes social justice, arts 

participation, and intercultural understanding.

Launch timeline: 2016

1C. Foster neighbor-to-neighbor connec-
tions to advance disaster readiness
Following Berkeley’s next major disaster, such as 

an earthquake or wildfire, government resources 

and assistance may not be available for several 

days. It is therefore essential that neighbors are 

connected to and can support each other before 

and after such an event. Neighbor-to-neighbor 

connections are especially important for socially 

isolated seniors and residents with disabilities. 

In partnership with the nonprofit Berkeley Disaster 

Preparedness Neighborhood Network and local 

community leaders, the City is fostering neighbor-

hood-level connections by identifying Neighborhood 

Disaster Preparedness Liaisons. The liaisons will serve 

as local leaders and organizers within a neighborhood 

and can act as conduits for nearby residents to 

training, information, and other support provided 

by the City government and other organizations.

During Resilience Strategy development, some 

residents expressed frustration about the challenge of 

learning about and connecting with the disaster pre-

paredness leaders and efforts already active in their 

neighborhood. The City is currently researching the 

best ways to connect residents with existing neigh-

borhood leaders and activities. The City is researching 

similar efforts in other cities and will conduct a survey 

of Berkeley residents to help identify next steps.

1F. Continue to improve the seismic 
safety of Berkeley’s most vulner-
able apartment buildings
In the wake of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 

City identified hundreds of wood-frame apartment 

buildings with weak first stories, described as a 

soft, weak, or open-front condition. These weak first 

stories make the structures—and the thousands of 

residents housed in them, many of whom are low-in-

come—extremely vulnerable to earthquakes. Since 

that time, the City has catalyzed seismic retrofits in 

over half of those buildings using incentive programs, 

City ordinances, inspections, and other tools. 

In 2013, the City Council passed a law requiring 

owners of the remaining vulnerable, “soft story” 

buildings to retrofit those structures. Owners of soft 

story properties with five or more dwelling units 

must apply for a building permit by the end of 2016 

and complete the work by December 31, 2018. 

The City works to remove the financial barriers to 

compliance by providing a transfer tax rebate to low-

er the cost of seismic retrofits and access to Property 

Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing, which lets 

owners borrow money with no upfront cost and pay 

the money back at fixed rates on their property tax 

bill. Berkeley pioneered PACE financing in 2008 to 

promote solar energy. PACE has now been expanded 

nationwide and can be used to finance energy- and 

water-efficiency projects as well as seismic retrofits. 

In the future, the City will continue to provide 

a combination of technical assistance, financial

GOAL 2  |  ACCELERATE ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY

It is easy to take for granted the energy we consume. Flip a light switch 
and the light turns on. Many of us have never experienced a prolonged 
power outage that significantly hampers our basic needs. But as was 
made clear by major disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina (2005) 
and Sandy (2012), which disrupted the power grid, loss of power and 
inadequate access to backup power create a cascading set of impacts 
that impede delivery of essential services for people in need, disrupt 
the economy, and hamper disaster recovery. In our city and region, 
earthquakes, wildfires, and other potential disasters present a similar risk.  

The energy grid is also at the nexus of climate change and air pollution. 
Energy consumption in buildings accounts for nearly half of Berkeley’s 
community-wide greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions are affected 
by both the amount and the sources of the energy we consume. 

Berkeley is uniquely capable of taking action that can both advance 
energy reliability and reduce emissions while also keeping more dollars in 
the local economy and creating local jobs in the clean energy and energy 
services sectors. Our community has long been at the forefront of energy 
innovation, including pioneering a new approach to clean energy financing 
and adopting one of the nation’s first ordinances requiring energy audits 
in all building types. We benefit from having two of the nation’s premiere 
research institutions in our backyard—UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory. We also benefit from our active and engaged citizens, 
such as those who participate in the community-led Berkeley Climate 
Action Coalition. Together with these and other partners, the City of 
Berkeley (City) is poised to take action that reduces both our vulnerability 
to disruption of the power grid and our impact on the environment. 

Resilience value

Through the actions identified below, the City will reduce energy 
costs and harmful greenhouse gas emissions while increasing 
green jobs, equitable access to clean energy, and the City’s 
ability to provide critical services in the event of a disaster.

What you can do

Actions you can take to help increase access to reliable 
and clean energy for your home or business include:

•  Save energy and money. Visit http://www.city-
ofberkeley.info/EnergyEfficiencyforHomes/ to 
learn about incentives and assistance available 
to increase your home’s energy efficiency. 

•  Go solar. The nonprofit Community Energy Services 

Corporation provides free, independent guidance 
to help you understand the solar potential of your 
home or business and compare contractor quotes. 
Visit http://ebenergy.org/smart-solar-program/. 

•  Go electric. City staff can provide guidance on steps to take 

to get an electric vehicle.

GOAL 2  |  ACCELERATE ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY

2A. Develop a clean energy 
micro-grid network
A commonly accepted approach to providing emer-

gency backup power is to install a diesel generator at 

vulnerable facilities. This relatively low-cost approach 

is reliable, but the benefit is narrow and has some 

clear downsides, including noise, air pollution, and 

limited capacity to provide power over the course 

of a prolonged outage without reliable access to 

diesel. These downsides make critical facilities 

vulnerable to disruption in the event of a disaster 

and are motivating the City’s pursuit of micro-grids. 

Micro-grids enable a facility or group of facilities 

to operate autonomously when the main grid is 

disrupted; can be powered by clean energy sources, 

such as solar and backup batteries; can be used 

to reduce facilities’ electricity consumption during 

periods of peak demand, when energy prices are 

at their highest; and can enhance the stability of 

the local grid. Unlike a diesel generator, which 

is only used when the grid is disrupted, a clean 

energy micro-grid can provide environmental 

and economic benefits every day, year-round.

Ultimately, the City and its partners seek to develop a 

series of micro-grids that connect multiple public and 

private critical facilities into several networks. The net-

works would have intelligent operating systems with 

the ability to aggregate and share clean energy from 

solar and energy storage batteries across multiple fa-

cilities and to “island” the networked facilities from the 

main grid when power supply is disrupted. The City is 

pursuing funding to pilot this approach in Downtown

2B. Advance clean energy through “Com-
munity Choice Aggregation”   
Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) programs 

allow cities or counties to form a not-for-profit local 

power agency that bundles the buying power of 

residents and businesses to purchase electricity. 

The local power agency can build or fund local 

clean energy projects, buy renewable energy on 

the market, offer energy-efficiency services and 

incentives to customers, and set electricity rates. 

The nearby counties of Marin and Sonoma have 

investment in local clean energy projects that 

could create jobs, greater local control over 

the energy mix used to produce electricity, 

and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. 

Under a CCA, PG&E, the investor-owned utility 

that serves the Bay Area, would continue to 

maintain the power grid, respond to outages, and 

send monthly bills. Customers would have an 

option to continue to purchase power directly 

from PG&E by opting out of the CCA.

Clean Energy (PACE) financing, which was pioneered 

in Berkeley in 2009; expedited solar permitting; and 

the free solar technical assistance that is available 

through the local Smart Solar program. These existing 

efforts, in combination with State-level incentives, 

have catalyzed installation of approximately 1,700 

solar photovoltaic systems in Berkeley between 2000 

and 2015. The Solar Action Plan will prioritize oppor-

tunities to install solar for low-income households 

and will serve as a guide for meeting 50 percent of 

Berkeley’s power demand through solar by 2030.

Electric Vehicles (EVs) emit 70 percent fewer 

greenhouse gas emissions than a conventional 

vehicle with the current PG&E electricity portfolio 

and can reduce greenhouse gases even further as the 

City’s energy becomes cleaner. Berkeley has been a 

leader in advancing EV adoption in the community 

by providing technical assistance and streamlined 

permitting for charging stations and by including 

EV charging readiness as a condition of use permits. 

The City has also installed several public EV charging 

stations and launched a Residential Curbside EV

Berkeley’s Curbside  
Electric Vehicle 
Charging Pilot 
Program

Homes are the most common, 
convenient, and economical place 
to charge an electric vehicle (EV). 
However, for Berkeley residents 
without a driveway, garage, or 
other means of off-street parking, 
home charging is not an option.

The City of Berkeley is testing 
ways to overcome this challenge 
through its Residential Curbside 
Electric Vehicle Charging Pilot 
Program. Launched in 2014, the 
program allows participants to 
either create new space on their 
property for EV charging or to 
install EV charging stations at 
the curb by their home for use 
while parked on the street. 

The pilot program has received 
significant interest from local 
residents and other cities that 
are grappling with the challenge 
of enabling EV adoption for 
more and more residents, 
including those without an 
option to park off the street.

Berkeley and the Bay Area are already experiencing the impacts of climate 
change. San Francisco Bay water levels are rising and are forecast to con-
tinue to do so at an accelerating rate throughout the 21st century. In com-
bination with increasingly unpredictable and extreme rain events, sea level 
rise is exacerbating the limits of Berkeley’s aging stormwater system. The 
result is more frequent and severe flooding, especially in West Berkeley. 

Also driven by climate change, periods of drought are expected to grow 
longer and more severe throughout California. Drought has a range of 
cascading impacts on our community, including stressed urban forests 
and ecosystems, higher food prices, and increased risk of wildfire. 

The consequences of flooding, drought, extreme heat, and other climate 
impacts are not only physical, but also social and economic. Many in the 
Berkeley community, based on factors such as income and the neigh-
borhood in which they live or work, are disproportionately vulnerable.

Preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change require 
creating and activating strategies that respond to both current 
and future risk. Berkeley must embrace and implement innovative, 
multi-benefit solutions in resource management, urban planning, and 
infrastructure design. For example, our stormwater management 
infrastructure must be reimagined as a system that conveys storm-
water to reduce flooding, filters it to protect our creeks and the Bay, 
and captures it for use or to recharge aquifers, which is especially 
important because we expect to experience more drought. Berkeley 
is already investing in green infrastructure projects that incorporate 
both natural and engineered elements to create benefits beyond basic 
flood management. The changing climate requires that we do more.   

GOAL 3  |  ADAPT TO THE CHANGING CLIMATE

Resilience value

The actions identified in this section will advance Berkeley’s preparedness 
for the impacts of climate change, help residents and businesses that are 
most vulnerable to flooding and drought, and protect local ecosystems.

What you can do

Actions you can take to help our community pre-
pare for the impacts of climate change include:

•  Get involved. The Berkeley Climate Action Coalition 
is a network of local community-based organizations 
and residents that work together to take action on 
climate change. The coalition works on specific proj-
ects to help our community save energy and water, 
increase recycling, and adapt to the changing climate. 
Visit http://ecologycenter.org/climatecoalition/.  

•  Save water. Free incentives and assistance exist to 
help you conserve water at home and save money 
on your utility bill. Visit http://www.ebmud.com/

GOAL 3  |  ADAPT TO THE CHANGING CLIMATE

In the future, the City will identify new opportunities 

to increase investment in GI. Increasing the scale 

of this work will require an integrated approach 

to infrastructure planning and design that enables 

the City to address decades of deferred street and 

stormwater system maintenance and repair while 

also achieving other benefits that help Berkeley adapt 

to changing climate conditions. To guide this work, 

the City will build on the Watershed Management 

Plan and Measure M implementation by developing a 

next-phase, comprehensive Stormwater Master Plan. 

This plan will be the result of extensive collaboration 

and analysis and will identify, evaluate, and prioritize 

stormwater system repairs, upgrades, and multi-ben-

efit GI projects throughout the city. The plan will also 

identify necessary funding and financing options.

water supply
This first-ever Berkeley Resilience Strategy was 

Green infrastructure is creating multiple benefits in 
Berkeley. Example Berkeley projects include perme-
able pavement in streets (above) and rain gardens 
within traffic circles. Berkeley community members 
have provided extensive input on prioritizing green 
infrastructure projects throughout the city.

3A. Integrate multi-benefit 
green infrastructure into street 
improvement projects 
Green infrastructure (GI) is one of the best examples 

of resilience in practice. Unlike conventional storm-

water infrastructure, GI can create multiple benefits 

beyond flood mitigation, including protecting ecosys-

tems by removing pollutants, beautifying a neighbor-

hood, and, potentially, enabling the capture and use 

of stormwater for other purposes. Examples of GI in-

clude rain gardens, permeable pavement, and cisterns.

GI projects are being implemented more and more 

often across Berkeley thanks to both private and 

public funding. The City of Berkeley (City) requires 

applicable private development to include GI in 

new construction, which is resulting in many GI 

installations. Measure M bond funding, approved 

developed during one of the most severe, multi-

and region. Transitioning to this new normal and 

continuing to flourish in a drier climate require that 

our community continue to conserve water and 

treat it as the valuable, scarce resource that it is and 

innovate and diversify Berkeley’s water supply. 

The City relies on the East Bay Municipal Utility 

District (EBMUD) for its water supply. The water 

supply begins at the Mokelumne River watershed 

in the Sierra Nevada and extends 90 miles to the 

East Bay. The consistency of the water supply 

is highly dependent on the snow pack. During 

prolonged drought, reduced snow pack levels 

correlate to a diminished water supply for EBMUD 

customers. The City is analyzing several opportu-

nities for water supply diversification, including: 

•  In partnership with the University of Cal-

ifornia (UC), Berkeley, Climate Readiness 

Institute, examining the feasibility of uti-

lizing accessible groundwater sources as 

backup water supply or to irrigate parks. 

•  Initiating an analysis of the potential to

3C. Create the landscape of the future
In response to severe drought, the City reduced 

water consumption in municipal operations by 

over 40 percent between 2013 and 2015, saving 

approximately 35 million gallons of water and 

$200,000 in utility costs per year. The City achieved 

these results mainly by reducing irrigation and fixing 

needed to transport and process waste. 

To continue to adapt to changing climate conditions, 

the City will work with partners in the community, 

including local neighborhood and business associ-

ations, to replace unnecessary water-intensive turf 

with drought-tolerant alternatives and upgrade 

irrigation technology and equipment. The City is 

also working to supplement these water-saving 

efforts by diversifying its non-potable water supply.

3D. Integrate consideration of climate im-
pacts into capital and land use planning 

Capital and land use planning efforts can no 

longer be based on the climate of the past. 

Instead, urban design and development must 

be informed by the latest climate science to 

determine how to best protect and modify existing 

public and private infrastructure and assets and 

how to design new infrastructure and assets.  

Our neighbor, the City and County of San Francisco, 

is providing important leadership and tools for 

incorporating sea level rise into capital planning. In 

collaboration with San Francisco and other academic, 

government, non-governmental organization (NGO), 

and private-sector partners in the region, Berkeley 

will work to incorporate consideration of sea level rise 

and other climate impacts into public infrastructure 

and asset design and land use planning and site 

development standards for private assets. Ultimately, 

based on ongoing review of climate science and 

associated vulnerability assessments, the City will 

develop guidance for City departments and private 

developers on how to understand and incorporate the 

potential range of climate impacts that could occur 

within the project’s planning horizon and beyond.

Racial equity will be achieved when race can no longer be used to predict 
life outcomes. The City of Berkeley government (City) and all local govern-
ments have a responsibility to identify and eliminate institutional barriers 
to racial equity. Although the City alone cannot eliminate racial inequity, 
proactive City leadership has the potential to support significant change. 

With the support, encouragement, and advocacy of many organizations 
in our community, the City is committed to ensuring that racial equity is 
reflected throughout City policies and practices and is reinforced at all 
levels of the City organization. We do not start from scratch. The City’s 
Human Resources department already implements staff trainings focused 
on understanding and advancing the value of diversity and on integrating 
racial equity into hiring and promotional practices. The Berkeley Police 
Department, one of the most representatively diverse police departments 
in the United States, trains its officers to eliminate implicit bias. The 
Health, Housing, and Community Services Department has identified 
and publicized race-based health inequities for Berkeley residents and is 
working toward equal health opportunities for all. The goal of eradicating 
racial inequities informs much of the City’s outreach and services related 
to improving disaster preparedness and educational achievement.

The City and its partners are making progress, but much work 
remains to be done. The actions identified below reflect the 
City’s commitment to creating institutional change and advanc-
ing a collective racial equity agenda on a community scale.

In 2008, a multi-agency partnership was formed in 

Berkeley with the aim of ending the racial predict-

Berkeley Public Schools. Called the 2020 Vision, the 

partnership is working to achieve academic success 

and well-being for all children and youth growing 

up in Berkeley by closing the achievement gap in 

Berkeley’s public schools by the year 2020. The 

partnership includes the City, the Berkeley Unified 

School District, the Berkeley Alliance, UC Berkeley, 

Berkeley City College, the YMCA, and many other 

members of the Berkeley community. The 2020 

Vision is a clear acknowledgment by leading 

Berkeley organizations that racial inequity persists 

in our community, and that it is unacceptable. 

As it works to advance racial equity within its own 

organization, the City will build on existing efforts 

such as the 2020 Vision to create new structures 

and partnerships to help promote a collective 

racial equity agenda in the community. Priorities for 

the City and its partners moving forward include 

expanding services for families with children 0 to 3 

years old to better prepare children for kindergarten 

and developing improved college and career 

readiness strategies for high-school-aged youth.

GOAL 5  |  EXCEL AT WORKING TOGETHER WITHIN CITY GOVERNMENT TO BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY

The goals and actions identified in the Resilience Strategy meet some of 
Berkeley’s most pressing challenges head-on, including preparing for natu-
ral disasters, upgrading aging infrastructure, adapting to climate change, 
and advancing racial equity. Although the City of Berkeley government 
(City) is certainly not the only entity in the community that has a 
role in addressing these big challenges, it must provide vision 
and effective leadership. The City must continue to break down 
traditional governmental “silos” and integrate the expertise and 
knowledge within City departments and divisions to implement 
solutions that engage and create multiple benefits for many peo-
ple. The actions identified below are the practical next steps that 
the City will take to excel at providing the leadership necessary 
to take on some of the community’s most pressing challenges. 

Resilience value

Through the actions identified here, the City will improve access 
to services for all residents; further integrate sustainability and equity 
throughout City operations; improve City government efficiency 
through increased multi-disciplinary, multi-departmental collaboration; 
and deepen community engagement in local decision-making.

In 2015, the City of 
Berkeley held a 

friendly compe-

which represents 
the commitment 
of City employees

The City is launching a strategic planning process to 

better articulate the long-term goals that the City 

will work to achieve in service to the community and 

the short-term priority projects designed to achieve 

those goals. The Berkeley Strategic Plan will serve

information in the event of a disaster and better track 

and manage disaster recovery operations. Effective 

tracking and documentation of disaster recovery 

activities and expenditures are critical for enabling 

recovery of those costs from the Federal government 

in the event of a federally declared disaster.

The City of Berkeley (City) is one of 101 cities in the San Fran-
cisco Bay Area. The region spans approximately 6,900 square 
miles of land and is home to over 7.5 million people. 

Each of the Bay Area cities has qualities that make it unique, in-
cluding its culture, food, topography, and politics. But Bay Area 
cities also share many qualities in common, not least of which are 
the physical, social, and economic challenges that Berkeley’s Re-
silience Strategy is designed to address. Natural disasters, climate 
change impacts, aging public infrastructure, racial inequity—these 
challenges are not confined within the boundaries of any one city. 

At times it may be tempting or feel easier for cities to take on these 
challenges in isolation. But identifying solutions that match the scale 
of the challenges we face requires regional coordination. Regional 
coordination has the potential to increase the reach of good ideas and 
increase the influence of cities’ concerns and needs. Because cities 
are interdependent and frequently share resources, each city stands 
to benefit when the region as a whole becomes more resilient. 

100 Resilient Cities (100RC)—Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, 
knew well the value of regional approaches to problem solving when 
it selected Berkeley, San Francisco, and Oakland as three of the first 
32 cities to participate in 100RC. The 100RC program also provided 
support to the region’s Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) 
to help spread lessons from the three cities’ resilience planning efforts 
and to contribute to a collective resilience agenda at a regional scale.

The actions identified 
here promote long-term 
integrated planning to 
better prepare the region 
for climate change impacts, 
natural disasters, and other 
challenges; empower cities and the 
communities they serve to collectively 
advocate for the resources needed to 
effectively build the region’s resilience; and foster partnerships between 
public agencies, private-sector entities, lifeline agencies, and communi-
ty-based organizations to develop and implement innovative solutions.

GOAL 6  |  BUILD REGIONAL RESILIENCE

6A. Develop and launch a regional 
Resilience by Design Challenge
The City is contributing to the development and 

launch of a regional urban planning and design 

competition. The Resilience by Design Challenge 

(the Challenge) will unite multi-disciplinary teams of 

architecture, landscape, urban design, ecology, and 

finance experts with community members and local 

and regional government leaders to identify inno-

vative, actionable urban design solutions that help 

prepare the region for the impacts of climate change. 
The Challenge is an opportunity to elevate 
the public dialogue regarding our rapidly 
changing climate and to develop multi-benefit 
solutions that improve our communities. 

Multi-disciplinary design teams from around 
the world will be invited to apply to partici-
pate. Selected teams will conduct intensive 
research of existing conditions, challenges, 
and opportunities and will then work with local 
government and community stakeholders to 
develop design solutions that will help commu-
nities adapt to and prepare for the impacts of 
climate change, such as flooding and drought. 
A jury will review the teams’ final designs and 
select winners. Local government partners will 
work with selected teams to develop project 
implementation plans and funding sources. 
The outcome of the Challenge will be a set 
of robust design solutions that make our 
communities and our region more resilient.

Department; and Chief Resilience Officers 
of Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco

Partner(s): Bay Area local 
governments and communities 

Launch timeline: 2016

6B. Launch a regional Sustainable Water 
Summit 
As a result of climate change, periods of drought 

are expected to become longer and more severe in 

California. This challenge is exacerbated by a growing 

population—the Bay Area is expected to grow by ap-

proximately 2 million residents over the next 25 years.

Berkeley and other Bay Area communities are taking 

steps to improve their water conservation efforts and 

diversify their water supply. To help accelerate, align, 

and increase the scale of existing efforts, the City 

will contribute to convening a regional Sustainable 

Water Summit, which will focus on identifying 

strategies for the long-term, sustainable management 

of water resources. With coordinating assistance 

from ABAG, the summit will involve participation by 

public, private, non-profit, and academic entities.

Action lead(s): ABAG
Partner(s): The Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA), City of Berkeley 
and other Bay Area local governments, 
Bay Area academic institutions, water 
utilities, community-based organizations, 
foundations and other funding agencies 

Launch timeline: 2016

6C. Establish a Regional Lifelines Council
Lifelines are the energy, water, transportation, and 

communications systems that are part of the fabric 

of our communities. These systems are essential for 

daily life and disaster response and recovery, but they 

are also vulnerable to disruption from earthquake, 

wildfire, and other shocks. The agencies that own 

and operate lifeline services in the Bay Area, such 

as water and energy utilities, the San Francisco Bay 

Area Rapid Transit District (BART), and others, are 

making significant strides in designing, constructing, 

and upgrading critical facilities to reduce risk. 

To accelerate and align these efforts, the City is 

contributing to the efforts of ABAG to design and 

launch a Regional Lifelines Council (Council). The 

Council will be made up of representatives from 

lifeline agencies, local governments, and non-govern-

mental organizations (NGOs). The Council will enable 

improved communication and collaboration, shared 

disaster response and recovery planning. The Council 

will also develop and implement clearly defined, 

coordinated processes for restoring lifeline 

systems as quickly as possible after a disaster.

6D. Catalyze investment in the 
region’s public infrastructure
The City, like many cities, is faced with the chal-

lenge of how to identify the tens of millions of 

dollars necessary to upgrade and maintain aging, 

degrading public infrastructure. Streets, sidewalks, 

stormwater systems, parks, and community-serving 

facilities are in need of repair and renovation 

to continue to effectively serve their functions. 

This challenge is exacerbated by the impacts of 

climate change, such as flooding due to sea level 

rise, and natural disasters, such as earthquakes. 

The City will work with ABAG, the Cities of 

Oakland and San Francisco, and other Bay Area 

local governments and organizations to catalyze 

development of a regional infrastructure finance 

agenda that can attract additional, much-needed 

public and private investment. Collectively, Bay 

Area cities can articulate the scale of the need 

for additional infrastructure investment—and the 

6D

ordinances for encouraging or requiring upgrades 

to the region’s most vulnerable building stock. 

Effective policies developed at the regional level can 

affect action throughout the state and beyond.

6E. Form regional alliances for policy 
advocacy
A single jurisdiction cannot on its own effectively 

adapt to sea level rise, improve the regional 

transportation network, respond to drought, 

prepare for and recover from a disaster, take on 

the affordable housing challenge, and develop the 

region’s economy of the future. Given the regional 

nature of many of the Bay Area’s most-pressing 

challenges and most-effective solutions, the City 

is committed to continuing to participate in and 

elevate action-oriented regional collaboration. 

Tangible opportunities to advance regional coor-

dination include partnering with the other 100RC 

network cities in the region and state—the Cities of 

Oakland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles—to share 

lessons learned in resilience planning with other 

Bay Area and California cities and continuing to 

participate in ABAG’s East Bay Corridor Initiative, 

which is a platform for developing common policies 

and practices among East Bay cities. Given the 

risk of earthquake in the East Bay, to date the East
