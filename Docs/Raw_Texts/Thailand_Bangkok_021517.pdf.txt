BANGKOK

LETTER 
FROM THE 
GOVERNOR

For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in 
rural areas. In the past, cities have been living laboratories for 
major political, social, economic, scientific and technological 
changes, which have given rise to opportunities for human 
progress in many areas. People have flocked to cities, 
attracted by the promise of opportunities and in search of a 
better life. 

Nowhere is this more true than in Bangkok. The heart 
of Thailand, Bangkok plays a central role in national life 
and is almost 40 times larger than the next largest city in 
the country.  Almost all of our country’s very substantial 
industrialisation during the last three decades has taken place 
in our city and its surroundings. Bangkok’s urban primacy has 
brought, and continues to bring, its residents and the country 
many opportunities. With such a central and prominent role in 
the nation’s life, Bangkok must succeed. By 2020 the lives of a 
projected 15 million residents will depend on it.  

To succeed to 2020 and beyond, Bangkok and its residents 
must be prepared to face the many shocks and stresses 
that will continue to challenge our resilience. Rapid and 
widespread growth has us grappling with increasing 
urbanization. Facilitating mobility for all our residents in 
our sprawling city and catering for the social and economic 
needs, and health and wellbeing of our diverse and rapidly 
growing population, including the poor and vulnerable, are all 
significant challenges. 

By virtue of our location in the central region of Thailand, 
on the low lying plains of the Chao Phraya River, flooding is 
common in Bangkok. With climate change, population growth 

22

and increasing population density, learning to live with water 
in new and different ways is one of our most urgent tasks, 
along with conserving the natural environment on which all 
life in our city depends. 

Given the scope and severity of these resilience challenges, 
we cannot implement sustainable and long lasting resilience 
solutions on our own. To provide our city and its residents 
with the opportunities, security and quality of life they long 
for and deserve, we need all our city organisations, and 
residents to work together towards shared priorities.

Only through united effort can we navigate both the shocks 
and stresses we currently face, and those that loom on the 
horizon. This Resilience Strategy outlines these priorities. 
It is a collection of responses to our most important issues 
and a call to action to our city to get involved in their 
implementation. 

In today’s world, cooperation within cities, as well as between 
cities, government authorities and regional and international 
organisations is critical. This Strategy would not have been 
possible without the inspiration and support of 100 Resilient 
Cities, Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, and the 
shared experience and learnings of our peers in the 100 
Resilient Cities Network. We believe strongly that cooperation 
with others is the key to finding and implementing sustainable 
solutions that will not only build resilience for this generation, 
but for generations to come.  

We are proud to take our first steps on our resilience journey. 
As we set out on this journey, this Strategy will be our 
map; our peers on the 100 Resilient Cities Network and 100 
Resilient Cities, our trusted travel companions and allies. 
Together, we will move forward each day towards a city that is 
safe, liveable and sustainable for all.

LETTER FROM 
MICHAEL  
BERKOWITZ

PRESIDENT | 100 RESILIENT CITIES 

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to 
congratulate the city of Bangkok, former Governor Mom 
Rajawongse Sukhumbhand Paribatra and Governor Pol Gen 
Aswin Kwanmuang on the release of the city’s resilience 
strategy. A thriving modern metropolis, Bangkok is also a city 
that cherishes its traditions, with the two coexisting along its 
storied river and canals.  This document honours the vibrant 
future of both and lays out an extraordinary vision of urban 
resilience for the residents and neighbourhoods of the entire 
Bangkok Metropolitan Area. 

Since its early beginnings as the capital of Thailand over 250 
years ago, Bangkok has become the beating heart of the 
country and a major hub for commerce and culture across 
Asia. As the city continues to adapt to its rapid urbanization 
and unparalleled growth, this strategy sets out a clear 
vision for the way forward, enabling the city to thrive rather 
than merely survive its various challenges. This document 
addresses not only the shocks posed by floods and other 
disasters; it also provides plans for strengthening the city 
amid its myriad stresses caused by its continuing expansion. 
The strategy includes plans for the city’s transportation 
system, provision of city services, and preserving traditional 
agriculture. It also emphasizes plans for improving the 
quality of life of all citizens, including and especially its aging 
population, reducing risks posed by floods and other natural 
disasters, and building a strong and competitive economy. 

While flooding continues to present a major risk, Bangkok 
has renewed its relationship with the Chao Phraya and the 
threats it poses. Rather than focusing its resilience strategy 
on preparing for major floods, the city has brought a forward-
looking balance to its plans, one that accepts water as an 
integral part of the city’s future, rather than merely a threat 

to it. In this way, and many others, the strategy is designed 
to turn Bangkok’s challenges into opportunities for a more 
resilient future.  

Through his energetic leadership in Bangkok, and the 100RC 
network, Dr. Supachai Tantikom, the city’s Chief Resilience 
Officer, has guided the city to this major moment.  The release 
of Bangkok’s strategy is an important milestone for advancing 
the city’s resilience and strengthening the capacity of the 
city and its partners for coordination, collaboration, and 
innovation. Importantly, the strategy reflects many lessons 
learned from the 100RC network and emphasizes further 
collaboration. 

Though this strategy represents the end of the strategic 
planning process in Bangkok, it is only the beginning of 
the exciting work to come in the months and years ahead. 
And 100 Resilient Cities’ partnership with the city is also 
just beginning. It is now that we can collectively begin 
implementing the actions and initiatives contained in the 
following pages, which will positively impact the lives of all 
of those who call Bangkok home, and its many visitors. From 
its engagement with world–class service providers through 
the 100 Resilient Cities platform of partners, to its active 
engagement with the network, Bangkok is well positioned to 
help us in leading the global urban resilience revolution. We at 
100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to be a partner 
in these efforts.

Congratulations again on this enormous achievement, and 
we look forward to our continued partnership in the journey 
ahead.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYLETTER FROM THE 
CHIEF RESILIENCE 
OFFICER

First and most foremost, I would like to thank all of the 
passionate, professional and dedicated individuals and 
organisations that have contributed their time and forward 
thinking to the Bangkok Resilience Strategy. 
In particular, I would like to thank the esteemed members of 
our Steering Committee, the Bangkok Resilience Strategy 
Working Teams and our Strategy Partner, AECOM for helping 
to make this Strategy everything that it is. I would like that 
thank former Governor Mom Rajawongse Sukhumbhand 
Paribatra for bringing this opportunity to Bangkok and 
to Governor Pol Gen Aswin Kwanmuang for carrying this 
strategy, and the program of activity it outlines, forward.

We are grateful to 100 Resilient Cities for providing us 
with this opportunity to expand our horizons and for their 
constant and steadfast support in our resilience journey so 
far. Participation in the 100 Resilient Cities Network has been 
invaluable to the development of this Strategy. Our peers on 
the network have taught us much. I hope that this Strategy 
speaks to the many lessons we have learned. 

Bangkok is a city of contrasts. For the most part, Bangkok 
is a vivid, fast-paced metropolis, bursting with modern life. 
It draws people in from all over the country and the region, 
in search of education, economic opportunity and a higher 
quality of life. But look again and you will see a city steeped in 
tradition. Historic buildings and temples allude to deep rooted 
customs. 

Unprecedented changes have taken place within Bangkok 
in the last decade and this pace of change shows no sign of 
slowing down. While rapid growth and industrial success has 
lifted millions in our city from poverty, such development has 
not been universal. Massive migration to Bangkok by people 
seeking better livelihood options has resulted in areas of 
inevitable poverty. Amongst the glittering new condominiums 
there remain areas of unplanned informal settlements where 
people live and work, which are unsafe and put people at risk.  

Increasing urbanization has created a busy and stressful 
lifestyle, congested streets and poor water and air quality. 
Our natural environment and the health of our residents have 
suffered with ever-expanding development. Such challenges 

44

will only be compounded by climate change, which will bring 
increasing uncertainty and unplanned interruption to our city.     

With more people than ever before living in, and engaging 
with our city, it is a critical time for us to break the cycle 
of reacting to problems and set out on a more deliberate 
course to ensure that our city is resilient. Only by preparing 
Bangkokians, our communities, institutions, businesses and 
systems to survive, adapt and grow no matter what kind of 
chronic stresses and acute shocks we experience, can we 
bring our city closer to our vision of a city that is safe, liveable 
and sustainable for all. We must work to improve social 
services and mobility for all residents. We must ensure no one 
is left behind, for to be successful, we must lift everyone up.  

To do this, we have identified three Strategic Action Areas. 
Each is underpinned by a number of important goals, which 
are supported by a suite of initiatives and projects. These 
Strategic Action Areas focus on increasing quality of life, 
reducing risk and increasing adaptation and driving a strong 
and competitive economy. A significant challenge for us is to 
reimagine fundamental problems in our city, such as traffic 
congestion and flooding, in new and creative ways. In doing 
so, we will adapt, learn and grow with our environment whilst 
ensuring that we won’t make the mistakes of the past.  

No longer is it enough for us to only protect Bangkok from 
flooding, with a changing climate and increasing urban 
development managing floods will only become more 
complex. Instead, we must harness water in the city for life 
and liveability. Our new approach to water management will 
use green and blue infrastructure – parks and canals, as much 
as it uses the traditional protection of grey infrastructure 
– pipes and pumps. This will provide multiple benefits for 
Bangkok, including contributing towards our goal of growing 
green space and encouraging environmentally friendly 
urbanization.   

I am honoured to be able to present Bangkok’s first Resilience 
Strategy, what I hope will be the first of many. This Strategy 
belongs to all Bangkokians. I hope that it can catalyse new 
ideas and inspire all of us to work together to build resilience 
now and into the future.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBANGKOK

EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY

Unprecedented changes over the last decade 
have rendered Bangkok, at first glance, almost 
unrecognizable. Rapid growth and industrial success 
has made the city a magnet for migration from across 
the country and beyond. Millions of people flock to 
‘the city of angels’ in search of opportunity amidst 
the concentration of economic growth and prosperity; 
Bangkok’s population has increased more in the last 
decade than the preceding three decades combined. 
Alongside newfound opportunity, this growth has 
brought myriad social, economic and environmental 
challenges. 

With more people than ever before living in and 
engaging with the city, it is a critical time to look 
ahead and make a plan for a better, more resilient 
Bangkok. One that is safe, liveable and sustainable 
for all. How can we make Bangkok a vibrant city of 
opportunity for everyone, rather than a select few? 
How can we create space for collaboration and 
communities, rather than of division and exclusion? 
How can we work together to embrace water and its 
opportunities and values, rather than battle to keep it 
out? These and many more questions were asked in 
the development of this Resilient Bangkok Strategy. 
While the pages that follow do not provide a single 
and absolute solution, they do outline a series of steps 
that will bring us closer to our goal.

66

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYTogether with 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the 
Rockefeller Foundation, the Bangkok Metropolitan 
Administration is proud to present this Resilient Bangkok 
Strategy. The pages that follow outline what we have found 
to be the most urgent threats to Bangkok’s resilience and 
the integrated and participatory actions that we will take to 
address them. Our actions will focus on three, interconnected 
Strategic Action Areas. These are: 

INCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE

REDUCING RISK AND INCREASING ADAPTATION 

DRIVING A STRONG AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMY 

Each Strategic Action Area comprises a number of goals 
and each goal has a range of initiatives with specific, 
implementable projects. A summary of all Strategic Action 
Areas is provided on page 37 and all goals, initiatives and 
projects are summarized on page 14-116.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBANGKOK

INCREASING QUALITY         
OF LIFE 

REDUCING RISK AND 
INCREASING ADAPTATION 

Bangkok supports over 8 million people in the city, 
and over 14 million in its metropolitan area, who 
travel to and from work, access healthcare, and 
partake in entertainment and recreation. To ensure 
that our residents can experience an increased 
quality of life, we will work to improve social 
services and mobility for all residents. 

Climate change, urbanization and globalization will bring 
increasing uncertainty and unplanned interruption to 
Bangkok. By supporting and strengthening community-led 
disaster risk reduction actions and increasing institutional 
adaptive capacity, we will support all of Bangkok’s residents 
to better adapt to natural and human hazards and the 
increasing risks posed by climate change. 

This Strategic Action Area has three goals: 

This Strategic Action Area has three goals: 

• 

• 

Improving resilience to floods 

Increasing public and community-driven action on 
awareness, preparedness and adaptation; and 

• 

Stronger institutional capacity and regulation. 

While identifying and planning for foreseeable risks is an 
important part of disaster risk reduction, we will also build 
resilience in our communities so that they can withstand a 
range of shocks and stresses, even those that are unforeseen. 

•  Health and wellbeing for all city residents, now 

and into the future 

• 

Safe, accessible and convenient transportation 
network; and  

• 

Environmentally friendly urbanization.

Ensuring our healthcare and facilities meet the 
evolving needs of an ageing population will be 
central to achieving our goals. We will work to 
promote and facilitate the benefits of a healthy 
lifestyle, through infrastructure change and 
engagement with the community. We will improve 
mobility and connectivity through actions that will 
contribute to a safe, accessible and convenient 
transportation network and promote green space 
in urban areas to make the city a more pleasant 
and accessible place to live and work.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBangkok has come a long way since it became the capital 
of Thailand in 1782. The past 250 years has seen the city 
change from a small fortress town on the eastern bank of 
the Chao Phraya River into one of South East Asia’s most 
prosperous and modern cities. But while history has been 
kind to the city, it has also been cruel. Bangkok has faced, and 
will continue to struggle with severe financial crises, floods, 
political unrest and other significant disruptions amidst the 
slow burning stress caused by increasing inequality and 
rampant urbanization. Such challenges have often left the 
city struggling to catch up. This strategy marks an important 
step forward for Bangkok. We are well and truly into the 21st 
century now. Perhaps lessons from the 21st century tell us that 
change and growth will be unparalleled, but we will not be 
scrambling to catch up, instead we will be well ahead.   

DRIVING A STRONG AND 
COMPETITIVE ECONOMY 

Bangkok’s economy is inextricably connected to the global 
economy, bringing opportunities for economic diversity and 
growth through trade, tourism, and investment. Increasing 
interconnections and interdependencies also introduce 
significant volatility and vulnerability into our economy. While 
the city cannot shield itself entirely from this volatility, there 
is much that can be done to ensure our economy is strong, 
efficient, accessible, and competitive. We will drive a strong 
and competitive economy through economic diversification, 
both in terms of industries and in employment opportunities 
for our residents. 

This Strategic Action Area has two goals: 

• 

• 

Facilitating city and community-based economy; and 

Expanding tourism, service industry and hospitality. 

To achieve these goals we will work to cultivate our world-
renowned tourism and service industries by developing a 
roadmap for our tourism sector and by supporting tourism 
providers with business development training. We will explore 
opportunities for technological advancement, which can 
facilitate higher skilled and higher paying jobs and support a 
diverse range of community-based livelihoods.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBANGKOK

BRIEF 
HISTORY

Bangkok, or Krung Thep Mahanakorn in Thai, means the 
City of Angels. Its full name is Krung Thep Mahanakhon 
Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Ayuthaya Mahadilok 
Phop Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet 
Mahasathan Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya 
Witsanukam Prasit. It is Thailand’s capital and the national 
centre of administration, education, transportation, finance 
and commence and development. 
 
Once known as the “Venice of the East”, Bangkok became 
the capital of Thailand in 1782 after re-establishment on 
the eastern bank of the Rattanakosin Island. Originally 
located on around 4 square kilometres of the eastern 
bank of the mighty Chao Phraya River in central Thailand, 
Bangkok’s natural settings have always been a central 
feature of its form and mobility. Central Thailand is 
known for its flat and fertile plains which are reliant on 
natural and man-made waterways to irrigate and drain 
farmland during dry and green seasons. This centuries-
old relationship with water, as the source of life and 
livelihoods, means the city is no stranger to floods and 
the disruption caused by severe weather, which is now 
intensified with climate change.  

1010

BRIEF HISTORYEARLY CITY STRUCTURE AND 
PLANNING

Canals were used as a planning tool and were a central part of 
urban land use planning policy during the period of  
King Rama I. The city was divided into three parts by the 
canals: inner Bangkok, outer Bangkok, and the area outside 
the city wall. People settled along both sides of the river and 
developed an extensive network of canals as their main mode 
of transport. To this day, thousands of people get around 
the city using an extensive network of large and small river 
and canal boats. Freight is transported up the Chao Phraya 
to Northern provinces, and down to the Gulf of Thailand on 
barges. The importance of roads in attracting national and 
global investment emerged in 1851, led by King Rama IV, with 
rail and tram transport connecting Bangkok to neighbouring 
areas.

Over the next century Bangkok’s development accelerated, 
attracting people from across Asia to live and work together, 
building over fields and canals in the process, to create one 
of the world’s largest and most dynamic city hubs.  The city’s 
rapid growth and industrial success has made it a magnet for 
migration from across the country and beyond, marking the 
beginning of a trend of rapid urbanization, which to this day, 
shows no signs of slowing down.

BRIEF HISTORYINFLUENCE OF TRADE

Western trade has had a big influence on the growth 
of Bangkok. Thailand has a long history of agricultural 
production, trading with the West and China to become a 
world centre for rice and rubber. In the 20th Century, the 
Chao Phraya and its delta developed quickly to support 
port facilities, warehouses, shipyards, and rice mills; all built 
by thousands of labourers. Over the decades and with the 
influence of globalization, Thailand has grown its export 
industries beyond agricultural products to include vehicles, 
electronics, heavy and light machinery, plastics and refined 
petroleum to become one of the major exporting countries in 
the region and the 22nd largest exporter in the world.
 
Now Bangkok is a thriving commercial hub supported 
by world-class government infrastructure including two 
international airports, stadia, numerous beautifully designed 
bridges, and mass transport systems. Bangkok is studded with 
stunning temples and palaces, traditional markets and houses, 
and still supports ancient crafts and a food culture that is 
unparalleled. Its unique blend of ancient and modern ways of 
life creates a bustling and fascinating city.

BRIEF HISTORYCITY IMPORTANCE AND 
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL 
CONTEXT 

Despite its short history in comparison to other globally 
important cities, the Bangkok Metropolitan Area has quickly 
burgeoned to a vast sprawling megacity over 1568 square 
kilometres, hosting over 14 million people. Bangkok’s role 
and importance as a primate city in comparison to Thailand’s 
other cities is unparalleled in Asia. Over a fifth of Thailand’s 
population and the vast majority of the nation’s financial, 
commercial and government responsibility is concentrated 
there. 

Thailand has demonstrated 
remarkable economic progress 
experiencing 21 per cent growth in 
Foreign Direct Investment inflows 
over the past 6 years, compared 
to the global percentage of 0.7%. 
Occupying the 4th rank in Asia’s 
top prospective host economies, 
Thailand has gained a solid reputation 
as a second home for various global 
multinational enterprises (MNEs).

BRIEF HISTORY   BANGKOK

Bangkok’s strategic role as capital and driver of Thailand’s 
national economy, along with an industrial centre on the 
Eastern Seaboard, gives it regional as well as national 
importance. Its location and facilities provide attractive 
opportunities for companies to invest and workers to settle. 
This migration from across the world, neighbouring countries 
and Thai provinces gives Bangkok its unique, multicultural 
diversity and dynamism. 

The rapid growth of the city, and its changing role within 
Thailand, Asia and the world, has not been without its 
challenges. Some areas of the city have experienced intense, 
unplanned urban growth and an unsustainable increase in 
population density. Due to this, authorities struggle to provide 
sufficient public services and ensure compliance to safety 
and land use regulation. Programs for upgrading public 
infrastructure, regenerating housing, reforming land tenure 
and documenting migrants have helped to rectify many areas 
of risk in urban areas. However, Bangkok’s constant change 
and growth remains a challenge, driving vulnerabilities to 
hazards, safety, health, poverty and people’s well being..

CITY DYNAMICS 
URBANIZATION
Over the last 250 years Bangkok has blossomed from a small 
fortress town to a 21st century megalopolis. Today, the built up 
area of Bangkok is almost 16 times greater than in 1958. The 
registered population in Bangkok increased from 1.6 million 
in 1958 to 5.4 million in 1986 and is projected to grow to 15.32 
million in 2020 [1].  A great number of unregistered people 
also live and commute into Bangkok, swelling its official 
numbers. These bustling and exciting mixes of international 
and Thai people compete for, and also provide, its unique 
services. Bangkok is world renowned for its incredible street 
food, shopping and architecture and as a base for important 
tourism and business sectors. 

The way traditional and modern practices come together is a 
critical part of its attractiveness to visitors and those who live 
here. It also reflects, and caters for a significant income divide, 
which is experienced in most large cities. The authorities, as 
well as Bangkok’s citizens, are working to build their economic 
opportunities, and it is critical that legislative, social and 
governance structures support fair livelihood opportunities 
for all Bangkokians individually to contribute to the country’s 
economy.

To be able to ensure sufficient public services such as 
drainage, suitable road layouts and electricity and create 
urban areas that promote safe and healthy buildings and 
lifestyles, growth must be well planned and regulated. This is a 
great challenge in a city experiencing rapid growth. 

Bangkok is situated on low-lying flat land, below sea-level in 
some areas. Originally this land was well suited to serving as 
rice paddy fields, and as the flood plain for the Chao Phraya 
River and its many tributaries that drain the massive monsoon 
rains into the Gulf of Thailand. This land has now largely been 
developed and houses many residents, business and transport 
corridors. There are a great many people and their livelihoods, 
as well as productive industries, including important foreign 
direct investment relying on this flood-prone land remaining 
safe, despite the difficult location. 

Effective control of land use in Bangkok influences a great 
number of other development areas including industrial and 
agricultural output, transportation, water and food security, 
environmental protection, climate change, drainage and solid 
waste management, subsidence control, migration and illegal 
immigration, disaster mitigation and social welfare.

BRIEF HISTORY   BANGKOK

WHY DO WE NEED 
TO WORRY? 

RESILIENCE CHALLENGES 
TRANSPORT AND AIR QUALITY
One of the most obvious urban problems for Bangkok is its 
traffic congestion. According to a study by TOMTOM  in 2016, 
Bangkok experiences the second worst traffic congestion in the 
world after Mexico City [2].  Insufficient public transportation 
facilities and increasing private car ownership have caused an 
acute problem across major thoroughfares in the city for over a 
decade. 

The road system has not been able to keep up with the city’s 
intensifying road use. The daytime commuting population is 
so high in number that congestion problems have remained 
despite the construction of several high-speed elevated 
expressways. The use of private vehicles by city dwellers and 
those commuting from surrounding areas has reached 53 per 
cent and is projected to rise to 59 per cent by 2037 [3].  In 
2014, there were 8,651,172 registered vehicles in Bangkok. Of 
these 317,870 were newly registered private cars, equivalent to 
870 new cars per day. In this year, 405,649 new motorcycles 
were registered, equivalent to 1,111 new motorcycles per day.

2020

WHY DO WE NEED TO WORRYRecent electric-powered underground and overhead (‘BTS 
Skytrain’) transport links have provided many commuters 
with traffic-free, but relatively expensive options; however old 
buses and an ever-growing number of cars, vans and trucks 
continue to be a critical way to transport goods and people 
around the city. Blocked roads and harmful carbon monoxide 
emissions cause difficulties as well as serious health issues. 
The city needs a complex and widespread system of rail, boat, 
skytrain and underground mass transit systems to answer all 
the requirements for a cheap, resilient and extensive public 
transport system which reaches to the suburbs where most 
residents need it

The government has prioritized public awareness initiatives 
and activities relating to traffic control and driving quality 
across Thailand. Bangkok has seen greater enforcement of 
traffic and safety violations and safety rules which contribute 
to risk as well as overall traffic congestion. But challenges 
remain for road-building, including a shortage of funds to 
extend the road network and difficulties in expropriating 
private land for road construction. 

The extensive use of motorcycles and tuk-tuks gives Bangkok 
a unique quality. These vehicles do contribute to road safety 
issues although the city has been successful in introducing 
regulations to increase the quality and safety of motorcycle 
taxis. The roads and sidewalks remain notoriously dangerous 
for cyclists and pedestrians, as well as unpleasant because of 
noxious fumes.

WHY DO WE NEED TO WORRYBANGKOK

Besides the immediate costs of congestion, including long 
commute times and blocking the access for first responder 
vehicles such as police and ambulances, vehicle emissions 
are the greatest source of air pollutants in Bangkok. This 
is becoming one of the city’s most pressing health risks. 
Air quality monitoring performed by the Pollution Control 
Department (PCD) indicates that in Bangkok 24-hour 
average values of particle pollution exceeded air quality 
standards. Areas found to exceed particulate pollution on a 
daily basis are: Din Daeng District, Rat Burana District,  Phra 
Khanong District, Chatuchak District, Ministry of Science and 
Technology, Ratchathewi District, Ratchathewi District Office 
and Pathum Wan District [4].

To compound this air pollution, Bangkok has one of the lowest 
percentages of green areas of any major capital in Asia. 
According to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Asian Green 
City Index 2011, commissioned by Siemens, on average, urban 
citizens in Asia enjoy 39 sq.m. of green space each, while 
Bangkok has a mere 3sq.m. each [5] Economist Intelligence 
Unit. (2011) Asian Green City index. Green areas act as a CO2 
sink and filter many pollutants from the air, thereby improving 
air quality and lowering the health risk. Resilient development 
that balances environmental conservation, and the health and 
well being of the population remains a challenge for Bangkok 
[6].

WHY DO WE NEED TO WORRYThe Chao Phraya and Mae Klong Rivers are the main source of 
potable water supply to the city. However, domestic, industrial 
and agricultural waste provide water purification challenges, 
and cause physical blockages. Water from ground sources is 
known to be limited and at risk, and its use by industry has 
caused concerning subsidence of the entire delta area. 

The city is located on layers of soft clay, which provide 
numerous problems for heavy infrastructure. The over-
pumping of ground water out of aquifers under this clay 
causes ground settlement which is experienced as land 
subsidence across the city. The subsidence reached its most 
critical state in the early 1980s when it occurred at a rate as 
high as 120 mm/year. Active management of ground water 
use has allowed the subsidence rate to decrease but the 
threat remains. Bangkok is also situated between 1 metre 
below and 2 metres above mean sea level. Those areas below 
sea level are particularly vulnerable to any changes in water 
level.  This threat will become more important as relative sea-
levels rise, both from subsidence and as a result of a changing 
climate. Relative sea-level rise  increases the risk of salt-water 
incursion into the Chao Phraya River as well as increasing 
flood risk in the delta as water drains slower in times of flood 
and high river water.

WASTE AND WATER
Although the municipal authority has been active in solid 
waste management since 1915, solid waste is a major concern 
for Bangkok. The daily municipal waste generated by city 
dwellers and from light industry is growing rapidly, from 7,000 
tonnes per day in 1993 to around 8,800 tonnes per day in 
2014, and expected to reach 11,500 tonnes per day by 2025.  

Bangkok faces challenges related to the separation of solid 
waste once collected. Much of this waste could be dealt 
with more sustainably. Around 14 per cent is recyclable, and 
up to 48 per cent is organic waste and could be mulched, 
incinerated or otherwise disposed of. In response to this 
challenge, the city is focusing on improving the efficiency of 
organic waste management and supporting solid waste reuse 
and recycling.

INEQUALITY LEAVING PEOPLE WITHOUT 
BASIC NEEDS
Massive migration to Bangkok by people seeking good 
livelihood options and security has resulted in areas of 
inevitable poverty or illegal status which are currently 
uncatered for. There remain areas of unplanned informal 
building where people live and work in places which are 
unsafe, unsanitary and lack basic service provision, putting 
people at risk. It is estimated by some social work NGOs that 
up to 20% of Bangkok’s residents live on squatter settlements 
[7]. The precarious social and legal positions of residents 
mean they do not receive the full set of public services which 
can reduce risk, such as waste collection, pest control and 
storm-drain clearance, which makes them more vulnerable to 
flood, health problems and other hazards [7]. 

One example of a squatter settlement is in Klong Toei, to the 
South East of Bangkok’s city center which has been home 
to a diverse community of an estimated 80,000 people, 
including migrants to Bangkok, for more than half a century. 
Residents of this community live in uncertain financial, legal, 
and social conditions and work together to try to survive in 
an environment which can put them at massive risk [8]. Flood 
risk from the adjoining Chao Phraya puts residents at risk of 
damage to their belongings, health, education, safety and 
source of income, causing greater poverty and dependence. 
Flood risk, and its impacts on health, livelihoods and safety, 
would be mitigated if the community was provided with 
certain public services, but their unregistered and illegal status 
makes it difficult for government agencies to justify this work.   

Undocumented workers are vulnerable to exploitation and 
often suffer poor working conditions and low wages. The 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Bangkok 
stated  after the 2011 floods that migrants are particularly 
at risk of being arrested, deported and fined after disasters. 
Any work permits and registration documents owned often 
get destroyed, and people are limited to the province where 
they were first registered despite losing livelihoods and 
outstanding pay.

WHY DO WE NEED TO WORRYKlong Toei - FIRE - On 2 March 1991, 
chemical containers in Bangkok 
Port (Klong Toei) exploded and 
caused a terrible fire. It took about 
three days to control this fire and 
residents of both the Klong Toei 
community and nearby areas were 
evacuated to temporary housing 
in Lumpini Park. A total of 5,417 
people were displaced as a result of 
the incident. 

25

WHY DO WE NEED TO WORRYBANGKOK

FLOOD RISK
Flood is a natural phenomenon in the Chao Phraya River 
Basin. Bangkok’s situation, on the lower basin, on flat land 
reaching towards a low-lying delta, means up to 4 km on 
either side of the river is the natural flood plain. Bangkok has 
always received floodwater during the 5-month long annual 
monsoon. In the past, fields, canals, irrigation channels and 
both natural and man-made flood retention areas (known in 
Thai as ‘Gamling’ or Monkey Cheeks as they hold water) acted 
to reduce flood impacts. The flood water was even utilized for 
farming rice tolerant to high water events. 

With the trend of urbanization, water bodies were slowly 
replaced by settlements and roads, and Bangkok started 
to experience floods as one of the first recognized urban 
hazards. Urban ground cover affects not only the direction 
of the water flow but flood depth, velocity and duration. 
The building of flood barriers in some places has protected 
those areas, sometimes putting other areas at greater risk, 
or allowing people to build behind barriers which cannot 
fully protect them from all floods, and can fail [9]. Now, 
complex urban systems, including electricity, transport, 
communications, drinking water supply, livelihoods and many 
other elements are more likely to be disturbed as they are 
concentrated in a locations exposed to flood. Wider systems, 
including the management of water flow elsewhere in the 
Chao Phraya River Basin, also impact on what is experienced 
in Bangkok. Rainfall throughout the region is subject to 
unpredictability as a result of climatic changes making it more 
difficult to regulate dams and river flows to meet the needs of 
farmers and industry upriver, and protect households in both 
rural and urban areas [10]. 

2626

WHY DO WE NEED TO WORRYIn 1917 and 1942, Bangkok experienced devastating floods. 
The city also experienced floods during 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980, 
1983 and 1995. 2011 saw Thailand experience a historically 
devastating flood with a significant impact to Bangkok and its 
surrounding areas. Among the complex causes of the flood 
were the natural effects of extreme monsoon rainfall and the 
low capacity of upstream rivers, but also changes to land 
use and water management including urbanization on the 
flood zones, diversion of water through certain channels, dam 
height and lack of proper maintenance of water structures [9].

CHALLENGES TO BUILDING 
RESILIENCE TO SHOCKS AND 
STRESSES
COMMUNITY RESILIENCE IN URBAN 
SETTINGS
Risks posed by shocks and stresses can be reduced by 
communities working together to prepare and protect 
each other from vulnerabilities and to recover quickly. It is 
recognized that building a strong, unified and fair community 
within a diverse and dynamic urban setting is a huge 
challenge. Bangkok is a huge, sprawling city, bolstered each 
day by millions of commuters and tourists. Different agendas, 
languages and levels of wealth, to name a few criteria, 
illustrate some of the barriers to encouraging people to work 
together for a stronger and safer Bangkok, and support each 
other. The responsibility of providing a safe and productive 
city for all inhabitants remains with the authorities, but 
community resilience-building could be a tool used by BMA, 
NGOs and others to help bring people together to be aware of 
and mitigate risks created in the city. 

Getting community participation for resilience could be based 
upon the unique way in which urban communities have been 
formed in the Bangkok vicinity. A number of communities 
have the potential to take community-driven initiatives for 
resilience that would complement risk-reduction initiatives 
by the authorities. Some communities exist within temples, 
mosques, churches, in common business activity areas, 
and around local markets who may be able to self-organize 
towards a common goal of resilience, while promoting 
generosity and equality. Newcomers sharing living space such 
as residents of condominiums and housing estates could also 
form communities to support resilience building [11]. 

ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
Bangkok is inextricably linked to the global economy. This 
brings trade, tourism, investment and great opportunities 
for diversity and growth. It also exposes the economy to 
world market fluctuations and competition. This was borne 
out in the East Asia financial crash of the late 1990s where 
weaknesses in Asian financial systems plunged Thailand and 
its neighbours’ economy into a deep recession. Being export-
dependent, Thailand’s economies is vulnerable to shocks and 
stresses, including those brought by climatic phenomena and 
political unrest. Drought affects agricultural production and 
trade frequently. 

2828

WHY DO WE NEED TO WORRYThe 2011 Thailand floods caused approximately 1.4 trillion 
THB (USD 47 billion) of economic damage. Many publicly 
owned companies faced a huge challenge to return to normal 
production levels and the country had to actively bolster 
foreign investor confidence in Thailand’s resilience [12]. In the 
aftermath of the 2011 floods, the Thai government initiated a 
National Disaster Fund of 50.0 billion THB (USD 1.4 billion) 
to support the provision of natural disaster risk coverage to 
households, small firms and industries. 

INEQUALITY
Over the last four decades, Thailand’s economy has grown 
remarkably, moving from a low-income country to an upper-
middle income country in less than a generation. As such, 
Thailand is a widely cited development story, with sustained 
strong growth and impressive poverty reduction, particularly 
in the 1980s. However, access to these economic opportunities 
is unequal, and many Bangkok residents still live in informal 
settlements, and in poverty.

Thailand’s recent period of political unrest also poses a risk 
to the city’s fragile economic recovery following the 2011 
flood event. The Asia Development Bank lowered predictions 
for Thailand’s growth from 3.6 percent to 3.2 per cent, 
citing contracted merchandise exports and deterioration of 
Thailand’s consumer confidence index.  Despite this, tourism 
numbers have been steadily rising since their slump in 2013 
and 2014, following a period of unrest.  Bangkok was recently 
recognized as the world’s most visited city, and the country 
relies heavily on tourism, which accounts for roughly 15 per 
cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Grass-roots businesses, known as micro, small and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs) such as small shops, street food sellers 
and self-employed domestic workers are at great risk from 
physical, social, legislative and economic shocks; and are less 
able to adapt themselves quickly to prepare or build back 
better after an event. Supporting MSME’s to build resilient 
businesses will help Bangkok’s economy to be stronger in the 
face of shocks and stresses.

It has been recognized that there is an unequal distribution of 
risk. Livelihoods and accommodation that are more exposed 
to the elements, poor quality buildings and air quality are 
often taken by poorer people, putting them at greater 
exposure to hazards without giving the capacity to manage 
the risks.

The income divide between average wages in Bangkok 
compared to Thailand’s other provinces, as well as between 
social strata within Bangkok, puts some at much greater 
risk than others. It is critical that authorities create an 
enabling environment for everyone who is impacted by 
the management of Bangkok to be able to participate in 
developing and challenging that policy to create a resilient, 
wonderful city that has opportunities and safeguards for all. 

There have been numerous coup d’état’s in Thailand in 
recent decades. Political instability at a national level has 
ramifications for the city. Riots and protests have physically 
taken place in Bangkok, adversely impacting tourism and 
disrupting services. Since May 2014, Thailand has been 
governed at a national level by a military government, called 
the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), which has 
brought some stability to the country, and the capital. The 
NCPO has since drafted a new constitution which paves the 
way for a general election to take place in 2017 and with it 
greater political stability for the country.

STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT 
PROCESS

The development of this strategy began with an Agenda 
Setting Workshop in September 2014. Following the 
workshop, research and consultation was undertaken to better 
understand the challenges facing the city. While Bangkok has 
become a world renowned mega-city visited by more people 
each year than any other in the world, it has suffered and 
will continue to experience a variety of shocks and stresses, 
putting its physical and social infrastructure under further 
strain. 
 
A series of large-scale workshops with the public and private 
sector, civil society, academia and Bangkok residents revealed 
a variety of perceptions of the city’s resilience challenges 
both during everyday conditions and under times of increased 
stress, such as directly following the 2011 floods. Over 500 
individuals participated in this consultation. 

Participants were asked to consider a variety of questions 
related to 12 drivers of resilience that comprise the City 
Resilience Framework (CRF). The CRF allowed participants 
to comprehensively identify what they considered to be the 
city’s strengths and weaknesses. This would be the foundation 
for developing actions to address these weaknesses, and to 
build on our strengths. A Preliminary Resilience Assessment 
was produced, which summarised findings from this process 
and proposed key areas for further investigation.

Five working teams comprized of staff from across a 
variety of departments within the Bangkok Metropolitan 
Administration and in collaboration with universities and other 
specialists in the city were assembled to explore each area 
and consider solutions to the core issues that were found. 
The solutions, outlined in this strategy, are comprized of 
new initiatives designed to respond specifically to the issues 
identified, and existing programs that have been enhanced or 
scaled-up to further increase their benefits across the city. A 
full list of participants and collaborators can be found at the 
end of this document. 

Some solutions will make an immediate difference to the lives 
of Bangkokians, while others will build longer term resilience 
through a gradual process of shifting behaviours and 
perspectives. More than disaster response or risk reduction, 
all initiatives in this strategy work together to provide the 
resilience dividend, that is, they work together to reduce the 
impact from a number of shocks and stresses while providing 
multiple benefits to city residents; rich, poor, young and old 
alike.

100 RESILIENT CITIES 

100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation 
(100RC) helps cities around the world become more resilient 
to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a 
growing part of the 21st century. Bangkok’s application was 
selected from almost 1100 that were submitted by cities from 
around the world.

As a part of the network, Bangkok receives funding for a Chief 
Resilience Officer to coordinate resilience efforts across the 
city, including the development of this strategy. It also has 
access to the experience and expertise of other cities in the 
network and the 100RC platform; a group of leading service 
providers who offer in-kind support to member cities. In this 
way, Bangkok joins a global community of urban resilience 
practitioners implementing integrated, city-wide resilience 
actions around the world. 

Bangkok has made a step forward in setting a long-term 
futuristic vision as a blueprint for the city to grow. The 
Bangkok Vision 2032 “Bangkok: Vibrant of Asia”, an outcome 
of initiatives jointly conducted by BMA and Chulalongkorn 
University, reflects people-centred perspectives on what 
Bangkok should look like and how to reach that desirable 
future. It highlights six strategic dimensions: Safe City, 
Green City, City for All, Compact City, Democratic City, and 
Economic and Capitalise Knowledge-based City. It also has 
performance measures to achieve concrete outcomes.
 
The three Strategic Action Areas outlined in this resilience 
strategy will compliment Bangkok’s vision for the future. It 
will work alongside the city’s investments to upgrade and 
transform city systems to ensure that Bangkok is a safe, 
liveable and sustainable city for all by increasing quality of life, 
reducing risk and increasing adaptation and driving a strong 
and competitive economy.    

DRIVING CHANGE IN BANGKOK

The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), organized 
in accordance with the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration 
Act 1985, is responsible for the management of the city of 
Bangkok. It is the sole organization at the local authority level 
responsible for the well being of Bangkok residents with some 
financial support from the central government.
 

This will not only allow the city to fulfil its functions as 
envisaged for the future, but also reduce the impacts of 
shocks and stresses, ensuring that all city residents will be 
able to share and enjoy the development gains accumulating 
over time without serious interruption. 

This task will not be easy. Implementation will be an ongoing 
challenge to ensure alignment and coordination between 
siloed city departments in a city that is rapidly changing. From 
an ever-growing population, to urban expansion and a thriving 
young manufacturing industry, Bangkok is hurtling forward 
and challenging its administrators to catch-up. In recognition 
of this, this strategy represents a serious commitment from 
BMA to resilience building efforts to ensure that the city 
not only grows but that it brings all residents along on that 
journey.

BANGKOK FOR TOMORROW

Each action area comprises a series of goals for the city. To 
achieve each of these goals, Bangkok will implement a broad 
program of activities with specific, implementable sub-
actions. Some will be implemented directly by BMA, others 
will be delivered in partnership with a range of private and 
public sector organizations. Most are new initiatives designed 
to fill recognized gaps in the city’s current capabilities, while 
some are existing projects that will be expanded or improved 
to fully realise their resilience benefits. Implementing projects, 
like the benefits they will generate, will unfold over the short, 
medium and long term. 

These actions are the first set of actions that look at city-wide 
initiatives in a different way, to consider how one action can 
address multiple problems and provide multiple benefits, as 
well as how stakeholders can better work together to achieve 
resilience outcomes for the city. They will not be the last. To 
become a truly resilient city will require many hands, much 
work and constant evolution.

This section outlines a program of interrelated actions that will 
work together to build resilience across Bangkok. It is made 
up of three Strategic Action Areas designed to bring Bangkok 
closer to its vision of a safe, liveable and sustainable city for 
all. These action areas are: 

INCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH:

GOAL 1: Health and wellbeing for all city residents, now and 
into the future
GOAL 2: Safe, accessible and convenient transportation 
network 
GOAL 3: Environmentally friendly urbanization

REDUCING RISK AND INCREASING  
ADAPTATION THROUGH:

GOAL 4: Improving resilience to floods 
GOAL 5: Increasing public and community-driven action on 
awareness, preparedness and adaptation
GOAL 6:  institutional capacity and regulation

DRIVING A STRONG AND COMPETITIVE

Increasing quality of life through improved social 
services is important for the resilience of Bangkok – 
particularly for our most vulnerable residents. Access 
to healthcare is well-regarded, with universal healthcare 
available to all Thai nationals and to a certain extent 
registered migrants.  However, significant challenges 
remain, including rising costs, inequalities, an ageing 
population and unhealthy habits among residents.

While a major challenge for Bangkok is ensuring 
healthcare and facilities meet the evolving needs of an 
ageing population, promoting a healthy lifestyle and 
habits that prevent illness and injury are important to 
quality of life across all age brackets. Improving these 
aspects of residents’ lives can also significantly reduce 
strain on the healthcare system and reduce economic 
costs associated with illness and ageing. 

Increasing mobility and connectivity through safe, 
accessible and convenient transportation networks, and 
promoting green spaces in urban areas, will make the 
city a more pleasant and accessible place to live and 
help to facilitate healthy behaviours and recreation. This 
key action area has three goals:

ACTION AREA 1GOAL 1: HEALTH AND 
WELLBEING FOR 
ALL CITY RESIDENTS, 
NOW AND INTO THE 
FUTURE 

To address health-related issues and the physical 
wellbeing of different population segments in the city, 
this goal will focus on improving systems to deliver 
comprehensive health care services. Specific groups 
who are vulnerable to health conditions, including 
the elderly, migrant workers, and those living in 
squalid environments will benefit from the following 
interventions: 
 
• 

Promoting healthy living and lifestyles 

• 

• 

Epidemic prevention in urban communities  

Preparing for quality ageing.

ACTION AREA 1BANGKOK

1.1 PROMOTING HEALTHY LIVING AND LIFESTYLES 

LIVING IN A BUSY CITY CAN RESULT IN LESS HEALTHY LIFESTYLES, WHICH CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF NON-
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, INCLUDING DIABETES. IN SUPPORT OF HEALTHIER LIFESTYLES, BMA WILL IMPLEMENT 
THE FOLLOWING PROJECT AS PART OF THIS RESILIENCE STRATEGY.

1.1.1 SCREENING FOR DIABETES AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IN PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 21

Eating habits are a leading risk factor for health problems for the residents of 
Bangkok. Junk food and lack of proper exercise leads to problems such as obesity, 
high blood pressure and diabetes. Younger generations in particular increasingly 
face health issues such as heart disease and depression.  This initiative will raise 
awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle and provide opportunities for 
healthcare providers to engage with residents about their daily habits, facilitating 
the early detection and prevention of non-communicable diseases. 
 
ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This project will work with healthcare providers to establish screening programs for 
high blood pressure in people aged over 21. This screening program will also raise 
awareness among the target group about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.  

TIMELINE:

Ongoing, starting in 2017

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Health Promotion Division, Health 
Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Early detection of diseases in new 
patients will ensure early treatment, 
reducing strain on the healthcare 
system, and reducing the severity of 
illnesses and mortality rates. It will 
also encourage early intervention in 
unhealthy lifestyles and help promote 
healthier habits among city residents. 
A healthier population will be better 
positioned to engage in city life and 
contribute to the community.

ACTION AREA 11.2 EPIDEMIC PREVENTION IN URBAN COMMUNITIES

FOR BANGKOK TO ACHIEVE HEALTH AND WELLBEING FOR ALL, VIGOROUS ACTIONS ON EPIDEMIC PREVENTION 
ARE CRITICAL, PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEALTH PROBLEMS AND INFECTIOUS 
DISEASES. CONSISTING OF THE TWO SUB-PROJECTS DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS INITIATIVE WILL FOCUS ON EPIDEMIC 
PREVENTION AND CONTROL IN THE MIGRANT WORKER HOUSING AT CONSTRUCTION SITES ACROSS BANGKOK. 
IT WILL ENHANCE DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND IMPROVE LIVING CONDITIONS FOR 
LABOURERS AND MIGRANT WORKERS. 

1.2.1 EVENT BASED SURVEILLANCE FOR PANDEMICS 

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Health Department of BMA, Institute 
of Urban Disease Control of Ministry 
of Public Health, and Private Health 
units

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

By developing an integrated, 
community-based network of disease 
surveillance and health standards for 
migrant worker housing, healthcare 
can be extended to the city’s large 
population of unregistered migrants 
and illegal workers. This will increase 
the quality of life of migrant workers 
in over 300 camps across Bangkok.
 
BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents of Bangkok, labourers and 
workers. 

Every year a significant number of workers, particularly migrant workers, suffer 
from communicable diseases due to complicated risk factors associated with 
working conditions, migrant worker housing environments, and health practices. 

As the city continues to grow, with a reliance on migrant workers and labor forces 
as the backbone of construction activities, it is essential that disease prevention 
and control systems are inclusive of health-related issues and epidemic control for 
this vulnerable group.  

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The project will focus on developing comprehensive systems for epidemic control 
and prevention among labour forces and migrant workers. This includes activities 
ranging from medical screening, integrated network surveillance, vaccination, and 
improving sanitation, to developing regulations that mandate disease surveillance 
in campsites and the use of media for health risk communication. 

BMA – together with Ministry of Public Health, public and private health care units 
including hospitals, clinics, and community health centers – will play crucial roles 
in implementing these activities with support from surveillance networks including 
occupational health and safety officers and volunteers.

of Health, Ministry of Public Health; 
Institute for Urban Disease Control, 
Ministry of Public Health; Public 
Health Law Centre.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

These measures will help to ensure 
minimum standards in workplaces 
and housing which caters to migrant 
workers. This will contribute to 
increasing the quality of life for 
these residents and improving health 
outcomes for migrant workers.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Migrant workers in Bangkok.

It is critical that health and safety regulations and standards are complied with at 
all employment places to ensure the well being of workers. It has been identified 
that some workplaces, in particular those which employ a high proportion of 
migrant workers and low-income workers (such as the industrial sector) do not 
comply, thereby putting this section of society at risk. Moreover, many of these 
workers live in substandard housing at different locations of the city. This initiative 
will study the current situation of high risk workplaces, and the living environments 
of their work, especially of concentrations of migrant workers to ensure a higher 
health and safety standard.   

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION  

This initiative will be implemented through an in-depth study of workplaces and 
housing known to have migrant laborers. 
Focus group discussion, interviews and workshops will be conducted to 
understand the key issues and improve the quality of working conditions and 
housing sites.

ACTION AREA 11.3 PREPARING FOR QUALITY AGEING

AS THE POPULATION OF BANGKOK REMAINS HEALTHIER INTO OLD AGE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY TO BE 
ABLE TO CATER FOR THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. CONSISTING OF THE THREE SUB-PROJECTS DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS 
INITIATIVE WILL ADDRESS THE IMPLICATIONS OF AGEING FROM VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES – SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, 
ENVIRONMENTAL, MENTAL, AND BEHAVIOURAL. IT WILL ALSO HELP DEVELOP POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS 
AGEING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY, AND PROMOTE INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE ELDERLY.

1.3.1 SUPPORT FOR ELDERLY RESIDENTS   

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Graduate School of Environmental 
Development Administration, 
National Institute of Development 
Administration and BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Savings schemes and a cooperative 
approach will increase independence 
and ensure quality of life for elderly 
residents. 
 
BENEFICIARIES: 

Elderly residents.

The average life expectancy in Thailand has increased notably over the last 
decade, resulting in an increase in the number of elderly people. Accompanying 
this are changes in family structure with a trend towards smaller families, leaving 
an increasing number of elderly people vulnerable to improper attention and care. 
The situation is more acute in Bangkok, where the family unit is not as strong 
compared to smaller cities and rural areas in Thailand. This particular initiative aims 
to understand and put in place a well-designed savings scheme aimed at enabling 
older savers to become financially independent. 

Risks to the elderly will be researched, including the drivers of stress, crime and 
safety. Support schemes will be investigated and implemented to build social 
support and social services for people growing older to remain independent, safe 
and well. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This initiative aims to design and implement a savings scheme to support elderly 
residents to be financially secure and independent. This will require a thorough 
understanding of the current financial needs of the elderly and how these may be 
better supported. 
Risks to the elderly will be researched, including the drivers of stress, crime and 
safety. The savings scheme will be accompanied by appropriate social services 
and programs for the elderly to more fully support this growing group in our 
community to remain independent, safe and well.

1.3.2 PREPARING THE POPULATION AGED 18 – 59 FOR OLD AGE  

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Health Promotion Division, Health 
Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

By supporting residents to prepare 
for old age earlier in life, the city 
is taking a proactive approach 
to facilitating quality ageing in 
all residents. This include more 
opportunities for elderly residents to 
participate in city life, to interact and 
form networks with each other and to 
develop healthy habits and financial 
security into old age. 
 
BENEFICIARIES: 

Citizens of Bangkok aged 18-59.

A key element of community resilience is social cohesion which is a recognized 
challenge in urban places. In particular, older people can be supported well by 
families, neighbours and others by working together to look after their social and 
physical needs. The social structure of Bangkok is becoming more modernized and 
isolated and less family-oriented. It is important to raise the awareness of 18-59 
year old Bangkokians about social responsibility to encourage them to help each 
other to meet the current and future needs of older people in the city.
 
ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This initiative has two objectives: to build awareness in the population of what they 
will require as they age and what they can do now to prepare for old age (savings, 
social networks, etc.), and; to build stronger social networks by connecting 
the younger population to older residents through various activities including 
education, religion, culture and sport.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Current gaps in transportation 
system facilities for elderly people
will be better understood allowing 
for interventions that will empower 
elderly residents to move about the 
city and reduce isolation.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Senior Citizens of Bangkok. 

By 2021, around 20 per cent of the population of Bangkok will be considered 
elderly. The current transportation system does not cater the needs of elderly 
people, limiting their ability to travel on their own and increasing isolation. This 
initiative will focus on understanding the current system’s shortcomings and future 
needs for accessible and safe transport options. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION  

This study will undertake primary research to better understand the existing 
shortcomings of Bangkok’s transportation system. It will include physical 
investigations of existing infrastructure, as well as interviews with older residents to 
understand their needs and the ways in which existing systems are failing to meet 
these needs. Attention will be given to identifying required facilities for elderly 
people.

GOAL 2: SAFE, 
ACCESSIBLE AND 
CONVENIENT 
TRANSPORTATION 
NETWORK 

The mobility of Bangkok residents is currently limited 
by significant traffic and inadequate and over-capacity 
public transport systems. These are complicated and 
interrelated issues – new thinking will be needed if we 
are to provide safe, accessible and convenient solutions 
that meet the diverse needs of different segments 
of the population. This means being resourceful and 
building redundancy into transport systems, trialling 
multiple options to reduce traffic congestion and 
providing alternative networks and connection points. 
Interventions include:
•  An integrated mass transport system 

• 

• 

Improving traffic flow in the city

Reducing road related deaths through influencing 
driver behaviour and new technologies. 

COLLABORATING WITH MEXICO CITY
More than 50 per cent of cities in the 100RC network 
have identified transportation and sustainability as 
key issues in their resilience strategies. Bangkok and 
Mexico City share a number of common challenges. 
In both highly populated, urbanised mega cities, 
getting around is not easy – globally, Bangkok and 
Mexico City have been found to have the worst traffic 
congestion.

In response to this, like Bangkok, Mexico is focused 
on improving mobility through an integrated, safe 
and sustainable system that will transform the city’s 
current transportation system and how residents 
interact with it. Similarly, Bangkok is embarking on a 
master plan for an integrated mass transport system. 
As these initiatives unfold, Bangkok and Mexico will 
work closely together through the 100RC network 
to share progress, lessons, knowledge and insights 
throughout implementation.

ACTION AREA 12.1 INTEGRATED MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEM 

MASS TRANSIT SYSTEMS ARE WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO TRAFFIC 
CONGESTION IN MEGA-CITIES. TO MAKE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM IN BANGKOK MORE EFFECTIVE, LINKING 
ITS MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM TO THE CITY’S OTHER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS WILL MAXIMISE ITS USE 
AS A FAST, SAFE AND CONVENIENT WAY TO TRAVEL CURRENTLY, BANGKOK HAS A SKYTRAIN, AIRPORT LINK AND 
MASS RAPID TRANSPORT. UNDER THE CURRENT PLAN, DUE TO BE DELIVERED BY 2029, THIS WILL BE EXPANDED 
TO 548 KM. BETTER CONNECTING THESE SYSTEMS IS THE CORE OF THIS GOAL. BMA WILL IMPLEMENT THREE KEY 
INITIATIVES FOR THE INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, TO INCREASE 
CONNECTIVITY AND EXPAND THE LINKAGES BETWEEN DIFFERENT TRANSPORTATION MODES ACROSS BANGKOK, 
AS DESCRIBED BELOW. 

2.1.1 INTEGRATED MASS TRANSPORT SYSTEM MASTER PLAN 

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Traffic and Transportation 
Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Mobility is integral to the quality of 
life of Bangkok residents. Investing in 
a robust, integrated transport system 
will facilitate safer, more equitable 
and efficient movement of people 
in the city and reduce the use of 
private vehicles and their associated 
environmental impacts, while 
stimulating economic growth.  
 
BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents of Bangkok and visitors.

Thailand began developing its mass transit system in 1994 to cover a total distance 
of 373 kilometers. This comprises a connected system of underground railway lines 
(subway), BTS (sky train lines), and an Airport Rail Link. To increase mobility in 
Bangkok and populated suburban areas, secondary public transportation systems 
such as a monorail and light rail have been planned, aiming to expand coverage of 
the mass transit system and provide convenient access to different points across 
Bangkok.   

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION  

The project will develop a master plan for an integrated transport system, 
including the Mass Transit Master Plan, feeder system and other modes of public 
transportation such as bus and water transport to ensure connectivity across the 
city.

To maximize the use of an integrated and robust public transportation system in 
Bangkok, the Master Plan and budget for system operation will be prepared based 
on detailed studies, review and analysis of relevant research on secondary public 
transportation systems, physical volumes of traffic data and mobility information, 
forecasting public transit use and passengers, and assessing the efficiency of 
secondary public transportation in reducing road congestion.

2.1.2 EXPANSION OF MONORAIL FEEDER AND LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM 

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Traffic and Transportation 
Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Multiple and well-connected mass 
transportation facilities and networks 
will be made available for Bangkok 
residents for safe, fast and convenient 
daily commuting. This will offer an 
alternative mode of transportation in 
Bangkok, and reduce private vehicle 
use, contributing to a sustainable 
solution to traffic congestion and 
vehicle fuel consumption in Bangkok. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents of Bangkok.

Monorail feeders and light rail systems are to form an integral part of Bangkok’s 
mass transit system. Both systems are expected to increase the redundancy of the 
transport system – providing more residents with multiple mobility options – and 
provide greater connectivity and access to multiple linkage points, complementing 
the main Mass Transit Systems. Construction of monorail feeders and a light rail 
system will start on the completion of a comprehensive program and budget for 
system operation.  

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION  

This project will construct a monorail feeder and light rail system as a part of 
Bangkok’s interconnected mass transit system. This includes construction of the 
following: 
•  Monorail - Gray Line: Phase 1) Watcharaphon to Thonglor, 16.25 km, 15 stations. 

Phase 2) Phra Khanong to Rama 3, 12.17 km, 14 stations. Phase 3) Rama 3 to 
Tha Phra, 11.14 km, 9 stations.

•  Monorail – BMA 2 (Din Daeng Area) to Yothee, 6 km, 6 sky- stations and 1 

subway station interconnector

• 

• 

Rail Transit System, 4 km, along the road from Bang Wa to Taling Chan.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Traffic  and Transportation 
Department, BMA

Bangkok currently has water based transport to various city locations. However, 
the water transport network is not well linked with land transport networks. 
Integration of water based transport with the road and rail network will encourage 
city dwellers to use waterways more frequently.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This will be a faster and cheaper 
option for daily commuters along the 
Phasi Charoen Canal route.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents of Bangkok.

This project will pilot two new ferry services over the course of a year. The new 
service will include a 11.5 km route in Phasi Charoen Canal, between Phasi Charoen, 
Watergate Pier and Phetkasem 69. Phetkasem 69 pier will connect to the Bangkok 
Mass Transit System (BTS). A route will also go from klong Padung Krung Kasem to 
Hua Lum Pong (Central Station). This initiative will test the benefits of encouraging 
more people to use waterways, which are currently underutilized, cheaper, and less 
time consuming than some other modes of transport. Ferries will operate on these 
routes daily from 06:00 to 09:00am and 04:00 to 07.30pm.

Use of the service will be monitored carefully, including numbers of passengers and 
levels of satisfaction with the service. Near the end of the trial period the success 
of this new service will be evaluated and recommendations made on its future, 
including approaches for increasing the potential for more Bangkok residents to 
benefit from increased use of water-based transport

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Traffic and Transportation 
Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Multiple and well-connected mass 
transportation networks will improve 
residents’ mobility by providing safe, 
fast and convenient daily commuting. 
Shorter commute times will increase 
productivity and economic efficiency 
and contribute to broader economic 
growth. Reducing traffic congestion 
in school areas will also increase the 
health and wellbeing of children by 
reducing exposure to emissions, and 
reducing risk of traffic accidents. 

Samsen Road is a secondary road that links the important areas of Phra Nakhon, 
Dusit, and Bang Sue Districts. It also accepts traffic from the main road that 
connects travel between the east and west sides of Bangkok, and therefore 
is a critical thoroughfare for many residents and businesses. Currently, traffic 
conditions are particularly bad, with an average of up to 18,000 vehicles per hour 
during peak hours. This is exacerbated by the parking of private cars waiting to 
pick up students from schools . This causes congestion of nearby roads on which 
schools are located, massive traffic delays and concentrates pollution in these 
school areas. This initiative will study the impacts of traffic congestion in and 
around Samsen Road and determine approaches to reduce traffic congestion, 
including through improving the public transportation system especially for 
students.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:

This initiative will be implemented based on a detailed study of traffic volumes 
during peak and off peak hours, land use compatibility and road capacity. A 
development plan will be prepared for reducing traffic congestion and improving 
road safety.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Improving traffic flow in the city 
through a diverse range of policies 
and technologies will increase 
economic productivity and better 
ensure the safety and ease of 
movement of residents. Reduction in 
transit times will encourage a more 
active lifestyle, providing residents 
with greater opportunities for 
recreation.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents who commute through 
“Super Block Areas” and communities 
in these areas. 

A number of enclosed areas or a so-called ‘Super Block Areas’ in central Bangkok 
face severe traffic congestion.  The Super Blocks are enclosed space associated 
with commercial areas, business centres, residential areas or education institutes, 
which connect to few or far-away main roads and have insufficient ‘distributing 
roads’ inside to allow traffic flow.  Some of the available distributing roads are 
narrow lanes, discontinuous, with no linkages to other routes. Due to the number 
of occupants of super blocks, traffic problems in these area are of serious concern, 
and cause cascading traffic jams in adjacent main roads. This initiative aims to 
solve traffic problems in Super Block Areas through better understanding the 
integrated road network, and improving traffic regulations. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This initiative will explore feasible options to improve road networks in Super Block 
Areas in Bangkok. Studies will be conducted on different aspects regarding Super 
Block Areas and traffic congestion, causes and solutions, possible expansions and 
improving existing road conditions, traffic regulations and other safety measures 
to enhance road connectivity, mobility and safety. Land use options such as 
land development to downsize Super Block areas and strategic decisions on 
traffic movements in the selected areas, such as linkages to main roads, creating 
emergency routes for prompt access and road lighting will also be considered. The 
result will be used for formulation of Transportation Master Plan in Super Block 
Areas.

to reduce the use of private cars and 
increase the proportion of passengers 
using public transport. Reduction 
in the use of private vehicles will 
have a number of benefits including 
improving air quality in the city, 
reducing carbon emissions and a 
healthier lifestyle for Bangkokians. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

Bangkok residents and businesses.

Around the world, various Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies 
have proven to be effective in reducing demand for road travel, particularly in 
single-occupant vehicles. Some of these measures entail taxes for private car 
users to fund public costs such as traffic management, investment in road or 
public transporation system construction, and traffic pollution control. Some 
involve financial deterrents to limit or restrict the use of private cars in certain 
areas or routes, reducing traffic congestion in particular places at peak times. BMA 
will explore various TDM options for better mobility management, encouraging 
communities to use public transport rather than private vehicles. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

A feasibility study will be conducted on TDM focusing on Driving Credit Measures 
to limit the use of personal vehicles and Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) – a tax-
based measure which would impose an additional financial burden on owners of 
personal cars registered in Bangkok.

The study will also review road rules, laws, guidelines and case studies on the 
application of the TDM measures in other major cities. It will also develop a better 
understanding of the Bangkok-specific context in relation to TDM, including 
behaviours of private car users, mode of mobility, traffic volumes, mobility time 
and cost, and car user opinions. The outcomes of the study will support decisions 
on whether these TDM measures are appropriate, practical and viable for Bangkok.

2.3 REDUCING ROAD RELATED DEATHS THROUGH 
INFLUENCING DRIVER BEHAVIOUR AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES 

AS ROAD TRANSPORT REMAINS THE DOMINANT MODE OF TRANSIT FOR RESIDENTS, INCREASING ROAD SAFETY 
THROUGH INFLUENCING DRIVER BEHAVIOUR AND COMMUNICATION IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF FOCUS. THIS 
INITIATIVE HAS THREE SUB-PROJECTS APPROACHING THIS ISSUE FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF DRIVER BEHAVIOUR 
CHANGE, TESTING DRIVERLESS VEHICLES, AND ROAD SAFETY AUDITING.

2.3.1 ROAD SAFETY AUDIT

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Public Works Department and Local 
District Offices, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Improving the physical condition of 
roads will reduce the risk of accidents 
and contribute to a safer driving 
environment. Fewer accidents will 
help alleviate traffic congestion. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

BMA staff, and road users in Bangkok.

BMA is responsible for constructing and monitoring public infrastructure such as 
roads and bridges in Bangkok. It is important to maintain road safety standards 
during infrastructure development and monitoring. This initiative intends to 
disseminate information about safety standards relating to the physical condition 
of roads. This will be supplemented through the training of staff in auditing 
procedures. This will minimize road accidents inside the city and in adjoining areas 
that arise from poor road conditions. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION:  

This initiative will be implemented through a training workshop with staff at the 
Public Works Department of BMA. On the job training and case studies will be 
provided to educate staff on risks arising from the physical condition of roads and 
how these risks may be mitigated.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Traffic and Transportation 
Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Road users will be educated on traffic 
regulations and safe driving to reduce 
number of accident and casualties. 
Creating more awareness of road 
safety will encourage residents 
to take greater responsibility for 
their own safety and that of their 
community. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents of Bangkok. 

The use of private vehicles in the city is increasing, with more than half of the city’s 
residents using a personal vehicle as their primary or sole mode of transport. At 
the same time, Thailand is ranked second in the world with regard to the number 
of traffic fatalities, with 44 deaths per 100,000 people (5.1 per cent of Thailand’s 
overall deaths) [13].  This project aims to raise awareness, particularly among 
youth, about traffic regulations and road safety, to reduce road accidents. One 
component of enforcing driving safety standards is to ensure drivers in the highest 
risk category, youth, are aware of applicable regulations and road safety measures. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This initiative will be implemented in support of the National Government’s 
Policy (2011-2020) “Decade of Road Safety”. BMA will first investigate global 
best practices in addressing road deaths, and use this to develop messaging and 
delivery modes which will be most likely to change behaviour. Campaigns for 
building awareness and vigilance on road safety will be developed and rolled out 
across the city. These will use both electronic and print media.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Benefits range from environmental 
outcomes such as better air quality 
and reduced carbon emissions, to 
safer roads, less traffic congestion 
and improved mobility for vulnerable 
groups such as the disabled or 
elderly.

Driverless vehicles have significant potential to reduce traffic congestion and 
accidents in the city. Additionally, a driverless car can act as private and public 
transport, in that it can make multiple, consecutive trips, potentially reducing the 
number of cars on the road and reducing requirements for parking in urban areas. 
As a major car manufacturing hub, Bangkok is in a unique position to participate 
in the development and testing of these vehicles, giving our city an opportunity to 
benefit economically, as well as in terms of improved liveability.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The initiative will be implemented through a Public Private Partnership (PPP), 
involving private automobile companies, research institutes from home and abroad 
and BMA. The PPP approach will be designed with strong technology transfer and 
capacity building provisions.

ACTION AREA 1GOAL 3: 
ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY 
URBANIZATION 

Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important 
priority for Bangkok. As a major hub of industry, 
population and economic growth, Bangkok seeks to 
be a world leader among other Asian cities that have 
experienced rapid and unplanned growth, bringing with 
it the associated transport, waste management and land 
use challenges that impact on the health and wellbeing 
of its citizens. BMA’s program to lower the city’s carbon 
footprint and lessen the effects of carbon emissions 
consists of the following four initiatives: 
•  Green growth: supporting environmentally friendly 

growth and sustainable waste management

• 

Encouraging low-carbon transport 

•  Growing green space 

• 

Improving air quality management and 
communication.

LEARNING FROM MELBOURNE
In increasingly urbanised cities, land is scarce and 
often comes at a high premium. Lack of available land 
is one of Bangkok’s biggest challenges to growing the 
city’s green space. Melbourne is focused on greening 
of the city through one of its Strategy’s three flagship 
actions – implementing a Metropolitan Urban Forest 
Strategy. This action unites existing greening efforts by 
numerous stakeholders, helping them to understand 
how they can deliver urban greening projects that best 
contribute to improving ecosystem health and the 
services they naturally provide, such as air purification 
and temperature regulation. By sharing and exchanging 
knowledge through the 100RC network, Bangkok 
can learn from this approach to unite future greening 
activities to maximise a network of greening across the 
city.

3.1 GREEN GROWTH: SUPPORTING ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE WASTE 
MANAGEMENT 

THESE TWO PROJECTS WILL SUPPORT BETTER RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL OF RUBBISH AND WASTEWATER. BY 
PROMOTING COMMUNITY RECYCLING AND WASTE COLLECTION, AND THROUGH TURNING SOLID WASTE INTO 
USABLE ENERGY, LESS FOSSIL FUEL WILL BE CONSUMED AND THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF WASTE WILL BE 
REDUCED.

3.1.1 SUSTAINABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT 

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Environment Department, and 
Drainage and Sewerage Department, 
BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

The project will reduce solid waste 
disposal and treatment costs, reduce 
Gree House Gas emissions, devise 
suitable means and approaches for 
charging for waste and wastewater 
treatment, and improve quality of life 
for Bangkok residents.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Bangkok residents at the community 
level, through income generation 
from waste recycling and at the city 
level through sustainable growth and 
effective waste management.

Bangkok produces 22 per cent of the whole nation’s wastewater and yet can treat 
only 46 per cent of its wastewater daily. While part of the solution to this will be 
increasing capacity to process and treat Bangkok’s waste, the greatest and most 
cost-efficient gains can be made through reducing waste generation. This project 
has been developed to support sustainable waste and wastewater management 
to correlate with green growth development and the 20 year direction of the city 
development plan.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The project will encourage waste reduction in communities and businesses 
according to the reduce, reuse and recycle hierarchy, and study suitable means 
of charging for waste management and wastewater treatment. It will also run an 
awards program to reward communities and businesses for strong performance in 
waste and wastewater management.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Waste-to-energy plants can reduce 
waste volume to be disposed to 
landfill, while also reducing demands 
on fossil fuels, as well as Green House 
Gas emissions to the environment 
associated with landfills. These plants 
will also provide another source of 
employment for people of varying 
skill levels.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Producing 9,900 tons of solid waste per day, or 22 per cent of total waste in the 
country, Bangkok is struggling to find suitable landfill areas for waste treatment. 
Waste-to-Energy technologies can generate electricity by either incineration which 
is direct combustion or without direction combustion through thermal technology 
or non-thermal technology. This contributes to reducing waste volumes to landfill 
and provides a fossil fuel free source of electricity.  

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The project will construct a waste-to-energy plant which can treat 600 tons of 
solid waste per day of waste, and community plants with a total capacity of 600 
tons per day. 

The development ot this project will include an engagement process that includes 
meaningful community input into selecting sites for the plant that maximises the 
potential for environmental, social and economic benefits.

3.2 ENCOURAGING LOW CARBON TRANSPORT 

ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, LOW CARBON TRANSPORT OPTIONS IN BANGKOK WILL BE INCREASED BY THESE TWO 
PROJECTS. BY PROMOTING EXISTING EMISSION-FREE TRANSPORT AND LOOKING INTO BUILDING NEW BICYCLE 
PATHWAYS ACROSS THE CITY, CAR USE WOULD BE REDUCED AND COMMUTERS WILL ENJOY SAFER JOURNEYS 
WITH LESS TRAFFIC.

3.2.1 ENCOURAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TRANSPORTATION  

Air pollution in Bangkok has been increasing – today it exceeds air quality 
standards on most days, primarily due to the large quantity of vehicles using fossil 
fuels. This project aims to promote alternative ways of travel to reduce air pollution 
and traffic congestion in Bangkok.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

BMA will work with contracted consulting firms to improve the public’s awareness 
of the use of public transport and other means of environmentally friendly travel 
modes such as electric vehicles, bicycles and walking. Monitoring and evaluation, 
particularly of air quality will be done periodically to assess the impacts of the 
project.

partners

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

This project will result in enhanced 
accessibility to facilities and 
infrastructure for many vulnerable 
residents, promotion of local tourism, 
and pollution reduction along cycle 
paths. It will also enhance the city’s 
cultural landscape.
Effective cycling infrastructure will 
also provide alternative mobility 
options when disruption strikes road 
and/or public transport networks.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Bangkok residents and tourists, 
especially vulnerable residents who 
cannot afford a private vehicle.

Encouraging residents to take up cycling can have multiple benefits for the city. 
Cycling is a healthy, low impact form of exercise that can be enjoyed by all ages. 
In addition to health benefits, it can contribute to improved mobility for Bangkok 
residents, facilitating quicker, short commutes, connecting transportation options. 
Increased uptake of cycling can also reduce traffic congestion and improve air 
quality through reducing emissions from vehicles. Whilst Bangkok currently has 
some cycling pathways, these are desperate and not well connected. In some 
places they may also be unsafe, reducing their widespread appeal and use.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The study will analyse and make recommendations in relation to three areas: 
• 

Location of cycling pathways and physical facilities suitable for elderly 
persons, tourists, and communities in Bangkok.  

• 

Providing an enabling environment for cycling focusing on air quality, 
connection of cycling paths, public transport and potential communities/
tourism sites, layout and maps of accommodating facilities and landmarks.

• 

Enhancing local business facilities and capacities along cycling pathways.

and Pollution Control Department, 
Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Environment

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is the international standard to assess air quality on a 
daily basis. In Thailand, the AQI parameters and standards have been identified by 
the Pollution Control Department and have been applied throughout the country. 
However due to unique characteristics of air quality in a mega-city like Bangkok, 
which is different from other parts of the country, AQI parameters and standards 
for Bangkok should be developed specifically for the city to ensure more effective 
air quality management. 

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

A Bangkok air pollution inventory 
and database will assist in solving 
air pollution problems. This can be 
expected to result in a decline in 
respiratory diseases and increased 
health and quality of life for Bangkok 
residents.  

BENEFICIARIES: 

The residents of Bangkok who live, 
work or study in the city.

The project will develop an air emission inventory for Bangkok. The inventory 
will be used to determine and predict air pollution sources in Bangkok, as well as 
developing an accurate and reliable database (GIS-based) to support effective 
solutions to air pollution problems. The results from the Bangkok index will be used 
to raise awareness, and contribute to solving air pollution, health and sanitation 
problems in the city.

BANGKOK’S RAPID GROWTH FROM RURAL LAND TO A BUSTLING MEGA-CITY HAS MEANT REDUCING GREEN 
SPACES AND TREES, TO THE DETRIMENT OF ITS CITIZENS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE THREE PROJECTS AIM TO 
PROMOTE THE GROWTH OF PARKS, RECREATION GROUNDS AND OTHER URBAN GREEN AREAS, IN PRIVATELY AND 
PUBLICLY OWNED SPACES.

3.3.1 DEVELOPING NEW RECREATIONAL PARKS 

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Office of Public Park, Environment 
Department, BMA

Green space has a tremendous number of positive effects for a city. These range 
from ecosystem services like natural temperature regulation and reduction of 
surface water runoff, to psychological benefits and providing spaces for Bangkok 
residents to be active or relax.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

The initiative provides green 
recreation areas for Bangkok 
residents for improved quality of life 
and better environmental outcomes. 
The database will be used by decision 
makers to plan for more green spaces 
in the future.  

BENEFICIARIES: 

Bangkok residents.

BMA’s commitment to increase green space by 500,000 acres over the next 5 
years is one of its most important policies. This project aims to construct parks 
fully equipped with standard facilities and develop a database of green areas in 
Bangkok for future planning.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The project will see the construction of four new recreational parks to increase 
urban green space in Bangkok including:                                
•  Golden Jubilee Park to celebrate the 7th Auspicious Ceremony in Bang Bon 

(250 hectares)

•  Community park on the land at Phetkasem Soi 69, Bang Kae (70 acres)

•  Community park under the responsibility of Land Development Department 

(37 acres)

•  Community park at Soi Phrachaluamjai 7, Bueng Lum Pai, Minburi (78 acres).

Planning and development of these parks will embody the quality of inclusiveness 
by providing Bangkok residents with an opportunity to share their hopes and 
expectations for these new public spaces. The spaces will also be designed to 
maximise co-benefits, such as floodwater retention during extreme rainfall events, 
and to act as a safe gathering place in the event of a major shock such as a seismic 
disturbance.

The project will also survey and generate a database of green spaces in Bangkok

policy.

Planting trees is a simple and sustainable solution to reduce carbon emissions, 
adapt Bangkok to the effects of climate change, and reduce air pollution and 
its health effects on residents. Public engagement to increase green spaces on 
privately owned land is a low cost and sustainable way of improving the city’s 
environment. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This project includes awareness-raising and training for government officials, 
community leaders and members of the community to promote the importance 
of green spaces, and will select a pilot community to develop a community-based 
green area. The project also includes research on practical measures to support 
sustainable green space development, considering examples from across Thailand 
and globally, drawing on knowledge within the 100RC network.

The Chao Phraya River runs through the centre of Bangkok for over 70 kilometres. 
Public access to the riverbank is limited to transportation, public buildings, hotels 
and a limited number of parks. This project aims to restore Bangkok’s riverside area 
for public use and is strongly backed by residents and land owners.  

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The promenade will restore the 
public’s access to the river bank while 
also providing open green space and 
transport connectivity between major 
business districts. The promenade 
will be wheelchair accessible and 
provide recreational opportunities for 
the young, elderly and disabled. The 
promenade will also provide a new 
attraction for the city which will help 
boost trade and incomes for local 
residents.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Bangkok residents and visitors.

A five metre wide promenade will be developed along 1.2 km of the Chao Phraya 
River bank and will feature a walkway, cycling path and open green space for 
public recreational use. The cycling path will stretch from Rama 7 Bridge to Phra 
Pen Klao Bridge, on both sides of the river. The promenade will be strategically 
situated to connect central business districts and serve as a major hub for land 
and water transport. While some of the area to be converted is government 
owned, some will be acquired from local land owners. These land owners will be 
compensated for the contribution of their land.

WORKING TOGETHER WITH 
ROTTERDAM, MEXICO CITY AND NEW 
ORLEANS
Water is a significant issue in Bangkok, as it is for a 
number of its peers in the 100RC network. In October 
2015, the Chief Resilience Officers (CROs) of Bangkok, 
Berkeley, Mexico City, New Orleans, Norfolk, Rome, 
Rotterdam, Surat and Vejle convened in Rotterdam to 
share innovative approaches to water management 
and identify opportunities for collaboration. 
In developing this strategy, Bangkok continued this 
collaboration with the CROs of Rotterdam, New 
Orleans and Mexico City to shape a progressive, 
holistic approach to achieving its goal to improve the 
city’s flood resilience. This approach supplements the 
city’s need to maintain essential ‘grey’ infrastructure 
with new, ‘green’ and ‘blue’ infrastructure such as 
more parks and water retention and detention areas. 
This ‘green’ and ‘blue’ infrastructure provides multiple 
benefits for the city, including amenity, recreational 
space and cooling while also contributing strongly 
to reducing risks from flooding. It is the first step on 
a journey that will see Bangkok move closer towards 
living with water in new and innovative ways, rather 
than simply draining it. Over the next few years, 
Bangkok will also work to develop its vision for 
managing water in the city now and into the future.  

6666

ACTION AREA 2GOAL 4: IMPROVING 
RESILIENCE TO 
FLOODS

As a flood-prone city facing a changing climate, we 
must look at different approaches for ‘living with water’. 
These approaches represent a more integrated and 
holistic way to manage different city water systems, 
rather than solely depending on flood protection via 
hard infrastructure.

Initiatives to deliver this goal will focus on conservation 
and development of the city’s blue and green 
infrastructure, primarily by improved catchment 
management, open space, and green areas to maximize 
natural infrastructure for water management. These 
actions will be underpinned by community participation 
for integrated socio-economic, environmental and flood 
protection benefits. This will be combined with specific 
flood defence actions such as upgrading drainage and 
trialling the use of a flood resilience index in an urban 
area.
This goal is supported by the following three initiatives: 
•  Catchment management strategy and vision for the 

Chao Phraya Basin

•  Community water resource management programs

•  Urban flood defences.

This study will help to understand 
the current gaps and effective water 
management initiatives required in 
the future. This initiative will bring 
together diverse stakeholders to 
take a holistic approach to water 
management in the city, moving 
Bangkok beyond flood protection to 
look at how it will live with water now 
and into the future. 

BENEFICIARIES: 
This study will help to understand 
the current gaps and effective water 
management initiatives required in 
the future. This initiative will bring 
together diverse stakeholders to 
take a holistic approach to water 
management in the city, moving 
Bangkok and the upstream cities 
beyond flood protection to look at 
how these will live with water now 
and into the future.

For comprehensive flood management, it is necessary to understand the prevailing 
conditions in the lower Chao Phraya Basin. The Basin receives a large amount of 
water from the northern part of the country, which must pass through Bangkok 
before draining into the Gulf of Thailand. 

This action will help to establish a clear understanding of this process and explore 
how to utilize water passing through the Basin, both during the rainy season and 
the dry period. The areas to be covered under this initiative include the adjoining 
areas of Tah Cheen, Bang Phra Kong and Chao Phraya River.

Following this study, the city will determine objectives for water management in 
the near future. This will be set out as a clear vision, for agreement by stakeholders 
across the city. This vision will not only consider flood protection, but will embody 
a holistic approach to water in the city.  

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The activity will involve intensive situational analysis based on infrastructure, 
land use and land elevation and the climatic and socio-economic conditions of 
the selected areas. It will bring together stakeholders to set objectives for water 
management in the city and clearly set out these objectives for broad agreement 
across agencies responsible for water management, including those for flood 
protection and drainage, in Bangkok.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Will help to reduce the waste and 
food scraps from Marketplaces to 
improve drainage and enhance water 
quality.

BENEFICIARIES: 

City dwellers particularly the Canal 
Side Traders and consumers.

Marketplaces generate high volumes of general and food waste daily, much of 
which flows into nearby watercourses, interrupting drainage and significantly 
decreasing water quality. In many markets, wastewater from residential and 
commercial areas is connected to the canal system, further degrading water 
quality and polluting the surrounding environment. This project will focus on waste 
and wastewater management from marketplaces to improve water quality and 
drainage. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION  

This project will be implemented through a community-based approach, engaging 
directly with marketplaces and their vendors to better understand barriers to 
sustainable waste management. At the outset, a range of different solutions will be 
considered, ranging from awareness campaigns centred on waste and wastewater 
disposal, to introducing new wastewater collection and treatment systems, along 
with accompanying training in how to use these systems effectively. The project 
will also draw on expertise from the 100RC network on innovative models for 
funding new initiatives where increased cost may be a major barrier to uptake.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

The volume of garbage in the canals 
from the communities will be reduced 
to facilitate effective navigation and 
drainage, and improve water quality 
and amenity for the community. It will 
also increase the attractiveness of the 
area for tourism.

Once known as the Venice of the East, the city of Bangkok still has a number of 
canals that are used for transportation and drainage. However, the canals often 
have reduced functionality due to excessive garbage dumping particularly by the 
communities residing by the canals. This project intends to review the management 
of waste collection in community areas along the canals, reducing the amount of 
garbage in the canals and ensuring the proper navigation and drainage capacity of 
the canals is restored.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

A community-based approach will be adopted to develop and encourage the use 
of a waste management system across the communities living alongside selected 
canals. A number of actions including awareness building on waste dumping, and 
improvement of waste facilities will be implemented as part of this project.

4.3.3 IMPROVEMENT OF DRAINAGE SYSTEMS ALONG MAIN ROADS

Proper drainage is important for a city like Bangkok where flooding is a common 
phenomenon. Many drainage pipes are too small for the volume of water they 
now receive and are irregularly maintained, creating water logging problems in 
many city areas. This project aims to improve drainage facilities in selected areas 
through infrastructure intervention. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

Drainage and sewage system improvement through the construction of new 
drains and replacement of old pipes as required. This will be founded on a 
detailed program of technical investigations to determine where investment 
will be most effective. The project will also seek opportunities to maximise 
the benefits of ground-disturbing works, such as co-location underground of 
electrical wires where possible.

TIMELINE:

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

This initiative will ensure there are 
redundant facilities to increase 
drainage capacity and reduce flood in 
city area and on road surface.  

BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents of the City of Bangkok.

Underground tunnels are currently being used to mitigate floods and waterlogging 
in Bangkok. These tunnels provide a shortcut to direct excessive water in the 
city area to the Chao Praya River for quick discharge. This helps reduce the time 
it takes for water to drain through connected drainage pipe systems and canal 
systems, significantly increasing efficiency of water drainage and reducing the risk 
of flooding. With the capacity to discharge high volumes of water, underground 
tunnels could also be used for canal water cleaning, by flushing water to wash 
away wastes and dilute pollution in canals. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This project forms one part of a multifaceted approach to building redundancy into 
Bangkok’s water management system. Apart from the existing seven underground 
tunnels currently operating, and two under construction, another four underground 
tunnels will be constructed – two in Bangkok’s east, as well as two in the west.
As with the drainage systems project, this project will apply systems thinking 
to maximise the benefits that can be generated by this major infrastructure 
investment.

4.3.5 IMPROVEMENT OF MAJOR CANALS 

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Drainage and Sewerage Department, 
BMA and Ministry of Social 
Development and Human Security 

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

This initiative will help reduce 
settlement along water ways and 
canals, resulting in increased drainage 
capacity and water flow during heavy 
rainfall or flood periods. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents of the City of Bangkok and 
settlements on the canals.

Encroachment of canals or ‘klongs’ has been one of the major causes for water 
logging in Bangkok. Squatter settlements along the waterways have severely 
obstructed water flow, making a number of canals unable to function at optimal 
drainage capacity. The built up and densely populated environment of formal 
and informal settlements along canals has contributed to water pollution through 
household waste water discharge further deteriorating water quality in city. This 
problem is in part due to limited availability of affordable housing in urban areas 
that drives those with low incomes to informal settlements along the canals. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This project will take an integrated and holistic approach to the challenges 
facing our city’s canals, particularly in the areas of water regulation and waste 
management.

This will include challenging processes and decisions, such as the possible 
relocation of informal settlements to new areas; this will be managed in an inclusive 
way, providing these vulnerable communities a voice in the decision-making 
process. Other activities may include expanding canals and clearing to increase 
water drainage and storage capacity, and building reinforced concrete dams to 
regulate water flow of nine major canals in Bangkok Metropolitan Region - Klong 
Lad Prao, Klong Prem Prachakorn, Klong Bangkhen, Klong Bang Sue, Klong Pravet 
Burirom, Kong Phra Kanong, Klong Sam Wa, Kong Lad Buakhao and Kong Praya 
Rachmontri. 

Linking closely with the strategy goals around waste management, the project will 
also review the management of waste collection in remaining community areas 
along the canals, with a view to better understanding areas of need and how the 
needs of these communities can be more effectively met, thereby generating flow-
on benefits for other Bangkok residents.

ACTION AREA 24.3.6 STUDY OF THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING COMBINED UTILITY TUNNELS

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Public Works Department, Drainage and 
Sewage Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

The result of the study will be helpful 
to understand appropriate and cost-
effectives structures, functions, and 
management of utility tunnels hosting 
multiple services’ infrastructure 
supporting the integrated and robust 
underground space development of 
Bangkok. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

The residents and businesses of 
Bangkok.

Multiple service infrastructures located underground has made it difficult and costly 
to implement infrastructure upgrades, maintenance and replacement. Drainage 
pipes, water, electricity, and communication lines, as well as subway tunnels, cross 
each other in a disordered manner and sometimes obstruct each other, which 
can result in dangerous and structural malfunction. Additionally, the streets and 
pavements of Bangkok are constantly undergoing excavation, causing impacts on 
traffic, and producing noise, dust and air pollution. As there is an urgent need to 
upgrade Bangkok’s aging sewerage system and drainage pipelines, it is crucial that 
Bangkok put in place an underground development plan for combined tunnels as a 
sustainable development solution.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This initiative will be implemented based on in-depth research into the feasibility, 
application, cost effectiveness, and comparative advantage of combined utility 
tunnels. The study will consider economic, financial and environmental aspects 
related to the tunnels, and also look into possible locations and prioritized areas 
for developing combined utility tunnel infrastructures, service life, different designs 
and sizes. The study will produce: guidelines on how to enhance the capacity of 
underground utility systems, the costs and benefits of using a combined utilities 
tunnel, and a prototype for the utility tunnels.

- LINKING PEOPLE 
AND SPACES AND 
INCREASING ACCESS 
TO WATERWAYS 

Klong Ong Ang is one of the oldest remaining canals 
in Bangkok, dating back more than 200 years, 
constructed by King Rama I. In fact, elderly resident 
Wisuth Lertsuphanimitre points to a big tree by the 
canal he claimed was planted during King Rama V’s 
reign, signifying that the community may be more than 
a century old [15].
 
Over the years, the area had become overrun with 
illegal stalls and garbage, leading to deteriorating 
water quality. With the support of the local community, 
the waterway was recently restored by the Bangkok 
Metropolitan Administration. The restoration involved 
removing 500 illegal stalls (that once crowded the 
area and restricted pedestrian movement), landscape 
improvements, garbage removal and water treatment. 

The area now has a two kilometre pedestrian walkway 
along the canal bank. The Bangkok Post reported that 
“according to the vendors, sales should be much better 
than before as the new walkway will be more spacious, 
orderly and will attract lots of people to come.” [15]. 
It also noted that “residents living near and along the 
canal were completely behind the move to reclaiming 
public areas and improve the city’s scenery.” [15] 
Residents noted that the “stalls at the old market were 
a serious fire risk,” and that the restoration will “bring 
back a sense of life and enjoyment to the area.”[15]

The Flood Resilience Index (FRI) helps cities to understand their vulnerability to 
flooding and other resilience characteristics in a specified area, informing decisions 
around how best to intervene and enhance resilience.  This project will apply the 
FRI to assess and determine the resilience of Bangkok to flood, focusing on highly 
urbanized areas, with Sukumvit as pilot location. Applying the FRI will also allow 
for the comparison of Sukumvit’s level of flood resilience to other cities in Europe 
and Asia, and inform BMA on sensitive areas and effective ways to take action. 

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND  IMPLEMENTATION: 

An understanding of flood resilience 
can help decision makers design 
appropriate interventions to reduce 
flood risk, increase economic 
productivity and better ensure the 
safety and movement of residents 
with less disruption.

BENEFICIARIES:

Covering over 24 square kilometers and comprising approximately 1,000 buildings, 
Sukumvit will be used as a case study for the application of FRI. This will include 
assessment at different spatial scales including macro (city or district), block, and 
micro (building), plus consideration of the five key elements of urban systems: 
physical, natural, economic, social and institutional. The assessment will produce a 
GIS database and map, which will help in identifying the weak points of the study

GOAL 5: INCREASE 
PUBLIC AND 
COMMUNITY 
DRIVEN ACTION 
ON AWARENESS, 
PREPAREDNESS AND 
ADAPTATION

Apart from flood, Bangkok is exposed to a number of 
different shocks and stresses which affect city residents. 
Many of these are likely to be exacerbated by climate 
change. It is important that our communities have 
the knowledge and skills to enable them to cope with 
these shocks and stresses. Additionally, community 
participation will complement all other BMA initiatives 
on urban resilience. Effective communication systems 
through multiple channels and networks will improve 
promptness in emergency monitoring, alertness and 
responsiveness. BMA along with the communities at risk 
will implement the following initiatives:
•  Community-based adaptation and disaster 

preparedness and communication; 

•  Making better use of technology for public 
communication and disaster preparedness.

KNOWLEDGE SHARING WITH BERKELEY
Like Bangkok, Berkeley is working towards building a 
connected and prepared community. It is launching 
a Community Resilience Centre Program, which will 
provide disaster planning assistance and disaster supply 
‘caches’ to local community-based organizations that 
are connecting with a range of communities, including 
some of the city’s most vulnerable.

Berkeley is also fostering neighbour-to-neighbour 
connections to advance disaster readiness. They are 
achieving this by partnering with local community 
leaders and an NGO to identify local organizers at 
the neighbourhood level (Neighbourhood Disaster 
Preparedness Liaisons). 

To achieve the goal of increased public and community 
driven action on awareness, preparedness and 
adaptation, Bangkok is also looking to work with 
communities by empowering local community members 
as facilitators to help build disaster preparedness 
capacity in their community. Bangkok will also explore 
a number of means for communicating disaster risks, 
including a mobile phone application. The 100RC 
network offers significant potential for Bangkok and 
Berkeley cities to learn from each other as they move 
forward with implementation of their strategies.

PROMOTES INTEGRATED DISASTER PREPAREDNESS IN COMMUNITIES BY FACILITATING COMMUNITY-BASED 
AND SCHOOL-BASED ADAPTATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT, STARTING WITH RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS ON 
PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION AGAINST FLOODING AND OTHER HAZARDS.

5.1.1 COMMUNITY-BASED DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT PILOT

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Fire and Rescue Department of BMA, 
Asian Disaster Preparedness Center 
(ADPC) and National Institute of 
Development Administration (NIDA)

The changing climate will increase disaster risks globally, this is especially the 
case for a mega city like Bangkok with high population density in an extremely 
urbanized area. The Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM) 
project aims to raise awareness and build capacities of communities to be resilient 
from disasters and the changing climate, and promote economic and equitable 
adaptation.

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

Pilot communities have knowledge 
and skills to cope with disaster and 
the ability to adapt to uncertainties 
brought about by climate change and 
other hazards.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Pilot communities, relevant agencies 
in Bangkok and Department of 
Disaster Prevention and Mitigation 
to have new model and maintian 
disaster relief budget.  

The initiative will identify and establish a network of CBDRM leaders/facilitators. 
These people will build capacity on disaster and climate risk management 
directly with their communities, acting as a trusted advisor who can help develop 
community action plans and formalize community networks to build resilience. 
Additionally, CBDRM facilitators will help identify and mobilize shared resources 
(e.g. those with valuable skills that can be drawn upon by other community 
members in response to a shock event). Establishing facilitators for different 
communities will help ensure the solutions are right for each community, as well as 
being developed with the meaningful input of local people.

The project will also conduct feasibility studies on community-based solar roof 
energy sources to provide communities with redundancy during a disaster event

The learning centre for earthquake 
and other hazards will be a 
knowledge-based resource that 
enhances the culture of safety among 
the general public.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Residents, students, and general 
public.

Fire is a common hazard in the city, resulting in loss of property and lives. 
However, Bangkok has also been known to suffer the impacts of seismic force 
from neighbouring epicentres. Given that the city is situated on water-saturated, 
unconsolidated soil, collapsed structures triggered by earthquakes occurring 
in other regions are anticipated, though our ability to predict when and where 
these impacts will occur is limited. Risk awareness, precautionary measures and 
structural mitigation for earthquake-resistant construction are crucial to reducing 
catastrophic impacts and saving lives. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

Bangkok’s first Disaster Learning Centre will be designed and constructed at 
the Fire and Rescue Department of BMA to provide learning opportunities on 
earthquake and fire hazards. The aim of this centre will be to engage with the 
public on the dangers and possible harmful impacts of disasters, how to react 
and survive in unexpected circumstances and tips for safety. The centre will also 
demonstrate BMA’s disaster management capacity to build confidence and sense 
of security for residents and foreigners.

GOAL 6: STRONGER 
INSTITUTIONAL 
CAPACITY AND 
REGULATION 

Striving to make Bangkok safer to live for all, BMA, 
as the primary agency for city administration, must 
be fully versed in disaster mitigation, preparedness, 
response and recovery. Complex urbanization and 
multi-layer facilities and systems to run city functions 
make urban disaster management a unique discipline 
that requires a mix of expertise and practical skills to 
address. 

Considering the shocks Bangkok is likely to encounter, 
advancing disaster management systems and practices 
are essential for city authorities to be able to address 
multiple shocks and related emergency situations in a 
more effective, comprehensive and harmonized manner, 
better protecting people and their assets as well as 
social stability and the wider economy. 

The capacity and capabilities of BMA to be able to 
reduce risks in Bangkok need to be assured, especially 
their ability to carry out emergency operations which 
require practical knowledge and skills. Certain areas 
that the city should target for capacity development 
include search and rescue, emergency drills in a 
given scenario, coordination mechanisms, and 
communications. Bangkok will also seek to promote 
collaboration and experience sharing with different 
partners within the country and in the region. The 
in-house capacity of BMA, equipped with modern 
equipment and necessary resources to effectively 
respond to emergency situations will be strengthened 
through:
•  Capacity building for disaster risk reduction in BMA

• 

Resources and infrastructure for better 
preparedness and response.

KNOWLEDGE SHARING WITH DA NANG
Da Nang is focusing on building the capacity of the 
city’s municipal workforce to enhance its ability to 
respond to disasters. Over the next few years, it 
will enhance city officer capacity in natural disaster 
forecasting and early warning, and improve action plans 
for typhoon preparedness, response and recovery. 

Similarly, Bangkok is committed to building capacity 
for disaster risk reduction in BMA. In an increasingly 
urbanised city, an area of weakness Bangkok has 
identified in BMA’s capacity is in urban search, rescue 
and fire training. Bangkok is also committed to sharing 
knowledge and learning from its neighbouring cities 
about disaster prevention and mitigation, including 
through the ASEAN city network and the 100RC 
network with Da Nang. Further collaboration between 
Bangkok and Da Nang will be investigated during 
implementation of this strategy.   

WORKING WITH JAKARTA 
Bangkok and Jakarta share a number of resilience 
challenges. As rapidly developing, south-east Asian 
mega-cities, both are threatened by frequent flooding 
and face significant issues with mobility and rapidly 
growing inequality. There are significant opportunities 
for Bangkok and Jakarta to work closely together 
through the 100RC network to share lessons learned, 
particularly as Bangkok approaches implementation 
just as Jakarta is kicking off its resilience strategy 
process. The first steps have been taken to establish 
this relationship, with Dr Supachai Tantikom featuring 
as a panellist at the Jakarta Agenda Setting Workshop. 
This relationship will be further developed as each city 
moves further along its resilience journey.  

ACTION AREA 26.1 CAPACITY BUILDING FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

While Bangkok has put in place Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Plans and other 
emergency operation plans, how and to what extent the plans could be run in an 
actual disaster situation remains uncertain. To translate these plans into action, it is 
necessary to ensure that all concerned are able to apply procedures, measures and 
steps in timely and effective manners, with role clarity, operating systems up and 
running, mechanisms in place for coordination and communication, and necessary 
resources pre-identified and readily available. 

Government officials, NGOs, volunteer groups, and others with roles in disaster 
management will work together in joint exercises that will better equip them to 
understand and effectively apply their respective functions. These exercises will 
build trust and confidence, as well as helping to identify gaps and overlaps in 
accountabilities in a safe-to-fail environment. These exercises will be informed by 
extensive engagement with Bangkok citizens, residents, schools and business to 
understand how each organization’s role responds to community needs.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

A series of training sessions, emergency exercises, and drills will be conducted 
by BMA to test functions and roles of assigned staff, volunteers and concerned 
agencies according to operational procedures and action plans, based on a 
comprehensive review of staff skills and capacities. Emergency operation systems 
and mechanisms for timely and effective delivery of disaster prevention, mitigation 
and emergency operations will be developed. Evacuation plans and drills will be 
conducted with the participation of communities, schools and businesses, enabling

ECONOMY

Bangkok is currently experiencing slow economic 
growth due to several domestic and external factors 
including political instability, low investor confidence 
and private investment lagging behind public 
investment. However, Bangkok has a number of 
avenues for growing its economy to the benefit of all 
Bangkokians. BMA will proactively increase economic 
competitiveness and widen opportunity through: 
• 

Supporting economic resilience through: 

• 

Establishing Bangkok as a centre for trade and 
finance

•  Developing and preserving agriculture in the city 

LEARNING FROM SEMARANG AND 
GLASGOW  
A number of Bangkok’s peers on the 100RC network 
are grappling with the economic empowerment of their 
residents and businesses in the wake of shocks such 
as recession or natural disasters, and stresses such as 
poverty, economic downturn and disparities between 
rich and poor. 
Through the promotion of urban farming and eco-
tourism Semarang is taking action to develop 
environmentally friendly and socially orientated 
businesses. Much like Bangkok, it is looking at how it 
can the city’s existing spaces and services can be used 
or improved in different and innovative ways. 
In the wake of recession and transitioning from an 
industrial economy, Glasgow is taking numerous actions 
around skills development and small businesses. Among 
these actions are programs to increase the skill levels 
of Glasgow’s working age population with a view to 
transitioning from manufacturing roles, and supporting 
new and existing business to grow. 
As Bangkok, Semarang and Glasgow work to implement 
these actions, there is great opportunity to share 
experiences and lessons learnt through the 100RC 
network.

IS BEING ENCROACHED UPON BY WIDESPREAD URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND THOSE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL 
DISADVANTAGE. PATHWAYS TOWARDS A MORE RESILIENT BANGKOK WILL ENSURE INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT 
THAT WORKS WITH SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND HOW 
CURRENT APPROACHES ARE LEAVING THEM FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. BMA WILL WORK WITH TARGETED 
COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE WAYS TO BECOMING MORE SELF-RELIANT BY CREATING INCOME EARNING ACTIVITIES 
AND CAREER CHOICES, IMPROVING ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES AND PROMOTING THE RETENTION 
OF ARABLE LAND TO SECURE AGRICULTURAL LIVELIHOODS IN THE CITY. THESE WILL ALSO PROVIDE VALUABLE 
FLOOD MITIGATION AND RETENTION AREAS. 

7.1.1 ENHANCING RESILIENCE OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN BANGKOK THROUGH 
INTEGRATED FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL SUPPORT   

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Fire and Rescue Department, 
Drainage and Sewerage Department, 
Local District Offices of BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Social and economic disparity 
of vulnerable communities are 
addressed in an integrated and 
holistic way, which exhibits co-
efficiency with other actions. 

Within Bangkok, there is a significant gap between the disadvantaged and 
advantaged. Among the disadvantaged are domestic migrants, labourers (local 
and foreign), city nomads and squatters. Other vulnerable groups include the 
elderly, disabled and children whose living condition is deteriorating due to factors 
like unemployment, poverty, poor health outcomes and inadequate housing, all of 
which reduces their capacity to find and maintain a living.

Disregarding these people will only reduce the liveability of Bangkok and increase 
our resilience challenges, as vulnerable residents are less likely able to support 
themselves when disaster strikes. This action will seek to address a wide range of 
social and livelihood needs in vulnerable segments of the city’s population, making 
the city more equitable and inclusive. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

Local communities and urban 
population, especially the socially and 
economically disadvantaged.

BMA will engage with identified disadvantaged communities in Bangkok to 
understand their needs and get their input into the design of support services 
in a wide range of areas. These include accessible and affordable public utilities, 
education and technologies to meet basic needs that underpin resilience. Financial 
support and knowledge transfer will also be provided based on community-driven 
needs to start community-based economies and micro-businesses that can help 
strengthen networks, economic security, and social cohesion in the long run.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Social Development Department, 
District Offices,  Department of City 
Planning, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Agricultural areas in Bangkok will be 
further developed for co-effective 
outcomes that increase economic 
value and earning of urban farming 
communities, land preservation for 
ecological service and temporary 
water storage, and environmental 
heritage of the city.

BENEFICIARIES: 

Agricultural communities in Bangkok.

The expansion of Bangkok’s built environment has encroached on fertile land 
which was once used for farming activities. These areas supported a common 
agrarian way of life, but only 13,774 farming households across 26 of 50 districts 
remaian. Recognising the importance of agriculture as an important livelihood 
for some Bangkok residents, both in terms of food production and tourism, is 
important to Bangkok’s history, as well as its ability to provide green infrastructure 
for flood protection This project will help the city retain its remaining agricultural 
areas. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

Bangkok will take an integrated and participatory approach to promoting urban 
agriculture and sustainable farming practices on preserved farm land in the city. 
The action will look at maximising the multiple land-use and co-benefits of farming 
through residential areas, communities’ interaction and flood protection. 
This project will use integrated planning to enhance adaptive capacity and provide 
planned incentives that allow alternate use of urban farm lands for multiple 
purposes including cropping, water retention, urban-agro tourism, and preserving 
biological diversity and ecological services. An agricultural sector development 
plan for Bangkok will be developed through a community consultation process. It 
will consider a range of options to support farming livelihoods, ensure sufficient 
earning of households relying on framing practices, and optimise land resources 
through flexible and integrated use of farm land.

7.2 ESTABLISHING BANGKOK AS A CENTRE FOR TRADE AND 
FINANCE

THE INTERCONNECTED NATURE OF THE DOMESTIC, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMY CREATES VULNERABILITY 
FOR BANGKOK, BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITY. BANGKOK MUST BE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH EVER-CHANGING 
ECONOMIC FORCES AND TRENDS, AND TURN RISK FACTORS INTO POSITIVE DRIVERS FOR ITS ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT. A KEY FACTOR FOR BANGKOK’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STABILITY WILL BE ITS CAPACITY TO 
ACCURATELY FORECAST AN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, THROUGH THE IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF LOCAL AND 
GLOBAL TRENDS. 

7.2.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF BANGKOK ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CENTRE FOR TRADE, 
FINANCE

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Finance Department, Strategy and 
Evaluation Department, Bangkok 
Metropolitan Administration, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

The initiative will empower BMA 
towards fostering economic 
prosperity by enabling BMA to 
address economic impacts from 
shocks and stresses, realizing city 
economic growth and expanding 
further opportunity for economic 
competitiveness. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

Local community,  domestic and 
international entrepreneurs, business 
partners/owners and investors. 

As a major centre for investment, trade, travel and logistics, both nationally and 
globally, Bangkok has great potential to enjoy ongoing economic competitiveness 
and be a truly global city. 
This requires a specialized and dedicated body to coordinate economic 
development in Bangkok – one that will set strategic directions and coordinate 
the many different players to collectively explore, collaborate and make decisions 
about economic opportunities.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The Economic Development Centre for Trade, Finance and Investment will be 
established as an affiliated body of BMA and tasked with all economic-oriented 
aspects of city development and support in realising Bangkok city’s aspiration, as 
articulated in its 20 year plan, to become a ‘City of Economy and Knowledge-Base 
for Asia in 2030.’ 

The centre will be established to drive Bangkok’s economic prosperity by better 
addressing economic issues and challenges, expanding trade and investment 
opportunities, promoting government-to-government and public-private  
partnerships based on shared benefit, economic equity and justice, and imbedding 
sufficiency economy theory for sustainable growth. Comprising a joint-committee 
for management from different departments, units and district offices of BMA, 
economic analysts, and financial experts, the centre will perform interim functions 
in tackling immediate economic issues and challenges. BMA will also develop 
a framework for long-term and permanent status of the centre, with defined 
mandates and functions, scope of services, staff resourcing, and necessary budget 
to enable success.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Finance Department, Social 
Development Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

BMA could be able to guide 
business plan and strategies for local 
entrepreneurs and business, based on  
economic analysis. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

BMA officials and officials of 50 
districts, local entrepreneurs, and 
SMEs.

While Bangkok has enjoyed economic vibrancy and investment in various sectors 
including commercial property, tourism hospitality services, many other sectors 
have the potential to boot the city economy but have not been actively supported 
to realise their potential. 
With a great diversity of economic activities in Bangkok, it is important that BMA 
and its district offices play a strong leading role in initiating and implementing 
proactive policy options and measures to facilitate and support trade, finance, and 
investment of different scales based on core-business compentencies, available 
production factors, and resources and skills in respective localities. This project 
will strongly contribute to ongoing attempts to achieve the economic aspiration 
outlined in Bangkok’s 20-Year Development Plan (2013-2032). 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

BMA and the city’s 50 District Offices will take a leading role in guiding and 
facilitating Bangkok’s economic development.  To fulfil this role, 300 BMA officials 
will undertake training and skills development on a range of relevant topics related 
to expanding finance and economic opportunities in the city. 
The objective of this program is to develop an understanding of the economy, 
trade, finance and investment at the community and city scale and to equip BMA 
to build broader economic partnerships with its fellow ASEAN countries. These 
officers will serve as part of the Economic Development Centre for Trade, Finance 
and Investment outlined as part of this initiative.

7.2.3 REDUCING RISK OF ECONOMIC SHOCKS 

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Finance Department, Social 
Development Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Bangkok and its residents have 
better options through readiness 
and remediation to reduce potential 
economic impacts. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

Bangkok and its resident. 

Bangkok’s economy is influenced by a variety of factors including global and 
regional economic crises and changes in demand and other economic trends. 
Similarly, negative consequences of large scale hazards such as floods, disease 
pandemics, and major fire accidents in the city area do not only cause severe 
interruption of business activities or damage of economic infrastructure, but also 
undermine confidence among both domestic and foreign investors. 
Technological advancement has the potential to improve efficiency in the 
workplace, however, it may also have unintended consequences. For example, 
automation may lead to a decreased demand for manual labour and hence 
cause unemployment. As a result potential mechanisms for efficiency should be 
thoroughly investigated.  
 
ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

The Finance Department of BMA will take proactive actions to build a resilient 
economy by putting in place a Bangkok Economic Plan to address projected 
economic challenges in a timely and sustainable way. 

Comprehensive studies will be carried out to develop a critical understanding of a 
range of risk factors, including the impact of emerging economic trends, such as 
increased automation and technological advancement at regional and global scale 
on Bangkok’s current economic activities and structures. 
While the future will be inherently unpredictable, this work remains important for 
BMA’s capacity to forecast and plan for expected future conditions, and make 
informed decisions on preparedness and mitigation options to turn challenges into 
opportunities.

ACTION AREA 3GOAL 8: EXPANDING 
TOURISM, SERVICE 
INDUSTRY AND 
HOSPITALITY  

As a world-famous tourist destination, Bangkok’s 
tourism industry has significant opportunities for further 
growth to provide visitors with a fun, easy, vibrant, 
safe and culturally relevant visitor experience. BMA 
will support potential actors in developing business 
models and ways to upgrade tourism related services 
to an acceptable standard as well as improve tourist 
safety in order to expand its tourism markets. This is 
important for the economic and social resilience of the 
city, and the country, as the tourism industry of Thailand 
is responsible for 19 per cent of the country’s GDP [14]. 
Bangkok will further expand its tourism, service industry 
and hospitality offer through: 
- Providing skills development for tourism operators 
- Enhancing tourist safety

DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
CULTURAL MARKET IN 
THE CITY, INCLUDING 
TOURISM OPERATORS 
AND PRODUCTS 

Developing expertise for local tourism businesses 
and hospitality services is central to optimizing the 
value of tourism in Bangkok. Communities with rich 
cultural heritage and craft skills will be equipped with 
entrepreneurship and business management skills to 
assist them in growing their businesses and Bangkok’s 
cultural attractions. BMA will take action to promote 
cultural tourism, together with local communities, by 
implementing community-inclusive business models 
through these three projects.

8.1 PROVIDING SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FOR TOURISM 
OPERATORS.

TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF BANGKOK’S MANY TOURISM OPERATORS, A PROGRAM OF 
TRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE DESIGNED AND OFFERED TO OPERATORS TO BUILD THEIR BUSINESS 
AND ENSURE THEIR OPERATIONS MEET THE STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF VISITORS TO THE CITY.

8.1.1 TRAINING PROGRAM FOR TOURISM VENDORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS 

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Culture, Sport and Tourism 
Development, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

Greater opportunities for Bangkok’s 
tourism industry to offer a range of 
options and types of services for 
tourists and visitors with diverse 
tastes, interest and preference. This 
will contribute to further growth of 
the tourism sector.   

BENEFICIARIES: 

Tourism service providers, vendors, 
local communities and residents. 

While Bangkok has wide array of tourism products and services to offer, a range 
of potential stakeholders owning cultural assets have limited understanding and 
know-how to build upon the existing rich heritage. Small-scale business owners, 
local street vendors and communities around Bangkok with unique catering, 
lodging, cultural experiences should be supported to develop their businesses and 
to be aware of, and meet standards and expectations of tourists in the city. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

BMA will provide capacity development programs for business owners, service 
providers, vendors and communities to assure quality tourism products and service 
delivery, and entrepreneurial opportunities for these businesses. Special focus will 
be on training of small and medium sized tourism-related enterprises and local 
communities, with guidelines, practical tools and processes for promoting and 
preserving cultural heritage for tourism purposes, business planning for cultural 
products and related businesses management.

of tourism promotion, upgrading industry services and ensuring quality and 
regulatory standards. This requires strategic analysis, insight, and inclusive and 
forward-thinking planning. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

This project will develop a roadmap based on analysis of the challenges and 
opportunities for tourism in Bangkok. BMA will facilitate the development of the 
tourism sector through a series of interrelated, prioritized interventions with role 
clarity of lead and supporting agencies and stakeholder mapping, while focusing 
on the role of culture for tourism development as one of key areas for tourism 
promotion.

8.1.3 MODEL OF MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL PRODUCT FOR TOURISM 
PROMOTION (PILOT FOR BANGKOK NOI DISTRICT)

IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND 
PARTNERS: 

Cultures, Sport and Tourism 
Department, BMA

RESILIENCE VALUE & OUTCOMES: 

This pilot project will demonstrate 
how tourist attractions can be 
developed in local communities 
to showcase traditional lifestyles 
or cultural practices and to build 
economic opportunities for 
communities. This model can then 
be used by other communities 
to develop their own attractions 
and business models furthering 
economic development supporting 
the expansion of the tourism sector in 
Bangkok. 

BENEFICIARIES: 

Communities owning cultural heritage 
and culture-related assets, cultural 
tourism service providers. 

The tourism industry of Thailand is responsible for 19% of the country’s GDP. 
Bangkok, as a gateway for tourism in Thailand, is a major tourist’s attraction with 
rich history and abundant cultural heritage, combined with modernized facilities 
and amenities. Opportunities still exist for Bangkok to showcase its cultural 
diversity and heritage by offering visitors a unique, hands on experience of some of 
its traditional communities.

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

BMA will further promote cultural tourism by developing a model for cultural 
tourism enterprise creation in Bangkok Noi District. This will be used to 
demonstrate how practical plans and activities for the development of cultural and 
community tourism can be developed, replicated and adapted to other potential 
tourism locations. This project will showcase the process of identifying potential 
communities or other cultural experiences, marketing strategies, and sustainable 
management of cultural tourism. Participation of communities, local service 
providers and cultural-tourism related business owners will be key for long-term 
mutual profit, including social development for communities, businesses and social 
equity.

community  and  residents.

Bangkok has a large amount of visitors each year. Tourist safety and security is a 
significant consideration for the city and tourists are currently provided with access 
to various types of assistance such as tourist police and tourist service centres. 

ACTIVITIES IN BRIEF AND IMPLEMENTATION: 

BMA will further increase efforts to ensure that essential segments of the tourism 
industry, including transportation, accommodation, tourist attractions, and other 
related services, thoroughly consider safety and security of visitors as part of 
their business planning activities. In this endeavour, BMA will provide businesses 
with access to information through online, up-to-date situation alerts from 
reliable sources in times of emergency, and channels for lodging complaints and 
responding to tourist grievances.

NEXT STEPS

Our city is on a journey, one that will see it grow to be a safe, 
liveable and sustainable city for all its residents. This Strategy 
is an important milestone on this journey. It marks the 
beginning of a resilience building approach that will plan and 
resource actions that address those things that are important 
to our city and not just those that are the most urgent, 
breaking the cycle of being reactive instead of resilient. Now 
that we have identified what is at the heart of our city’s ability 
to be resilient, the time has come for us to roll up our sleeves 
and together, plan how we will transform our dynamic vision 
into successful implementation. 

Bangkok is committed to delivering the 18 initiatives with 57 
projects, identified in this Strategy.  Not all of these will be 
delivered in the first year, or even the second. Some will be 
complete within the first year, whilst others will continue on 
for many years to come. The details of this implementation 
program will be covered in an implementation plan, to be 
developed immediately following the release of this Strategy. 

Bangkok has learnt from other cities in the 100RC network 
that resilience projects, by their very nature, cross silos, 
sectors and agencies. Their implementation therefore 
requires collaboration and buy-in across multiple agencies 
to ensure that these agencies can work together to leverage 
investments, engage effectively with the community and 
deliver coordinated and transparent benefits to Bangkok 
residents. Implementation agencies and partners will therefore 
be heavily involved in the development of an implementation 
plan to ensure coordination, streamline delivery and leverage 
investments for multiple resilience benefits.  

Together with our partners, we invite you to come and share 
the journey.
