INTRODUCTION.

LETTER FROM  
MAYOR ABOUTALEB

Rotterdam is a city to be proud of – and I am extremely 
proud of Rotterdam! The tiny settlement of ‘Rotta’ at the 
Rotte river bank has, over the course of centuries, grown 
into the major city of today. Rotterdam has its citizens 
to thank for that, from the early settlers to the current 
residents. The people of Rotterdam utilized the city’s 
location and its potential to the fullest, turning the water 
of the Rotterdam delta from its biggest threat into its 
greatest opportunity. They seized opportunities presented 
by trade and fishery. They embraced plans by visionaries 
such as Pieter Caland, whose ‘Nieuwe Waterweg’ (New 
Waterway) established the city’s direct connection to the 
North Sea. 

Rotterdam’s history is marked by its residents’ resilience. 
Challenges were overcome, in water management, 
trade, fighting cholera epidemics, and in literally re–
constructing the city after a devastating bombardment at 
the start of the Second World War left much of the city 
in ruins. Rotterdam has always faced difficult situations 
by looking to the future and finding opportunities for city 
improvement; ‘stronger through struggle’ is our motto.
In May 2013 I met Judith Rodin, the Rockefeller 
Foundation’s CEO, in New York City. The great 
importance of resilience, in relation to the economic 
structure and livability of cities was recognized by 
her organization. Global developments, such as 
urbanization, climate change and the increasing 
complexity of urban society tell us we must look ahead 
and be prepared. The 100 Resilient Cities initiative was 
born.

She encouraged me to join the cities at the forefront, 
exploring the meaning of resilience for Rotterdam, and 
discovering the ways in which we can continue to build 
on our historical accomplishments. I embraced the 

invitation with conviction. Rotterdam has always shown 
resilience, but innovative cities remain successful by being 
future–driven, rather than coasting on past successes. 
The people of Rotterdam are the key to the resiliency of 
their city. Their agility and resilience are crucial when 
disaster strikes. The memories of Paris and Brussels are 
still fresh. Continuing work on an inclusive Rotterdam 
society will further increase its resilience and provide 
balance. Developments in technology and society 
continue to challenge our resilience as well. The 
knowledge and skills necessary to deal with these new 
challenges are essential in order to keep moving ahead.
The urgency of resilience is displayed in many areas. 
An example that stresses the urgency, in my opinion, is 
the growth, interconnectivity of and dependencies on 
ICT systems. This calls for ‘cyber resilience’: the ability 
of Rotterdam’s city and port area to keep functioning, 
despite disruptions that will surely occur.

I am very proud to present to you Rotterdam’s resilience 
strategy. This is only the beginning, not a blueprint. 
The strategy provides a new way of thinking, with new 
insights on how to further expand Rotterdam’s robustness, 
flexibility and inclusivity. 

I invite you to view your daily activities and your passions 
through the ‘resilience lens’ this strategy offers. How do 
your activities contribute to Rotterdam’s resilience? Share 
your views and experiences with us as city officials, with 
your colleagues and your fellow–citizens. For only by 
joining forces, can we make our city even stronger and 
more beautiful.

INTRODUCTION.

LETTER FROM  
MICHAEL BERKOWITZ 

The release of Rotterdam’s first–ever comprehensive 
Resilience Strategy is an evolutionary step forward for 
a city with a rich history of innovation and leadership. 
From its recovery after the destruction of World War II, 
to its globally recognized work on climate adaptation 
and water management, Rotterdam has time and again 
shown that it never shies away from confronting the most 
pressing challenges of the day head–on. The release of 
this strategy builds on this storied legacy. 

Through this strategy, Rotterdam is taking an honest and 
proactive view of its resilience challenges and opportunities, 
while laying the groundwork for important work ahead. It 
recognizes that Rotterdam must become resilient not just by 
fortifying its defences to a changing climate and rising seas, 
but also by building a more cohesive and inclusive society. 
This is especially evident in the strategy’s cross–cutting 
initiatives, which focus on finding multi–benefit solutions to 

08 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY 

climate, technological, and socio–economic risks that can 
achieve a resilience dividend for the city. 

Rotterdam has moved well beyond climate adaptation 
expertise to be at the cutting–edge of resilience topics 
such as building cyber resilience, and upgrading the 
landmark Peperklip Building. Specifically, renovations 
such as the Peperklip’s should provide an opportunity to 
establish a link between the municipality of Rotterdam, 
to jobs and social cohesion programs for its residents. 
If completed under current plans, the project has the 
potential to house one of Europe’s largest roof gardens.

Of course, none of this could have been possible without 
the strong support and vision of Mayor Aboutaleb. As one 
of the first members of 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by 
the Rockefeller Foundation, Mayor Aboutaleb established 
Rotterdam as a leader in our global network early in our 
engagement. His keen interest in our partnership catalyzed 
the energy and political will necessary to turn Rotterdam’s 
challenges into opportunities. A special thanks should also 
be extended to Rotterdam’s CRO, Arnoud Molenaar, who 
hosted 100 Resilient Cities’ first ever Network Exchange 
and led an extensive process of research, analysis, and 
stakeholder engagement over the past few years that 
resulted in the fantastic work we see today. 

Though this strategy represents the end of the strategic 
planning process in Rotterdam, it is only the beginning 
of the exciting work to come in the months and years 
ahead. And 100 Resilient Cities’ partnership with the City 
of Rotterdam is also just beginning. It is now that we can 
collectively begin implementing the actions and initiatives 
contained in the following pages, which will positively 
impact the lives of all of those who call Rotterdam home. 
From its willingness to engage with world–class service 
providers through the 100 Resilient Cities platform 
of partners like Microsoft, to its ability to export best 
practices across the globe, Rotterdam is well positioned 
to continue leading the global urban resilience revolution. 
We at 100 Resilient Cities could not be more pleased to 
be a partner in these efforts. 

BEST REGARDS,
MICHAEL BERKOWITZ
PRESIDENT, 100 RESILIENT CITIES — PIONEERED BY 
THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 

LETTER FROM 
ARNOUD MOLENAAR

Very few ‘Rotterdammers’ (citizens of Rotterdam) know, 
but Rotterdam is world–renowned for its adaptation 
to climate change. International delegations visit the 
city every week, to see for themselves how we handle 
management of dykes and levees, water management, 
rain and use of ground– and drinking water. Their tours 
include visits to our water squares, underground parking 
garages with a built–in water storage facilities and a 
rowing course that doubles as a water buffer, combining 
sports, recreation and water management. They may 
also stop to look at multifunctional dykes, experimental 
floating constructions or the internet system that allows us 
to monitor the entire city’s groundwater levels. 
Rotterdam’s leading position in climate adaptation 
helped local businesses to receive millions of dollars in 
commissions in the aftermath of the disastrous hurricanes 
Katrina in New Orleans and Sandy in New York. 
Rotterdam may proudly state: we make cities climate 
proof.

The climate change adaptation program we have been 
working on for more than a decade, is a good example 
of how to sustainably handle risks and threats. Of course, 
we have a long history of Dutch craftsmanship to build 
upon. Our approach is to keep threats at bay, even using 
them to Rotterdam’s advantage, increasing quality of life 
in our city and efficiency in our port. We do so because 
it is essential that the continuity of our city is preserved.
Our efforts on climate change adaptation were a 
reason for the Rockefeller Foundation to invite us to join 
their resilience challenge, so that we could share our 
experiences, expand our horizons and learn from other 
cities – on climate change, and all the other challenges 
facing cities today. 

This document is Rotterdam’s first Resilience Strategy. 
Our primary goal is to make resilience–thinking common 
practice in our city and part of our DNA. We do so 
for you and with you. Six themes and a wide range of 
inspiring initiatives, both new and operational, will help 
increase our city’s resilience. 

100 Resilient Cities helped us in our journey to develop 
this Resilience Strategy and we are very grateful for this 
support. Participation in the 100 Resilient Cities Network 
has further strengthened and expanded Rotterdam’s 
image as a well–prepared, innovative delta city. We look 

 “ROTTERDAM IS AN 
INNOVATIVE CITY 
THAT IS PREPARED 
FOR THE FUTURE.”

forward to contribute to – and benefitting from – the 100 
Resilient Cities network in the forthcoming years. And as 
Chief Resilience Office (CRO) I am very much looking 
forward to continuing the exchange on key resilience 
topics with my fellow CRO’s within the network.

WHAT IS RESILIENCE.

RESILIENCE IS IN 
OUR DNA!

“RESILIENCE DOESN’T NEED TO BE EXPLAINED TO 
THE PEOPLE OF ROTTERDAM. OUR PEOPLE ARE 
WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR VISION, STRENGTH, 
COURAGE AND PERSISTENCE. IT IS WHAT MAKES 
US ROTTERDAMMERS!”

ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY 
12 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY

From the laying of the fi rst foundations of the city, the 
spirit of resilience has been engrained in our psyche. 
Instead of fi ghting the water, we used it to our advantage, 
creating land, establishing a new waterway (Nieuwe 
Waterweg) and promoting our city and World–class port 
as the main gateway to Europe. Our city and our people 
have – throughout history – overcome numerous shocks 
and stresses. We have adopted the city motto “Stronger 
through struggle” (“Sterker door strijd”) – this was added 
to our coat of arms to remember the courage and the 
strength shown by the people of Rotterdam through 
World War II. Our city centre was destroyed during 
World War II, but we have recovered, and in 2015 our 
city was voted the best city centre in the Netherlands.
Rotterdam is now a thriving cosmopolitan city, with a 
wealth of cultures and ethnicities. Our citizens are among 
the happiest in the Netherlands. It is well known for its 
modern architecture and has a vibrant cultural scene 
with an eclectic variety of shops, attractions, festivals, 
restaurants and parks. It is home to Europe’s largest and 
one of the top ten most important ports in the world and 
from this naval and industrial heritage it is now emerging 
as an exciting and dynamic entrepreneurial hub. It is 
well served by top quality internationally renowned 
knowledge institutions and universities which help to 
ensure we have a highly skilled and agile workforce.
But as we refl ect on our past, we also foresee new 
risks and challenges in the future from, for example; 
digitization, climate change, the new economy and 
globalization. We know that we cannot become 
complacent and that these challenges need to be faced. 
We have a reputation for designing and engineering 
robust systems but we acknowledge that future risks might 
call for a different response – more fl exibility and greater 
inclusiveness – perhaps different governance and funding 
approaches. Ensuring Rotterdam’s ongoing resilience will 
be a challenge, but it’s one we are ready for. We know 
that the technological and societal changes of the 21st 
century will present new risks and opportunities but we 
want to fi ght for a sustainable, safe, united and healthy 
future for our city.

21ST CENTURY”

ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY 

adequately respond to these sometime unpredictable 
changes – to recover quickly and to bounce back to 
become stronger than before. Rotterdam, as a Delta 
city, contains a vast and successful port and industrial 
complex, is home to a diverse and growing population 
and is situated in one of the most open economies in 
the world. It is therefore exposed to – and needs to be 
ready to respond to – a number of important global, 
regional and local transitions. 

In the last 10 years Rotterdam has won international 
acclaim for its work on climate adaptation. Our water 
squares, underground car parks with huge rain retention 
basins, multifunctional dykes and floating constructions 
are often profiled in international press and in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and 
Hurricane Sandy in New York this experience has 
attracted millions of dollars of revenue for Rotterdam 
based companies. Our companies have a strong 
reputation for helping to climate proof cities!

We’re proud of our track record on managing water 
and climate risks but we recognize this is only one of the 
stresses that our city is facing. Over the last two years, 
with the support of 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by 
the Rockefeller Foundation, we have expanded our view 
of what city resilience means. We have begun to think 
of resilience in a much more holistic way, considering a 
broader range of shocks and stresses.

In developing our resilience strategy we’ve used the 
methodology and many of the tools developed by 100 
Resilient Cities, we’ve engaged with hundreds of local 
stakeholders, spoken to international specialists, held 
workshops, conducted research and worked hard to 
zero in on the areas that we believe require the most 
attention to take Rotterdam’s resilience to the next level. 
We’ve articulated our resilience challenge, developed 
a single integrated vision for a Resilient Rotterdam in 
2030, defined seven resilience goals and determined 

68 actions that we will work to take forward in the 
coming years. We would like to thank 100 Resilient 
Cities and all the contributors and supporters that have 
helped us to develop this document – Rotterdam’s first 
official Resilience Strategy. This is only the start; we still 
have a lot of work and further exploration to do, and 
we will need the engagement and collaboration from 
numerous city stakeholders to deliver on this vision. 

“CITIES THAT HAVE 
CONSIDERED THEIR 
RESILIENCE IN A 
HOLISTIC WAY WILL BE 
BETTER PREPARED FOR 
THE FUTURE.”

CITIES.

in the 100 Resilient Cities programme has helped to 
strengthen our growing reputation as a hub for clean 
tech and as a city taking action on climate change and 
has allowed us to cement important partnerships within 
the city and internationally. It has also supported us in 
helping to promote and export the skills and services of 
some of our local private sector partners (e.g. private 
sector companies such as Deltares, Arcadis and TNO are 
now active in Denmark, India and the US). 

Rotterdam has recently signed the 100 Resilient Cities 
10% pledge; committing 10% of the municipality annual 
budget towards spending on resilience projects and 
initiatives. This commitment means we are eligible for up 
to $5 million (additional) in platform resources through 
our association with 100 Resilient Cities. We will draw on 
this support to support implementation of strategy. 

100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the Rockefeller 
Foundation is dedicated to helping cities around the 
world become more resilient to the physical, social and 
economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st 
century. 100 Resilient Cities supports the adoption and 
incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just 
the shocks (i.e. earthquakes, fires, floods) but also the 
stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day 
or cyclical basis. www.100resilientcities.org.

The programme was established in honour of 
Rockefeller’s 100th anniversary; it will ultimately involve 
100 cities globally and had initial funding of $100 
million although the level of funding support has grown 
since the programme was launched.

Rotterdam, like other cities in the network, has received 
support from 100 Resilient Cities in a range or ways, as 
follows; 

•  Financial and logistical support to the position of a 

Chief Resilience Officer (CRO)

•  Expertise in guiding the process to develop a robust 
resilience strategy – Rotterdam has benefitted from 
input from AECOM as a 100 Resilient Cities strategy 
partner, as well as advice and guidance from 100 
Resilient Cities staff and other network cities

•  Access to solutions, service providers and public 
and private partners and NGOs – Rotterdam has 
had additional support from Microsoft, TNO and 
Drift

•  Membership of a network of world cities for 

knowledge exchange and learning – as an example 
Rotterdam hosted a successful network exchange in 
2015 attended by around twenty other CRO’s.

We are proud to have been one of the front running 
cities in the 100 Resilient Cities network and are pleased 
with the interactions we’ve already experienced through 
the network. Already it has been a catalyst for our 
participation in new resilience projects and has helped 
to enhance our city brand and identity. Our participation

MORE THAN 
ROBUSTNESS.

The 100 Resilient Cities programme defines urban 
resilience as: “The capacity of individuals, communities, 
institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to 
survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic 
stresses and acute shocks they experience”. 
In developing our resilience strategy we drew heavily 
on the 100 Resilient Cities established methodology 

and supporting tools. The City Resilience Framework 
(CRF) helped us to identify the relevant domains of city 
resilience. Our stage 2 diagnostic tasks helped us to 
identify the key shocks and stresses (and transitions) that 
Rotterdam may face in the future and the resilience and 
reality lenses, together with the seven resilience qualities 
helped us to develop and refine our action list.

An assessment of the current situation, using the overview of the 
12 most important aspects of the city as a system, as shown in the 
City Resilience Framework wheel (fig A). A first rough inventory of 
actions and programs contributing to these aspects showed us the 
richness of initiatives in Rotterdam contributing to resilience (fig B). 
Yet, this does not match the professional’s perception on the state 
of resilience (fig C.)

WHAT IS RESILIENCE.

ROTTERDAM: 
‘SELFIES’

ROTTERDAM TOMORROW 
We must also have a vision for Rotterdam in the future, for 
a resilient city. This needs to be understood by a range 
of stakeholders. Our visions and goals – set out later in 
this document – begin to paint a picture for a Resilient 
Rotterdam. Our identified projects and initiatives support 
and build on this picture. The selfie we envisage for 2030!

We were clear from the beginning that our resilience 
strategy should both reflect on the past and establish 
a vision for the future that is relevant across a range of 
spatial scales – local, district and citywide. We have taken 
three ‘selfies’ of the city to support this. 

ROTTERDAM THEN
From humble beginnings as a small fishing village we 
have developed into a 21st Century World Port City. We 
have overcome all types of crises and change having 
experienced flooding, wars and welcoming our many 
new residents from all over the world – we are now a city 
with 170 nationalities. We’ve learned by reflecting on 
our past that our people can pull together to overcome 
challenges by creating and planning robust systems and 
organizations, and that we have a generally inclusive 
society.

ROTTERDAM NOW
We are now at a moment in time where we have come 
together to consider – in a holistic way – some of the 
challenges and transitions we will face in the future and 
to agree between ourselves on a suite of actions that can 
enhance our city resilience going forward. We foresee a 
number of transitions on the horizon, these include: 

•  A changing economy driven more by sharing and 

technological innovation (“Next Economy”),

•  A different climate resulting from predicted climate 

change 

•  Changes in society and democracy driven by a 
move away from top–down hierarchy, to a more 
bottom up approach with much greater levels of 
community and citizen involvement.  

We recognise that we don’t know everything – there will 
be other unknown transitions and we have to be prepared 
for these.

WHAT IS RESILIENCE.

OUR RESILIENCE 
CHALLENGES.

We believe we have a strong track record on resilience, 
but we want to build on this platform and take our city 
resilience to the next level. Our challenge is to respond 
to a number of transitions happening in parallel that are 
potentially disruptive if not dealt with properly and to 
work hard to realize policies and actions that provide 
benefits in each – or many – of these areas. 
Using the 100 Resilient Cities methodology we defined 
six focus areas which represent our main resilience 
challenges. These are:
1. Social cohesion and education
2. Energy transition
3. Climate adaptation
4. Cyber use and security
5. Critical infrastructure
6. Changing urban governance

Based on our discoveries when focusing on these 
challenge areas we were able to develop a vision for 
a resilient Rotterdam together with a range of actions 
and initiatives aimed at specifically responding to the 
challenges identified. Our actions or initiatives are 
often cross cutting and address a number or all of the 
challenge areas. 

“MOVING FROM 
ROBUST TO 
RESILIENT.”

VISION.

IN 2030 ROTTERDAM 
WILL BE A CITY WHERE: 

•  strong citizens respect each other and are 

continuously developing themselves 

•  the energy infrastructure provides for an effi cient 

and sustainable energy supply in port and city

•  climate adaptation has penetrated into mainstream 

of city operations and water has added value for the 
city and our watermanagement system is cyberproof 
•  the underground is being used in such a way that it 

supports the growth and development of the city 
•  we have embraced digitization without making us 
dependant, and we have ensured a best practice 
level of cyber security

•  self organization in the city gets enough room and a 

fl exible local government supports if really needed 

•  resilience is part of our daily thinking and acting.

24 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY 

25

VISION.

ROTTERDAM 
RESILIENT CITY.

Rotterdam will work to embed resilience thinking into all 
of our city planning and delivery functions. We want to 
build on our heritage and past successes to take our city 
resilience to the next level. Robust is no longer enough, 
we want to become more flexible and engage community 
groups and other partners to work together to explore the 
synergies between our areas of work and to deliver co–
benefits. We want the whole city to join in!

Rotterdam is thriving again. After dominating lists of poor 
performance for long time, progress is being made. We 

are now celebrating the city centre, 75 years after it was 
destroyed in World War II. Safety has improved and 
Rotterdammers are amongst the happiest people in the 
Netherlands. The successful organisation of our country 
and city has brought us relative prosperity and a pleasant 
and safe place to live. 

Our strength is built on robustness, planning and control, 
but we foresee a number of new transitions and challenges 
and will have to stay alert and be prepared to build 
capacity to adapt to these changes.

The 21st century will see significant city growth for 
Rotterdam. We have a track record of dealing with 
challenges, and have proven on numerous occasions that 
we can overcome crisis and profit from new opportunities 
offered by adapting to a changing environment and 
context. Often these challenges have served to make us 
more robust and efficient. We are certain that in the future 
we will also need to become more flexible – seeking 
greater participation from citizens and stakeholders. 
By working together, we can harness the energy that 
exists in our society to let ideas grow, giving space 

“TYPICAL FOR 
ROTTERDAM:  
MAKE IT HAPPEN!”

and facilitating connection between people and the 
establishment of resilience networks.
 
In order to realize the vision we have established 7 
resilience goals: 
1. Rotterdam: a balanced society
2. World Port City built on clean and reliable energy
3. Rotterdam Cyber Port City
4. Climate Adaptive city to a new level
5. Infrastructure ready for the 21st century
6. Rotterdam network – Truly our city
7. Anchoring resilience in the city

Each goal is accompanied by fly wheel actions and 
additional actions. Fly wheel actions are our bigger actions 
which will make big leaps towards Rotterdam reaching a 
citywide state of resilience, while the additional actions 
contribute with lesser impact. Our resilience thinking has 
resulted in the identification of many new actions, as 
well as where appropriate, framing ongoing projects or 
initiatives to deliver a resilience dividend. 

26

ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY 

27

VISION.

THE STORY  
OF THE CITY.

The resilience strategy is not meant as a blueprint or end 
product, but as a starting point to show:

•  which activities, projects and programs already 

contribute to resilience;

•  how we can connect and enhance the existing 

instruments and initiatives;

•  how new activities can enhance city resilience.

Resilience thinking is being incorporated in the 
policymaking and initiatives across all domains of city 
government, including across social, physical and 
economic programmes. These elements come together in 
“The Story of the City”. The resilience strategy and “The 
Story of the City” are complementary. The latter sets out 
the kind of city we want Rotterdam to be, the Resilience 
Strategy shows how we can achieve this in a resilient way.

RESILIENCE COMPASS

RESILIENT
PEPERCLIP

We have developed our own Resilience Compass, 
intended as a point of reference to help us to frame 
our actions and to guide the transition from a robust 
present towards a resilient future. Moving from a robust 
Rotterdam our actions need to respond to one or more 
resilience themes (see City Resilience Framework), they 
must deliver a resilience dividend, set a clear goal and 
involve key stakeholders, including potential partners, 
funders and agencies. Our strategy articulates flywheel 
actions (i.e. the headline actions) and additional 
supporting actions. Some of the resilience actions seek 
to build on and enhance existing projects and initiatives, 
others are new.

30 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY 

31

RESILIENCE GOALS.

GOAL 1:
ROTTERDAM: A BALANCED SOCIETY

WE–SOCIETY
Global and local trends or sudden events can 
“unbalance” the Rotterdam society. For example the 
growth of migration which causes a greater diversity 
of norms and values. Also the crises beyond the 
Netherlands and Europe (wars and terrorist attacks) are 
of concern for the people of Rotterdam, with the attacks 
in Paris and Brussels still fresh in our minds we are 
endeavouring to prevent these tensions from disrupting 
our lives and the city. Recently all national and regional 
response and action planning has been reviewed and 
updated. It is crucial that the city invests in monitoring 
tensions in society and in social cohesion and resilience. 
The program WE–Society builds openness and mutual 
understanding (nothing to be unspoken) between people 
and is essential for maintaining the connections between 
different groups of people in Rotterdam. We will support 
and work to enhance and develop this programme to 
deliver positive resilience outcomes.

STRONG SHOULDERS
The program Strong Shoulders, reinforced by measures 
from the Woonvisie (vision for housing and living), is 
working to support a balanced population demographic 
in Rotterdam and specifically to attract highly educated 
people to the city. The resilience programme will support 
this initiative.

“Skilled and healthy 
citizens in a balanced 
society”

We seek to build and strengthen resilience at 
the individual and the societal level. Knowledge, 
skills, education, health and wellbeing and mutual 
understanding and respect are central pillars of a 
balanced society. We will support and enhance a 
number of ongoing processes and initiatives to support 
the resilience of Rotterdam’s citizens and society working 
alongside the existing Social Perspectives program 
(Foresight Social).

21ST CENTURY SKILLS
At the individual level, we need to provide learning 
skills and suitable education for life and work in the 21st 
century, including leadership skills. We want our young 
people to be ready to work in the ‘Next Economy’, to 
contribute and benefit from the digital revolution and to 
take ownership of their own future and responsibility for 
fellow citizens and their communities

HEALTH
We will focus on the health of the individual citizen, 
implementing a suite of tools and actions focused on 
specific groups and problems. Before summer 2016 
we will launch our policy document focused on Public 
Health.

GOAL 2:
WORLD PORT CITY BUILT ON CLEAN AND 
RELIABLE ENERGY

“Towards a flexible 
energy infrastructure  
for an efficient and 
sustainable energy  
mix in Port and City.”

Rotterdam wants to be the front runner in the clean 
energy transition and support recent political agreements 
through COP21 in Paris. The appetite for and evolution 
of sustainable energy technologies will have a great 
influence on the city and the port of Rotterdam. We are 
striving for a diversification of energy sources and to 
make the urban energy infrastructure more flexible, in 
order to successfully deliver this clean energy. Delivering 
this transition is a large and complex task, but it provides 
the opportunity for Rotterdam to strengthen its economy 
and reputation. The current and planned activities of the

port of Rotterdam (Bioport), the roadmap Next Economy 
for ‘a zero carbon’ future (Smart Energy Delta) and 
the measures of the Rotterdam’s sustainability program 
focused on renewable energy and energy conservation 
support this agenda. New actions are underway to 
underline the urgency of this transition. The Rotterdam 
energy infrastructure plan will give direction to the 
strategy for energy diversification at a district level, each 
with a roadmap for implementation. The port–industrial 
cluster will make and carry out an action plan in a joint 
effort with industries, government and the Rotterdam Port 
Authority. The Rotterdam sustainability program will be 
reinforced with new actions as follow up from COP21.

RESILIENCE GOALS.

GOAL 3:
ROTTERDAM CYBER PORT CITY

“Rotterdam aims to be 
a cyber resilient city and 
port; an important 
condition required to 
attract new business 
and investment”

The digitization of society offers many opportunities (Digital 
Gateway Rotterdam, Smart City), but risks of disruption of 
essential processes for production, logistics and services 
also increase. While the investments in Cyber increase at 
a rate of 27% per year, the investments in cyber security 
only increase at a rate of 4 %.The necessity of a cyber 
resilient port of Rotterdam was recognized by the Mayor, 
chief prosecutor and Chief of Police in 2014. Together with 
the Rotterdam Port Authority and Daltalinqs (representing 
700 companies) they have ordered a strategy on cyber 
resilience. Individual companies and organizations can 
have their own security in order, but they are also dependent 
on other companies, organizations and government 
services. The resilience of Rotterdam to cyber threats will be 
increased by enhancing awareness, sharing knowledge and 
experience and joining forces to improve responsiveness 
and ICT products. Both the port and city are taking cyber 
security seriously, they share experiences and have worked 
with Microsoft to develop comparable strategies and actions 
comprising 15 building blocks including a Cyber Resilience 
Platform, Cyber Resilience Desk, Cyber Resilience Co–op 
and a Port Cyber Resilience Officer. Rotterdam needs 
a Delta plan for Cyber Resilience. Rotterdam will have 
implemented its cyber resilience strategy within 5 years and 
will have significantly enhanced its cyber resilience.

GOAL 4:
CLIMATE ADAPTIVE ROTTERDAM 
TO A NEW LEVEL

“Climate proof 
plus cyber proof 
critical infrastructure”

The approach and practice established in Rotterdam’s 
climate adaptation strategy (2013) serves as an example 
to many other cities in the world. Implemented projects 
such as Water Sensitive Rotterdam – the construction of 
small and larger water storage combined with greening 
often initiated by citizens – is contributing to the resilience 
of Rotterdam. We need to build on this, to scale up 
the benefits. Clever water management approaches 
can deliver financial benefits. We will work to better 
understand cascading impacts and to factor these in to 
our cost benefit decision making (e.g. prolonged power 
outage or cyber threat). We will also strengthen our crisis 
management approaches based on increased knowledge 
of flood risks. Based on research conducted by TNO we 
have agreed that we must enhance our climate resilience 
strategy by taking action on cyber resilience. All 
stakeholders must start collaborating on this agenda that 
can help us to further climate proof the city. 

38 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY 

39

RESILIENCE GOALS.

GOAL 5:
INFRASTRUCTURE READY FOR 
THE 21ST CENTURY

“A robust and resilient 
underground infrastruc-
ture as a physical basis 
for a resilient Rotter-
dam”

Much of Rotterdam’s underground infrastructure is 
crucial for the city to function. Today, our underground 
infrastructure is robust but lacks flexibility to respond to 
emergencies, new technological developments and over 
ground development growth is limited. This brings some 
risks related to repair capacity, delivery of sub–optimal 
solutions and poor integration of above and below 
ground services. We want to increase resilience by 

enhancing the awareness of risk, developing a policy for 
more robust decision making; more integrated planning 
practice both underground and over ground, relating to 
infrastructural interventions.

This requires a reinforcement of cooperation among all 
infrastructure managers, including the city as a platform 
to share plans and (often confidential) knowledge 

and information. We are going to create more 
specific databases and information on the location of 
infrastructure and functions and interdependencies of the 
subsurface. We will also explore how innovative SMART 
technology can be integrated into the “Street of the 
Future”. Our resilience strategy commits to action in each 
of these areas.

40 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY 

41

RESILIENCE GOALS.

GOAL 6:
ROTTERDAM NETWORKCITY

“Residents, public and 
private organizations, 
businesses and 
knowledge institutions 
together determine the 
resilience of the city”

Our society is well organized. The city is being created 
by the Rotterdammers, therefore it is ‘truly our city. 
The local government is one amongst many other 
stakeholders. How do we manage to become resilient? 
The way the Rotterdam society operates has many 
characteristics of resilience including self–organization, 
strong networks and various coalitions of citizens and 
businesses and a government offering customised 
services and a facilitating role with programs like the 
Right to Challenge and CityLab010. 

Our resilience increases as more alternative organisations 
arise, but more effort is needed to incorporate resilience 
thinking into the DNA of the government and to use 
and strengthen the energy of Rotterdam’s society. The 
resilience strategy will focus on increasing government 
flexibility and will facilitate connecting several networks 
of locals, individuals and businesses, as a catalyst for 
more bottom–up community and business initiatives, to 
share knowledge and experiences to the advantage 
of Rotterdam’s people and businesses. Our future 

government will handle new ideas better and work 
to harness and augment the energy that derives from 
our communities and will accept more redundancy 
providing more alternatives during outing of services 
and operations. We have committed to actions including 
developing the cities desk for new democracy and 
participation and providing support to existing networks, 
citywide and at district level because they directly 
contribute to the resilience of our city’s governance.

GOAL 7:
ANCHORING RESILIENCE 
IN THE CITY 

“With stakeholders in the 
neighbourhoods, sharing 
knowledge and a facilitating 
organization”

We will develop an innovation and integration agenda 
on the back of this resilience strategy. We want to 
identify co–benefits and synergies. For example, 
strengthening the cyber resilience in Rotterdam 
strengthens the security of critical infrastructure. Working 
on 21st century skills of Rotterdam, including ICT skills, 

contributes to the cyber resilience. We think these 
synergies are very important to our strategy and will seek 
to explore these further. One way we will do this is within 
district pilot areas. A number of actions and themes 
can come together physically at the neighbourhood or 
building level.

Our resilience strategy names three pilot districts. These 
are Feijenoord, Delfshaven and the City Centre. We have 
initiatives that relate to a number of different scales, as 
follows:
1. Building (example: Resilient Peperklip)
2. Neighbourhood (example: Resilient Delfshaven)
3.  City (example: Nationaal Programma Rotterdam 

Zuid)

4.  Metropolitan Area (example: Roadmap Next

5.  National (example: Citydeal Climate Adaptation)
6. European (example: resilient Europe, URBACT)
7. Worldwide (example: 100 Resilient Cities)

Innovation will also be encouraged through 
comprehensive integrated research with public and 
private stakeholders at different scales. This includes 
knowledge development and knowledge exchange 
between 100 Resilient Cities cities, like the Rotterdam 
hosted exchange in October 2015. In the short term we 
will use the International Architecture Biennale (2018 and 
2020) and The International Advisory Board (2017) to 
address resilience as their main topics.

MOVING TO IMPLEMENTATION

“OUR AMBITION  
IS TO ANCHOR 
RESILIENCE THINKING 
IN THE CITY.”

It is recognised that delivering the Rotterdam resilience 
strategy will need to be a collaborative effort between 
the City of Rotterdam, businesses, citizens and other 
organizations, but that the city government has a key 
role to facilitate and initiate projects, and to provide 
leadership and the necessary strategic framework. 
The development of the Rotterdam Resilience Strategy 
has benefitted greatly from the executive sponsorship 
of Mayor Aboutaleb and the city has made a top level 
commitment to continue work to implement its resilience 
strategy in an integrated way up to 2020 at least.  

This document has been released for consultation. 
The process and organizational structure to realize 
the resilience strategy will be further defined based. 
Feedback will be organized by using, for example,  
an e-panel, a jury of citizens and district commissions. 
Following consultation further links will be made to 
connect the resilience strategy into the broader Story 
of the City. This strategy document is accompanied by 
a website. More detailed information can be found on

HIERARCHY

TO IMPROVE AND SECURE OUR CITY’S RESILIENCE WE 
WANT ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO CONSIDER THE RESILIENCE 
PERSPECTIVE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES – IN THEIR THOUGHTS 
AND ACTIONS. THE ACTIONS PROMOTED THROUGH 
THIS STRATEGY – COMPRISING 5 WHICH ARE ONGOING, 
19 THAT ARE JUST BEGINNING AND 44 THAT ARE 
COMPLETELY NEW – SHOW SOME OF THE WAYS THAT 
ROTTERDAM CAN IMPROVE  ITS RESILIENCE. OUR CHIEF 
RESILIENCE OFFICER SUPPORTS AND PROMOTES THESE 
ACTIONS.

Our action plan includes 5 ongoing, 44 new, and 19 
starting initiatives and actions. The ongoing initiatives, 
like Roadmap Next Economy, Water Sensitive Rotterdam 
and the program WE–Society, are included because 
they are identified as essential for a resilient Rotterdam. 
Where necessary these initiatives will be enhanced and 
developed with resilience thinking and linked to the 
resilience strategy to deliver positive resilience outcomes, 
to accelerate upscaling and to allow for lessons learnt and 
wider dissemination through the resilience office. 

There are some new actions that are already in start–up 
phase, partly due to the Resilience program, which will 
be supported where necessary by the resilience office 
and other new actions that will serve as examples of how 
resilience thinking and interventions can be applied at a 
practical level at the scale of the neighbourhood, street 
and building. It is expected that further new initiatives will 

arise, to enhance the resilience of Rotterdam. The resilience 
office will focus on connecting, enriching and accelerating 
these where they are feasible, viable and deliver clear 
resilience dividends. 

Our actions are distinguished into two types: flywheel 
actions and additional actions. The flywheel actions are the 
headline actions that deliver the greatest resilience benefit 
for Rotterdam or which serve as an umbrella for a cluster of 
supporting actions. The supporting actions are considered 
to have less impact individually. We have included a key 
to help navigation through the actions, letters (i.e. A, B, C) 
signpost the flywheel actions where numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3) 
are used for the supporting actions. Synergies and overlaps 
are shown under ‘related actions’ and icons are used to 
relate the actions back the resilience challenge areas, to 
highlight the resilience qualities within the specified action 
and to show the scale at which the action is applicable.

RESILIENCE LAB: ACTIONS.

GOAL 1:
ROTTERDAM: A BALANCED SOCIETY

A

A PROGRAM FOR 21ST 
CENTURY SKILLS AND 
YOUNG LEADERSHIP

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EDUCATION PROGRAM ON (DIGITAL) SKILLS 
AND PERSONAL LEADERSHIP FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

We will develop a program for 21st century skills to teach young people the skills they need in a rapidly 
changing society. The transitions we foresee will impact on the societal skills required of an individual; 
placing more emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, personal leadership and IT skills. There are a 
number of supporting actions that underpin this programme. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

Development of 21st century skills can enhance 
personal resilience and support our goal to create a 
more balanced society. It supports flexibility, creativity 
and individual learning empowering people to take 
responsibility for their own future and to play a part in 
their local community. Training and skills development 
through this programme will also support our goals 
related to increased cyber security and new modes of 
governance. Digitally literate citizens can contribute 
to the cyber resilient city and personal leadership 
is important as the government retreats and the 
importance of participation in community networks 
grows.

BUILDING ON THE PUBLIC 
HEALTH ACT 2016–2019 

 

Rotterdam is drafting the Public Health Act 2016–2019 in order to make its public health goals more 
concrete. The Act redefines health not as the absence of disease but as the state of resilience and 
being able to shape your own life no matter what happens. The Act is an inspirational guide which 
aims to promote Rotterdam’s ambition to connect inhabitants and important stakeholders focussing on 
public health. The Act touches on actions that can be taken by Rotterdammers, as well as by community 
groups working in neighbourhoods and by government and healthcare and welfare institutions. The 
Act will be discussed and enriched through a number of productive dialogue sessions, many of which 
will touch on important aspects of resilience. The municipality will work to build on this dialogue and 
support key actions arising which contribute to city resilience. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

Public health dialogue sessions and resulting actions 
can directly contribute to many of the city resilience 
goals. The sessions bring people together to discuss 
ideas and issues, share best practice and to seed 
projects that can contribute to a more healthy and 
balanced society. The resilience office will support this 
ongoing initiative.

SKILLS FOR THE NEXT ECONOMY – 
THE POWER OF THE 100 RESILIENT 
CITIES NETWORK

Understanding the skills needed to fuel the 
economy of the future and ensuring that 
residents have access to training opportunities 
to develop those skills is essential to building 
Rotterdam’s resilience. This is not a challenge 
that is unique to Rotterdam. As many cities in 
the 100 Resilient Cities network face similar 
priorities, a number of Chief Resilience Officers 
have kicked off a Learning Community to 
exchange knowledge and resources around 
post-industrial economies, including innovative 
education and training programs to build the 
skills of the 21st century.

5 ‘NUDGING’ HEALTHY BEHAVIOUR

Our city has already begun research and creating an agenda to identify what motivates goal groups 
to make behavioural changes to have a healthier lifestyle. We will develop and help disseminate this 
research to nudge our citizens (and organizations) towards healthier lifestyles, working in collaboration 
with the Erasmus University Medical Centre. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

•  Embeds the notions of healthy 

behaviour and the required 
behavioural changes across society, 
targeted at specific audiences/target 
groups

•  Supports the self-sufficiency and 

resilience of citizens (and indirectly 
organisations and the economy)

•  Understanding behaviour and the 

mechanisms that can drive behavioural 
change can drive efficiencies and 
cost saving in delivering numerous 
programmes/initiatives together. This 
understanding will support delivery of 
initiatives that can deliver co-benefits 
(e.g. disseminating information on 
safe driving that also delivered fuel 
efficiency benefit)

PROGRAM:  
WE–SOCIETY
The program WE–Society is a citywide program which aims to support the current connections 
between population groups, facilitate further connections, promote dialogue and to stand up for one 
another. The programme includes a number of activities and forums that support these aims and will 
work with both new and existing groups and networks. It is the intention that the Mayor will share all 
dialogue and meeting records through the G1000 Citizens’ Summit in 2017. The resilience programme 
will support the aims and activities of the WE–society programme and will look for opportunities to 
connect groups with wider city initiatives and to upscale the resilience benefits. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

The WE–Society program is explicitly designed to 
increase the resiliency of society by joining citizens 
together to discuss and share common challenges 
and solutions and create a better understanding of 
cultural differences. It can directly contribute to our 
resilience goals ‘vital citizens in a balanced society’ 
and ‘network city Rotterdam: truly our city.’ The 
program strengthens existing networks in the city and 
contributes to the emergence of new community level 
networks.

9 100 HOMES FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS

The Foundation Verre Bergen has purchased 100 homes for families seeking asylum in Rotterdam. This 
forms part of their New Home Rotterdam program’s ambition to teach asylum seekers Dutch, assist 
them to find employment and education and to feel comfortable in their homes and neighbourhoods. 
This action will be supported and will be connected to wider efforts because it is an excellent example 
of an initiative contributing to the resilience of Rotterdam. Housing for refugees – and migration more 
broadly – is an important urban resilience challenge. A number of CRO’s within the 100 Resilient Cities 
network have started a conversation on migration which may lead to a formal exchange. 100 Resilient 
Cities member cities actively involved in this conversation include: Montreal, Athens, NYC, Thessaloniki, 
Vejle, Paris, Amman, Ramallah and Byblos. Rotterdam will consider whether we can contribute to this 
exchange in the future.

RESILIENCE VALUE 

•  Supports and promotes an integrated 

and inclusive society.

STRONG SHOULDERS 
PROGRAM

The City of Rotterdam is aiming to increase the proportion of highly educated residents in the city in 
the coming years. Part of making this happen is in understanding the needs of this group of people to 
stay in Rotterdam or to migrate to Rotterdam. The program ‘Strong Shoulders Strong City’ develops 
and promotes activities aimed at achieving this goal, and takes energy from a group of successful 
entrepreneurial Rotterdammers. The program consists of four action lines:

•  Inventory of good practices: what makes this group of citizens want to live in Rotterdam?
•  Removal of existing barriers.
•  Development of new projects following the needs and initiatives from the community.
•  Communication and promotional activities. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

The citywide program Strong Shoulders – Strong City 
contributes directly to the resilience objective ‘vital 
citizens in a balanced society’. More highly educated 
people will strengthen existing networks and the 
resilience of the local community and economy. It also 
strengthens the resilience goal Network City since 
this group of people strengthen the potential for self–
organization of the community.

10 VISION ON HOUSING (WOONVISIE)

The Woonvisie is Rotterdam’s vision to become an attractive residential city. It promotes attractive living 
environments, and housing that is future proof. Woonvisie creates a balance in housing for different groups 
of residents, improving housing quality. As such it has some cross over with the WE–society programme. 
The Woonvisie is the basis for agreements with all housing corporations and offers a framework for city 
developers and for the policymakers for the housing of specific goal groups. 

RESILIENCE VALUE 

•  The Woonvisie is an important 
instrument to provide adequate 
housing for different groups in the city 
supporting the goals of a balanced 
society and creates inclusiveness. 

•  Supports Rotterdam’s brand and ‘pull’ 

as an attractive cosmopolitan city.

11 PROMOTING CITIZEN COLLABORATION

Within the Strong Shoulders program – supported by field work and surveys – work has been undertaken to 
consider how high and low–skilled Rotterdammers could work together in effective and harmonious ways. 
As a result of this work a range of approaches (‘how to’ guides) were developed. Some of the solutions are 
straight forward and simple whilst others require an intensive effort to seed more effective collaboration. This 
agenda needs to be developed and experiences learnt from other cities around the world, and specifically 
from with the 100 Resilient Cities network. 

RESILIENCE VALUE 

•  Contributes to a better understanding 

of conditions that enhance social 
cohesion and therefore supports a 
balanced society and inclusiveness. 

•  Having different groups living in 

one neighbourhood enhances 
resourcefulness with more viewpoints

GOAL 2:
WORLD PORT CITY BUILT ON CLEAN 
AND RELIABLE ENERGY

ACHIEVING OUR ENERGY TRANSITION – 
INSPIRATION FROM LONDON 

Rotterdam wants to be the front runner in the 
clean energy transition and support recent 
political agreements through COP21 in Paris. 
Rotterdam looks to London for knowledge 
sharing in this area; the two cities are already 
partners in the EU CELSIUS Smart Cities project. 
Rotterdam hopes to engage further in this topic 
through the 100 Resilient Cities network.
As an existing partner city for the CELSIUS 
project (comprising London, Rotterdam, 
Gothenburg, Cologne, Genoa), there are 

66 ROTTERDAM RESILIENCE STRATEGY

obvious synergies between the two cities in 
terms of focus on district heating infrastructure 
and also in their wider climate change 
agendas and targets. Both cities need to use 
their respective planning policies to promote 
renewable energy uptake and to support the 
roll out of infrastructure that can support a low 
carbon energy transition, whilst also investing 
in improving energy efficiency in their existing 
buildings. 

100 Resilient Cities member cities involved: 
Rotterdam, London.

E
ROTTERDAM ENERGY 
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN

A transition to efficient and renewable energy requires – in addition to building–related efficiency 
measures – a supporting and flexible infrastructure. Moving this from ambition to reality is challenging 
and will require a clear roadmap (or strategy). This roadmap will outline options, costs and benefits 
and set out a preferred strategy. It will consider technology innovation, phasing, emissions and 
infrastructure flexibility. This action will support the development of a clean energy road map. It will 
outline what is possible in terms of a future clean energy mix, (considering waste heat (e.g. heat 
roundabout), developments in the port area and renewable energy potential from wind and solar), 
set out infrastructure implications relating to phasing, potential disruptions, cost and flexibility and 
address any issues around approvals, regulations, partnerships and funding. This is a flagship action 
for Rotterdam and we will collaborate on this with other cities in the 100 Resilient Cities network such 
as London and New York. We have existing energy related collaborations with London through the 
CELCIUS project. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

The renewable energy infrastructure plan (REIP) will set 
out a roadmap for how Rotterdam can deliver on its 
clean energy transition. This will reduce our emissions, 
improve our energy security and ensure we are future 
proof. It is also a key area of resilience where we will 
collaborate with the Port authority and a range of 
other utility stakeholders and technology providers. 

Rotterdam wants to be the front runner in the clean

REINFORCING ROTTERDAM  
MOERDIJK INDUSTRY CLUSTER

The Rotterdam / Moerdijk chemical cluster is different from other Dutch chemical clusters because of 
its strong integration with the oil refining sector, utilities and energy suppliers. An action plan will be 
developed together with the private sector with the aim to reinforce the Rotterdam / Moerdijk industry 
cluster. The action plan will contain concrete and specific measures to ensure companies stay within the 
cluster, and to further reinforce collaboration and initiatives within the cluster. The cluster is expected to 
play an important role in the transition from a linear, fossil economy to a circular, bio–based economy 
(see Action ‘A transition from a fossil fuel to a bio–energy for our Port’).

RESILIENCE VALUE

The industrial port cluster is of fundamental economic 
importance for Rotterdam and the Netherlands. The 
survival of the industrial cluster is vital for the city port 
region and the Netherlands. This initiative also delivers 
benefits in terms of the clean energy transition and 
next economy, including 21st century skills. The action 
plan must safeguard the leading position of this cluster 
in Europe.

PARIS PLUS (SUSTAINABILITY 
PROGRAM)

In order to support the Government’s COP21climate commitments Rotterdam is required to implement 
additional emissions saving measures. These include simple, cost–effective provision and installation 
of solar panels as well as the development of large solar parks, and switching a large portion of the 
municipal vehicle fleet to more efficient vehicles. The Rotterdam Climate Initiative (RCI) is also working 
in the port to reduce energy consumption, through: reuse of industrial waste heat, renewable energy 
generation (using wind, solar and biomass), promoting the use of LNG and hydrogen, and the capture, 
transport, reuse and storage of CO2 (carbon capture and storage). In rolling out these actions we will 
integrate resilience thinking to ensure the actions and activities contribute to the city resilience goals set 
out in this strategy document.

RESILIENCE VALUE

By building on the momentum and government support 
through the climate agreement developed following 
COP21, this programme of measures will seek to 
accelerate the energy transition in Rotterdam. It can 
also provide a platform to integrate resilience thinking 
into initiatives that already have political support.

PORT TRANSITION FOCUSED ON 
BIO–BASED ECONOMY 

The Port Authority along with the Dutch Research Institute for Transitions (DRIFT) is working to establish 
a bio–based port forum. In addition to established parties in the port, a number of smaller frontrunner 
parties and external port observers will be included in this, including organizations from the industries 
of food, logistics and agriculture and recycling. This forum will give rise to a “transition agenda” for the 
future of the bio–based port. The transition agenda will set out: 

•  A vision and guiding principles for the bio–based harbour 
•  Goals and goals 
•  Practical steps / actions and initiatives to realise the vision 
•  Commitment by the key parties for immediate follow–up on the identified actions. 

The resilience office will support the development of this forum and supporting agenda and will work to 
ensure the plan and actions respond to Rotterdam’s resilience challenges.

RESILIENCE VALUE

Making a transition from a fossil fuel–based energy 
system to a bio–based economy in the Rotterdam will 
be a challenge, but will build resilience through by 
creating supply chain networks, reducing emissions 
and enhancing the area’s brand. A shift towards 
a sharing economy also supports agendas around 
the next economy, skills development and smart 
technology approaches. Taking a lead on this agenda 
should also give Rotterdam a competitive advantage 
and allow knowledge share with a number of other 
port or post–industrial cities. Rotterdam has explored 
collaboration potential with Glasgow and Bristol 
through the 100 Resilient Cities network. The forum will 
be inclusive of a wide range of stakeholders and will 
build relationships which could lead to collaboration in 
other areas, for example on the broader clean energy 
transition (wind and solar) or on climate adaptation.

WATER SENSITIVE 
ROTTERDAM (WSR)

EMBEDDING CLIMATE ADAPTATION INTO THE URBAN FABRIC OF THE CITY

This action will develop and enhance existing programmes aiming to prepare the city for the impacts of 
climate change. Measures included within this action are in line with projects already completed in 
Rotterdam such as Benthemplein, and will be designed to support community learning – specifically in 
respect of understanding the urgency of the need to take action on climate change. Measures will 
range in their type and scale but we envisage: 
•  A large number small projects that can be led by citizens and businesses under the motto “many 

small actions; make a big difference”

• A small selection of key projects specifically designed to inspire and create publicity and profile 
•  Effective large–scale projects that run quietly in the background to deepen understanding, support 

research and tools developed (e.g. rigorous cost / benefit analysis).

We specially want to seed a new way of thinking. To not see rain water as a problem or a threat but to 
recognise it as a valuable raw material that should be utilized as much as possible locally. We want to 
move further towards fully integrated water cycle management – integrating the water cycle into our 
urban environment including collection (attenuation), treatment and conveyance. We will seek to related 
our climate change projects to other resilience actions and to publicise the synergies. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

All climate change projects and initiatives will 
consider how they can contribute to the further 
development of a liveable city; promote social 
cohesion whilst also increasing Rotterdam’s 
resilience to water stresses and shocks. It 
especially appeals to inclusiveness; involving 
property owners to participate and integration 
to use and enrich ongoing developments with 
water management actions.

18 ZOHO: 1ST CLIMATE–PROOF DISTRICT

Zomerhofkwartier (Zoho) together with the support of users of the area (residents, businesses, organizations 
and visitors) has undergone a gradual urban regeneration. A neighbourhood which previously had a lot of 
empty commercial units has been transformed into a district where everything is possible, with 120 companies 
now operating in the area. The unique multifunctional Waterplein Benthemplein acted as a catalyst project for 
further development of Zoho. Climate adaptation was found to act as a driver for sustainable development 
and has strengthened social cohesion. The resilience office will collect experiences learnt in Zoho and scale 
them up to other districts and the surrounding areas. The district and wider region can therefore be used as 
an example for how to scale up green and creative solutions for water retention whilst also strengthening 
community relateds and building knowledge capital.

RESILIENCE VALUE

Using climate adaptation as the driver the 
Zoho project has successfully integrated 
urban design, landscape, arts and 
community projects to provide a catalyst 
for a whole scale regeneration of a district 
in Rotterdam. It is a fantastic example 
of how combining a suite of initiatives 
in a single area together with careful 
community and business consultation 
and engagement can deliver a range of 
beneficial outcomes. This district is now 
more resilient to flooding, more self-
sufficient and has a stronger and more 
connected community. The challenge now 
is to take the learning from Zoho and 
apply it in other districts in Rotterdam. This 
can help to disseminate resilience thinking, 
encourage participation and support 
learning.

CYBER PROOF WATER 
SYSTEM

FLOOD 2.0: DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR MAKING OUR 
WATERMANAGEMENT SYSTEM CYBER PROOF

A TNO study into the vulnerability of the wastewater and surface water systems in Rotterdam indicates 
that these systems are generally robust. Climate change and increasing digitalization and automation of 
the systems will test this, and will likely expose more cascading impacts and vulnerabilities, specifically 
to ICT disruptions. The TNO study was carried out from the resilience perspective, with particular 
consideration for ICT, security and emergency response. Operational specialists and policy–oriented 
professionals from both municipal and water authorities collaborated on the study. A quick scan of 
risks for critical functions of the water systems (undertaken for the study) highlighted a greater need for 
tactical awareness regarding the cyber risks of Industrial Control Systems. A deeper assessment and 
action plan will be developed responding to this risk. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

By increasing automation of the City’s water systems 
it is important to also consider the cyber risks of ICT 
systems as well as cascading impacts if there is a 
technology malfunction. Climate cyber resilience and 
critical infrastructure are closely relateded; we expect 
some learning from this action to support other actions 
relating to critical infrastructure asset management.

GAINING ADDED VALUE FROM FLOOD DEFENCES: FEIJENOORD

Feijenoord is considered to be an area vulnerable to flooding from the river and is also undergoing urban 
development. In order to balance these – at times – conflicting characteristics it is important to understand 
the level of flood risk, the implications of this and also the opportunities that may be presented to integrate 
flood management strategies into the urban design response.

Agreements between the developers and other parties which outline the distribution of costs and benefits to 
contribute to the design and development integrated and sustainable development of the district have 
initially gained support. This could involve the municipality and water board bearing the costs of the 
construction and management of a flood defence with private parties contributing a proportion to the 
investment costs in return for direct benefits in terms of reduced flood risk and improved socio–economic 
conditions within the district. In order to capitalize on these opportunities, it is necessary to work with all 
stakeholders in the flood–prone areas to develop a water safety plan in conjunction with the development 
masterplan. The resilience office will support this and help upscale lessons learned from this development.

RESILIENCE VALUE

There are opportunities to respond to risk (flooding) 
in an integrated and inclusive way as part of a 
development plan and vision. This can also be 
supported by an alternative funding model where 
investors can accrue benefit due to reduced flood risk, 
reduced insurance and higher development values. 
This approach can serve as a model for integrated 
climate resilient waterfront development elsewhere in 
the Netherlands and internationally.

21 CLIMATE RESILIENT WATERFRONT AREAS

In 2014 the National Delta Programme was established. In Rotterdam, as part of the Rotterdam Adaptation 
Strategy, there are a diverse range of pilot studies which focus on climate resilient development in the wider 
region; looking at both urban and industrial areas. Some include Pilot Noordereiland, Pilot Botlek, Pilot 
Feijenoord, Pilot Crisis management and flooding. The results of these pilots will be collated and translated into 
overall policy for the area outside the dykes in Rotterdam.

20 VERTICAL EVACUATION PLANNING

An important part of the National Delta Program is the concept of “multi–layer safety”. This involves prevention 
(1st layer) spatial adaptation (2nd layer) and evacuation (3rd layer). The evacuation layer has yet to be fully 
planned and developed. The pilot study “crisis management during floods” found that vertical evacuation 
needs proper consideration as a serious option for layer 3. Specifically, consideration should be given to 
the fact that the highest areas are located along the river, outside the dykes and the entire port area. We will 
develop a vertical evacuation plan as part of our resilience strategy implementation.

RESILIENCE VALUE

•  Supports preparedness and embeds 
considerations for evacuation into all 
aspects of the city and port.

22 ROTTERDAM–THE HAGUE EMERGENCY AIRPORT (RHEA)

The Rotterdam–The Hague Emergency Airport (RHEA) will create an economic cluster focussing on clean 
technology and water security in an airport setting. As a ‘safe haven’, the site can be an excellent example of 
water security in The Netherlands (demonstrating multi–layer security: 3rd Layer). We will establish a knowledge 
and training centre for service providers, business, research, NGOs and aid organisations that will tap into 
RHEA companies and scientists specialized in clean technology products in the region.

RESILIENCE VALUE

This centre will serve as a demonstrator for 
Rotterdam. It will achieve a critical mass of 
organisations and institutes that will be a 
catalyst for innovation and research. The 
cluster will support resilience goals around

TWINNING NEW ORLEANS AND ROTTERDAM – WATERMANAGEMENT
 
New Orleans (NOLA) and Rotterdam have been collaborating since 2008, specifically in relation to water 
management. After hurricane Katrina Dutch experts assisted NOLA by hosting the “Dutch Dialogues”. 
Learning from this dialogue contributed to the development of NOLA’s Integrated Water Management Plan. 
Now NOLA participates in the Connecting Delta Cities network and the two cities are further linked by 
their participation in the 100 Resilient Cities programme. The two cities have both benefitted from earlier 
knowledge sharing and are committed to more collaboration in the future. Future efforts will be directed 
towards climate resilience, social resilience and the development of business and knowledge.

COOPERATION 
BETWEEN INFRASTRUCTURE 
PROVIDERS

The subsurface is required for routing multiple infrastructure types and numerous agencies have 
an interest in how the subsurface is managed. The municipality plays an important role in this 
management, but there are multiple network providers which operate independently of each other. 
There is a need for greater organisation and cooperation, especially in times of emergency when 
a disruption to one type of critical infrastructure can have cascading impacts across infrastructure 
networks. There is a greater need to ensure that the providers coordinate approaches and share 
experiences and knowledge. This action seeks to incorporate resilience into the agenda at a strategic 
level as well as on to the existing platforms for infrastructure / utility providers. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

This action will facilitate dialogue between different 
network operators, allowing them to verify their 
resilience and eventually increase the resilience of the 
overall system of critical infrastructure. Communication 
regarding resilience at operational and strategic levels 
will strengthen and broaden relationships between 
stakeholders which will lead to benefits in our other 
resilience goal areas (e.g. energy transition).

THE SUBSURFACE 
ABOVE GROUND

DEVELOPING POLICY TO RAISE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBSURFACE IN 
PLANNING AND PROJECTS

Consideration and understanding of both above and below ground will allow the city to better realise 
its ambitions for densification, greening and water storage. Once spatial planning is comprehensive 
and inclusive, there is more room for flexibility and ingenuity. There is a need to better consider above 
and below ground development in an integrated manner as currently when making spatial plans for the 
city there is currently too little consideration given to the subsurface infrastructure. Developing policies 
goaled at the subsurface planning and management is an integral part of spatial development and 
allows for appropriate corridor protection and optimal space use. These policies will be developed as 
an action as part of the implementation of this resilience strategy.

RESILIENCE VALUE

A shared vision and policy for ‘underground 
in Rotterdam’ will raise awareness of risks and 
opportunities of the underground systems to both 
urban planners and infrastructure managers. It will 
support better planning and asset management and 
therefore help improve resilience.

26 COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF INFRASTRUCTURE DECISION MAKING

Generally, risk management and spatial planning do not consider the costs and benefits of development in 
the longer term (i.e. the full life cycle considerations), but this can support effective decision making and help 
make the case for investment in redundancy. This is particularly prevalent in the context of underground critical

MANAGEMENT FOR OUR UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE

The municipality of Rotterdam’s asset management team used to maintain and manage all assets in public 
spaces as well as manage a risk register. This included for items such as bridges and quay walls and also 
green spaces and lighting. Asset management not only considers the costs and current status of the assets 
themselves but also the potential risks that the failure of the assets could have on the functioning of the city. By 
mapping the risks, decisions can be made as to what measures should and should not be performed based 
on a balance of performance, risk and cost. Smart investments now can often deliver savings in the future. 
This action will develop protocols for the asset management of underground infrastructure, intended to support 
decision making in respect of maintenance and replacement.

STREET OF THE 
FUTURE
SUBSURFACE INVESTMENT PRIORITIES 
FOR THE STREET OF THE FUTURE

Rotterdam’s subsurface environment is getting overcrowded, in some areas this is a limitation on new 
development. There are a growing number of disruption incidents as a result of still insufficiently subsurface 
mapping and accidental excavation of critical infrastructure, and co–ordination and dialogue between the 
various utility companies needs to be improved. The city is improving our old degraded infrastructure (e.g. 
gas networks and around 40km of sewer per year) whilst at the same time investing in new infrastructure 
that is fit for the future, for example, to support a clean energy transition and the next economy (digital). 

As a result of the underground upgrades, investments now could deliver long term pay back though 
increased flexibility and redundancy to allow greater surface level building development. Ensure 
appropriate investment relies in part in having a future vision. This action will seek to conceive the street of 
the future. We imagine new multi–utility service corridors, improved subsurface 3D mapping, enhanced 
co–ordination and dialogue and thorough market and citizen engagement will help us to determine now 
what infrastructure investments are needed to ensure sufficient flexibility for the street of the future.

RESILIENCE VALUE

Engagement with utilities will help to better understand 
the infrastructure required to support key city 
transitions (e.g. energy and smart city). The physical 
works will ultimately facilitate development, grow the 
economy and ensure new infrastructure investments 
consider resilience. Secondary benefits will come from 
business and citizen engagement (i.e. participatory 
design process) and through enhancing knowledge 
around the impacts of climate change on the 
subsurface environment.

ACTIVE CITIZENS

FACILITATION AND EXPERIMENTING WITH SELF–ORGANIZATION OF CITIZENS

Rotterdam has already developed a suite of tools to respond to the needs and aspirations of its citizens. 
The city uses this suite of tools, such as small grants for Residents Initiatives, CityLab010 for innovative 
actions, Opzoomeren for street activities, the “Right to Challenge” and Citizens Jury, Referendum and 
Digital opinion research to engage and support community and private sector grass roots initiatives in 
the city. 

The city recognises that in order to further the engagement and mobilization of citizens there is a need 
for a shift from top–down city level and framework approaches to bottom–up interests and initiatives 
at the citizen and neighbourhood level. The municipality is continuously seeking to optimise the value 
gained from its processes and activities and understands that to derive most value from these tools it 
needs to improve its back offi ce processes around initiative selection, management and funding to 
provide a smoother interaction for the citizen. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

The ability for self–organization is a key element for a 
resilient city. This action will seek to build engagement 
at citizen and community level by enhancing the 
user experience associated with existing city funding 
and support initiatives. Providing greater incentive 
for citizens to come forward with solutions they can 
implement at local level can strengthen social cohesion 
and support a number of our resilience goals. It is

ROTTERDAM 
 
NETWORK CITY

CREATING NETWORKS OF GOVERNMENT, CITIZENS, INSTITUTIONS, 
MARKET AND KNOWLEDGE

There is a changing role for the government, instead of a central guiding policy role, the role is 
increasingly shifting to frameworks, facilitation and enabling. The community and the market have 
increasing ambition to tackle social issues and therefore also expect to get more space and support 
from the government to do so. It is important that the market, community and government facilitate 
each other and find an effective method for cooperation and collaboration. That is the basis for a 
resilient system of governance for Rotterdam. Make it happen: the motto for the city encompasses this. 
This action is intended to ensure that we become more aware, that we recognise the importance of 
networks and platforms for engagement and that we share our knowledge around key initiatives. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

This action contributes to building relationships 
between citizens, companies and institutions and can 
deliver benefits across most of the identified resilience 
goals.

28 WORLD EXPO 2025 

World Expo 2025 is an initiative led by a group of Rotterdam entrepreneurs. Their plan includes a ten–year 
economic program that culminates during the Exhibition in 2025. The Expo will last six months and attract 
an estimated twenty million visitors. Only the Dutch Government can put Rotterdam forward as a candidate 
for the Expo; a decision has yet to be taken on this. The municipality has approved the plan and agrees that 
the spatial integration contributes to the necessary infrastructure upgrades. Additionally, proposed is an ‘Expo 
Works’ authority, which is a special program aimed at creating jobs for young people in Rotterdam. The theme 
of the World Expo 2025 would be ‘Rotterdam Changing Currents’, with one of the subthemes titled ‘Deltas in 
Transition’.

NEIGHBOURHOOD 
ORIENTED GOVERNANCE

The city of Rotterdam is constantly looking for ways to connect urban interests and the interests of the 
individual citizen, streets and neighbourhoods. Rotterdam has 14 regions and 42 districts. 
The City of Rotterdam recently started working with the district controlled planning program.  
The aim is to enhance the organization and effectiveness of municipal district level activities, and to 
promote full involvement from citizens and government in planning and running these districts.
Financing and accounting systems will be adapted to allow for more decentralized governance in the 
future and special district officials are appointed to monitor what is happening in the neighbourhood 
and to align the service provision for the central municipal departments (clusters). 
The neighbourhood action plans are the results and activities at the district level.  
Citizens are closely involved and their satisfaction and engagement in the process are monitored.

RESILIENCE VALUE

Improving the function of the government by 
incorporating more flexibility, integration and 
inclusiveness to all the needs of the citizens to 
be better understood and addressed in a more 
decentralized approach.

Led by local entrepreneurs, an opportunity map was developed which identified a series of initiatives. 
In cooperation with the municipality a strategy for how these should be realized is being developed, 
with the aim to deliver a robust self–supporting network. The next steps have been established with this 
strategy acting as a test case for the creation of an effective and efficient network at the neighbourhood 
level. The aim is to facilitate this development process and to learn from it, allowing lessons to be learnt 
and taken forward to other areas across the city.

32 GOVERNANCE LAB EUR

The City of Rotterdam together with the Erasmus University will start a Governance Lab, a joint initiative 
to come through design research to strengthen the organizational capacity of the city. This initiative is 
organized in line with the Rotterdam Resilience Strategy and is intended for use by design and action 
research to implement the city’s vision of resilience. Many elements of the resilience strategy relate to the 
mobilization and utilization of a self–organizing, able society, and the market increasing the resilience 
of the city. A joint Governance Lab should make it possible to bring together the knowledge questions 
from Rotterdam and the research interests of the EUR and matching. It is important that the municipality 
combines knowledge questions and invests in the lab, especially as the university is looking towards 
current research programs in space, to capitalise on this knowledge. Ultimately, it comes to designing 
research: the translation of scientific theory and empirical research into useful concepts and designs for the 
practice of the city (via experimental, designing and action research).

RESILIENCE VALUE

A resilient system of governance is 
the foundation for a resilient city. The 
establishment of the resilient system of 
governance is situationally determined, 
and requires room for experimentation, 
improvisation and learning.

34 DEVELOPMENT OPEN DATA PLATFORM

Rotterdam has developed an online data log www.rotterdamopendata.nl. From this site it is possible for 
anyone to open datasets regardless of the content and conditionally use it. Through active sharing of 
data it is expected that there will be increased economic and innovation activities as well as new forms 
of cooperation to better develop the economy and Rotterdam as a smart city. The site also encourages 
greater participation and self–reliance. Although Rotterdam is among one of the frontrunners in Europe, 
the municipality still wants to further increase close cooperation between the government, citizens, 
businesses and knowledge institutions in the city and wider region, moving to a relationship whereby these 
parties can freely share ideas and datasets (open data). This action will ensure the ongoing development 
and dissemination of learning from the open data portal.

GOAL 7:
ANCHORING RESILIENCE  
IN THE CITY 

S
NATIONAL PROGRAM 
ROTTERDAM ZUID

Rotterdam South is different from the rest of Rotterdam and the other three major cities in The 
Netherlands. Unfortunately, the socio–economic conditions are often worse; the average educational 
level is lower, there is a higher unemployment rate, the quality of housing is worse and its inhabitants 
are less optimistic about the future of the district. On top of this, there is a higher percentage of 
households receiving unemployment benefit in the south (9% in The Netherlands compared to 19% 
in Rotterdam south). Within Rotterdam south there are 7 focus areas which scored worse still on key 
socio–economic indicators than average even for Rotterdam south. 

The National Programme Rotterdam South (NPRZ) aims to improve the lives of those living in Rotterdam 
South so that in 2030 it is doing at least as well as the rest of Rotterdam and the three other major 
cities in The Netherlands. NPRZ has three pillars: school, work and life. The NPRZ wants to ensure that 
people living in Rotterdam South reach a higher level of education, find more work, have improved 
housing, and have access to a better more attractive environment. These three pillars are closely 
connected and influence each other. It is a joint program on which the national government, City of 
Rotterdam, schools, welfare and housing associations and businesses collaborate. It focuses on the 
people to ensure that it meets the needs of residents. This is something that the Rotterdam Resilience 
Strategy Program considers important and supports. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

NPRZ is a prime example of an integrated approach. 
The program covers an extensive and active group 
of stakeholders at different levels together in a 
collaborative approach to address a large societal 
problem. The integrated approach focuses on both 
social and physical (between school, work and 
environment) to ensure that the outcomes are robust. 
The program is essential for social resilience in 
Rotterdam. It strengthens social cohesion in Rotterdam 
South while also focusing on opportunities for training 
and work to increase the resilience of individuals.

ROADMAP TO THE 
NEXT ECONOMY

The metropolitan region of Rotterdam – The Hague is working on the development of a Roadmap 
Next Economy (RNE). There are global economic and technological transitions that require investment 
projects in the region. The metropolitan region has mandated international economist and political 
advisor Jeremy Rifkin to the RNE. The RNE will include a strategy and implementation plan to 
maximize the opportunities presented by the ‘Next Economy’, including in the areas already identified; 
digitization of information, energy and mobility / logistics

These three pillars are included in RNE connected to the major economic clusters in the region, 
crossovers between the pillars and economic cluster innovations are encouraged. There are established 
specific working groups for the pillars. Work and lessons learnt from RNE will be supported and 
integrated to other initiatives. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

The integrated approach with numerous stakeholders 
used in the Roadmap to the Next Economy ensures 
that it is far reaching. There are concrete projects, 
results and commitments, which seek to enhance the 
ingenuity and flexibility of the region. This is necessary 
if the region is to cope with the exponential changes 
taking place globally.

1 KM2 SUSTAINABLE  
ROOFSCAPE CITY CENTRE

Rotterdam was the first municipality in the Netherlands to successful support green roofs, with currently more 
than 220.000m2 of green roofs in Rotterdam. There is even an award winning festival, Rotterdam Rooftops 
Day 2015. A policy program implemented green roofs as part of the climate adaptation strategy and 
Rotterdam received a C40 Cities Award in Paris for its work in this area. Challenges for water, greening, 
renewable energy, air quality and a lack of space can be addressed through an integrated approach to the 
development of green roofs. Techniques for greening roofs have developed and can now effectively cater to 
multiuse roofs including urban farming, solar panels, water storage and even sports facilities. These spaces 
can contribute enormously to the sustainability and viability of the city centre. It contributes to a favourable 
climate for businesses, tourism and offers an attractive and healthy environment for young families and 
professionals. This action for a sustainable roofscape brings the enthusiasm of Rotterdam and the policy 
objectives together to publicize the many opportunities of large scale green roofs retrofit. We are goaling 
green roofs covering 1,000,000m2 across our city centre. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

The program offers a distinct added value to 
Rotterdammers by encouraging a combination of 
integrated solutions such as solar panels above a 
green roof, for a higher return. In practice this means 
more water storage, increased permeability of the 
urban area, energy generation, greater ecological 
value, food production, cleaner air, health and social 
cohesion amongst other benefits. Adding value on this 
scale will be revolutionary for the city centre. Finally, 
the program can be deployed at short notice without 
major issues.

RESILIENT DELFSHAVEN
EXPERIMENTING WITH COOPERATIVE AREA DEVELOPMENT 

Merwede4havens (M4H) is a dynamic area with high levels of economic innovation, with new 
industries settling in the port area where existing port activities interact with innovative manufacturing 
and creative entrepreneurs. However, in the surrounding areas there are social issues with up to 25% 
unemployment, 80% of people are immigrants, there are rising debt problems and a struggle against 
drug trafficking and use and other nuisance behaviour. This is one of the most difficult urban 
environments in the Netherlands. However, at the same time, exciting and innovative initiatives are 
happening, such as syrups and Reading West that make neighbourhoods more vibrant and dynamic.  
A growing number of partners in both areas have forged a coalition around the Rotterdam 
Renaissance, where a connection is made between knowledge harbour M4H (economic innovation), 
and the manufacturing districts in West (social innovation). Through these actions, steps are being taken 
to help people to shape their own future. 

RESILIENCE VALUE

By relateding economic and social innovation robust 
networks have developed. It generates a shared 
ownership of the neighbourhood. This plan reinforces 
social cohesion and promotes social entrepreneurship. 
This increases the self–organizing capacity of the

RESILIENT PEPERKLIP

IMPROVING SOCIAL RESILIENCE, ATTRACTIVENESS, QUALITY OF LIFE AND 
FUTURE–PROOFING OF AN ICONIC BUILDING

The Peperklip was designed by architect Carel Weeber and built in the 1980s; the residential building 
occupies a small area, with a length of 500 meters; containing 605 homes. In recent years there has been 
considerable investment in improving the social issues in and around the development; unfortunately the 
investment has not been sufficient enough to bring about real change. 

The building is about to undergo a major physical renovation project, which can be used to jointly tackle 
the social and physical problems. The renovation includes 11.500m2 roof and semi–public courtyard which 
creates space for ‘place making’ as well as a combination of power, buffering and re–use of water, public 
spaces and gardens. There is also a unique opportunity to establish a related with the municipal 
contribution program for residents and the labor market. This will tackle the resilience of both the physical 
and social. The aspiration is for Peperklip to become an example of social resilience, in combination with 
physical climate resilience. The project has the potential to have the largest collective roof gardens in 
Europe. The project is supported and should seek to share knowledge and lessons as well as learn from 
other initiatives in this strategy.

RESILIENCE VALUE

A resilient system of governance is 
the foundation for a resilient city. The 
establishment of the resilient system of

INTERNATIONALE  
ARCHITECTUUR  
BIËNNALE ROTTERDAM

In January 2016 a letter of intent for cooperation on Resilient Cities was signed between the 
International Architectuur Bienales (IABR) and the Municipality of Rotterdam, for the period 
2016–2020. Both parties will use this time to focus on resilience, with content and financial 
support from the Rotterdam Resilience Program. The biennales will include collaboration 
with the government of the Netherlands, notably; Henk Ovink (Water Ambassador for the 
Netherlands) and will promote the UN’s Sustainable Development and Climate Goals (COP21) 
both fully endorsed and supported by the City of Rotterdam and the IABR. 

In 2018, the focus of the IABR ‘resilience + cities’ production will be on the physical aspects 
of resilience (adaptation to climate change, infrastructure energy, water issues, etc.), whereas 
in 2020, social and softer aspects will be the focus (social resilience, cyber resilience and 
resilience as a “new culture”). The question surrounding the resilience of ‘governance’ and what 
new financial development models can be developed; will be included in both editions.  
We will develop a joint research program about resilience by design stretching over the full 
four year period.

RESILIENCE VALUE

This long term partnership will not only contribute 
to knowledge development and sharing, but also to 
network development and ideas creation. Moving 
resilience into the design space facilitates innovation

44 RESILIENT ROTTERDAM—THE HAGUE 

METROPOLITAN AREA

Rotterdam—The Hague Metropolitan Area (MRDH) is a consortium of 23 municipalities. These 
municipalities have jointly invested in the Next Economy Roadmap (RNE). Many resilience issues 
extend beyond municipal boundaries. MRDH with interested municipalities, particularly The Hague, 
is cooperating to deliver concrete actions and results for resilience for the wider region. Rotterdam is 
sharing its learning from the 100 Resilient Cities process into this consortium, and the selection of The 
Hague by 100 Resilient Cities as a third wave city could give a further boost to the metropolitan region 
in terms of how it considers its future resilience across key areas such as water, climate and cyber.

RESILIENCE VALUE

•  Supports knowledge sharing and 

networking

•  Supports tackling of cross municipality 

issues and challenges

In October 2015, 28 Chief Resilience Officers 
and resilience team members from 9 cities 
convened in Rotterdam for a Network Exchange 
on integrated water management. Through site 
visits, expert presentations, and multi-disciplinary 
workshops involving more than 30 water experts 
from Rotterdam and the Netherlands, participants 
grappled with common challenges facing cities 
today – from flooding and sea level rise to water 
scarcity – and proactively shared knowledge and 
insights about each other’s successes and failures.
The Rotterdam exchange catalyzed some concrete 
actions, and attendees returned to their cities to act 
upon the lessons learned.

100 Resilient Cities member cities involved: 
Bangkok, Berkeley, Mexico City, New Orleans, 
Norfolk, Rome, Rotterdam, Surat and Vejle.
