LETTER FROM THE MAYOR

Maurice Armitage

The  people  of  Cali  have  been  resilient  for  many 
years, even when the concept of resilience was not 
well  known.  This  word,  which  may  sound  compli-
cated,  expresses  our  capacity  to  overcome  per-
sistent challenges and unforeseen events.
In 2015, Cali became the second Colombian city to 
join the rockefeller Foundation’s 100 resilient Cit-
ies program, and since then, the city has moved ex-
ceptionally fast to consolidate its resilience strate-
gy  especially  considering  the  challenges  it  faces. 
as mayor, I have provided my full support, and my 
team  is  committed  to  incorporating  resilience  in 
this administration’s work.
The  reasons  for  this  fast  development  are  two-
fold:  first,  the  municipal  Government  was  already 
strengthening its capacity to mitigate and respond 
to situations that pose a risk to its inhabitants; sec-
ond, several of this administration’s strategic proj-
ects pursue targeted and sustainable solutions to 
challenges that Cali has been facing for some time, 
which  must  be  resolved  to  guarantee  its  inhabi-
tants’ quality of life. 
Challenges faced by the city have made us under-
take the following: a comprehensive improvement 
in  our  educational  system  by  making  a  huge  in-
vestment  in  educational  infrastructure  and  qual-
ity;  efficient  urban  mobilization  through  changes 
to the mass transportation system and expansion 
of  its  supplemental  network;  water  management 
by reinforcing the jarillon (dike) that protects Cali 
from flooding of the Cauca river and ensuring the

potable  water  supply  both  during  drought  and 
rainy seasons; the reduction of violence by offering 
decent  life  alternatives  and  support  to  reincorpo-
rate young people involved in lives of violence into 
society as well as opportunities for young people 
marginalized  by  violence;  and  an  improvement  in 
our planning process thanks to tools that now pro-
vide  us  with  clear,  objective  information  that  will 
ultimately help us make informed decisions. 
The Santiago de Cali resilience Strategy provides 
a structured framework for these efforts. With this 
document  we  can  understand  that,  beyond  solv-
ing specific challenges, we are building a city with 
not only the capacity to overcome the challenges 
it has been facing for years, but that is also work-
ing on strategies for facing future challenges. I am 
confident that this publication will be our naviga-
tion guide to achieving these objectives.

LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF 100 RESILIENT CITIES

Michael Berkowitz

On  behalf  of  the  100  resilient  Cities  staff,  I  want  to 
congratulate  Cali,  mayor  maurice  armitage,  and  the 
Chief  resilience  Officer,  Vivian  argueta  Bernal,  for 
launching this resilience Strategy, an important mile-
stone for the city and our association. 
In  addition  to  being  one  of  the  oldest  cities  in  the 
americas,  Cali  is  also  one  of  the  most  important, 
not only in Colombia but in the region. It is a criti-
cal gateway to the Pacific, to the industrial interior 
of the country, and to all of South america. During 
the last few years, the city has made great progress 
in overcoming the economic stress and the violence 
that  beset  it  in  the  last  years  of  the  20th  century. 
This Strategy is intended to move forward on those 
efforts and other essential developments to guaran-
tee a more resilient city that can face the challenges 
of the 21st century.
The  resilience  Strategy  addresses  challenges  that 
have undermined Cali’s capacity for resilience. These 
challenges  include  acute  shocks,  such  as  a  floods, 
earthquakes  and  landslides,  and  chronic  stresses, 
such  as  endemic  crime,  poor  access  to  education, 
and  mobility  challenges,  that  rip  the  urban  fabric 
apart  and  exacerbate  impacts  when  they  occur.  a 
city will only become stronger if both type of chal-
lenges are addressed.
The resilience Strategy includes innovative initiatives 
that  not  only  address  these  challenges  but  that  are 
based on work already under way in the city. These 
include several education initiatives that foster invest-
ment in the educational quality as well as the physical 
infrastructure of educational institutions, all of which 
should  further  educational  opportunities.  These  ini-
tiatives aim to provide a solid foundation for the ed-
ucation of the city’s future citizens. The Strategy also 
targets mobility and stresses collaboration with SITm-
mIO on priorities for the mass transportation system, 
which not only impacts the most vulnerable areas but 
acts as a catalyst for the sustainable development of 
the city, the region, and the country.
It  is  also  important  to  acknowledge  mayor  armit-
age and his commitment to institutionalizing the Cali 

resilience  Office  from  the  very  beginning.  as  this 
document  shows,  the  integration  of  the  concept  of 
resilience across the structure of the municipal Gov-
ernment  and  with  the  municipal  budget  was  one  of 
the most critical actions taken. This investment in re-
silience is one of the most impressive in our network 
and a great example for other cities.
The dedication and hard work of the Chief resilience 
Officer, Vivian argueta Bernal, are clearly revealed in 
these pages, in initiatives that reflect months of col-
laboration and leadership. The document also shows 
the  commitment  and  support  of  mayor  armitage, 
which is so crucial for the future potential and effec-
tiveness of this ambitious plan.
While  the  launching  of  the  resilience  Strategy  is  a 
very  important  achievement,  work  is  far  from  being 
completed. a continuous effort and unwavering com-
mitment will no doubt be needed to make the vision 
described in these pages a reality. We look forward to 
continued collaboration with the city.

LETTER FROM THE CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER

Vivian Argueta

When  we  started  the  resilient  Cali  process,  we 
knew we were facing a great challenge; it was not 
an easy task to include an approach and a concept 
in the city agenda that were totally new for many 
people. We were aware, by then, of the great op-
portunity we had of being part of the 100 resilient 
Cities program, with access to a methodology and 
a  wide  array  of  international  experts  who  would 
help us understand our challenges, find solutions, 
and develop a long-term vision for the city. 
The tools for building this resilience Strategy were 
made  possible  thanks  to  the  support  of  mayor 
maurice  armitage,  the  entire  municipal  cabinet, 
and  the  technical  staff  of  various  organizations, 
particularly the staff of the Territories of Inclusion 
and Opportunities (TIO) and its Deputy Secretary. 
In  addition,  many  in  the  private  sector,  the  aca-
demic  world,  and  the  community  at  large  joined 
the project and provided us with information. 
It has been deeply satisfying as we’ve moved for-
ward  to  find  that  resilience  has  always  been  an 
underlying  feature  of  Cali’s  vibrant  and  diverse 
population.  This  is  clearly  demonstrated  by  the 
joy,  creativity  and  innovation  with  which  Cali  has 
always  faced  its  challenges.  resilience  makes  us 
see  these  challenges  from  a  different  perspective 
and think outside the box to get back on our feet. 
That said, we also need to develop a deeper under-
standing of the new physical and social challenges 

resilience has 

always been an 
underlying feature 
of Cali’s vibrant and 
diverse population.

emerging in the city so that we can turn them into 
opportunities and make decisions that will ensure 
a bright future for the city. Cali’s resilience Strate-
gy is an example of how important it is to work in a 
structured manner to achieve a common good. We 
are  focusing  our  efforts  on  providing  the  citizens 
of Cali with a better city, one with a good quality 
of life, a safe and healthy environment, an efficient 
public transportation system, and a quality educa-
tional system that is inclusive and provides oppor-
tunities  for  all.  With  everyone’s  participation,  we 
will continue working together to make Cali a more 
resilient city.

Santiago de Cali is facing the challenge of overcoming 
the many obstacles that have built up over the 
years. This Resilience Strategy identifies concrete 
ways for the city to move forward. Cali seeks to 
be a resilient city that progresses through the 
diversity of its people and creates opportunities 
for all, while preparing to face its challenges with 
quality education, new transportation options, and 
respect for the environment.

In 2015, Cali was chosen to be a member of rockefeller Foundation’s 100 resilient 
Cities  program.  as  a  member  of  this  network,  the  city  is  provided  with  the 
resources needed to develop a roadmap to resilience along four main pathways:

a methodical, highly participatory 
process was conducted to design 
this  resilience  Strategy.  The  pro-
cess  was  divided  into  three  pha-
ses,  and  the  first  began  in  2016. 
During  the  first  phase,  a  Chief 
resilience  Officer  (Vivian  argue-
ta) was appointed and an assess-
ment of Cali’s current state was a 
conducted (Preliminary Resilience 

Assessment).  Phase  2  analyzed 
the  challenges  identified  during 
Phase  1  in  further  depth,  and  the 
strategies  that  make  up  the  re-
silience  Strategy  were  prepared. 
Phase  3,  which  began  with  the 
launching of the resilience Strate-
gy,  consists  of  implementing  the 
5 lines, 11 goals, and 45 initiatives 
summarized below.

Resilience is defined as the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, 
businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt and grow, no matter 
the  challenges  they  experience.  For  a  better  understanding  of  this  concept, 
challenges are classified as acute Shocks —sudden, unexpected one-time events 
affecting  cities,  such  as  earthquakes,  floods,  and  cyber  attacks—  and  chronic 
stresses —day-to-day or cyclical situations that weaken the fabric of a city over 
time,  such  as  high  unemployment,  violence,  water  shortages,  or  a  poor  public 
transportation system.

Santiago de Cali is 
the capital city of the 

Department of Valle 

del Cauca. It is located 

between Cordillera 

Occidental and the 

Cordillera Central 

in the Colombian 

andes, which makes it 

vulnerable to seismic 

events. Founded in 1536, 

it is one of the oldest 

cities in the americas. 

3.1

CONteXt

With a population of about 2.4 million 

inhabitants, Cali is the most important city in 
southwest Colombia and on the Pacific Coast.

The  city  is  the  third  largest  in  the 
country, with a population of about 
2.4 million inhabitants, which makes 
it  the  most  important  city  in  sou-
thwest  Colombia  and  on  the  Paci-
fic  Coast.  The  city  has  the  largest 
afro-Colombian  population  in  the 
country, making up 23% of the city’s 
overall population.

There  are  22  city  districts  and  15 
rural  districts  in  Cali.  The  335  neigh-
borhoods in the urban areas represent 
98%  of  the  municipality’s  population 
and  84  rural  settlements  represent 
the remaining 2%. 

The structure of the municipal Go-
vernment is described as follows: The 
mayor is the top official of the city. The 
executive  branch  is  divided  into  24 
municipal  entities,  including  15  secre-
tariats that are in charge of managing 

and  executing  the  mayor’s  Develop-
ment Plan; 9 departments that provide 
guidelines  and  ensure  administrative 
operations;  and  14  decentralized  enti-
ties,  including  the  healthcare  networ-
ks,  the  Urban  redevelopment  autho-
rity (EmrU), the Cali Utility Company 
(EmCaLI),  the  Public  Transportation 
authority (metro Cali S.a.), and others 
(Corfecali, the Special Housing Fund).

Given its geographic location, Cali 
connects  to  the  Buenaventura  Har-
bor on the Pacific Coast and with the 
Yumbo  Industrial  Center  to  the  nor-
theast. The city is an important point 
along  the  Pan  american  Highway 
and  therefore  an  essential  connec-
tion  between  Colombia  and  Ecua-
dor. This easy access makes Cali one 
of  the  main  economic  and  industrial 
centers of Colombia.

TIMELINE

( 1 9 4 0   -   to day )

In  the  second  half  of  the  20th 
century,  the  city  experienced 
social,  economic  and,  above  all, 
cultural  prosperity,  and  became 
internationally known for culture, 
sports,  and  the  entrepreneurial 
drive  of  its  citizens.  The  depart-
ment  of  the  Valle  del  Cauca  is 
the  most  important  agro-indus-
trial  center  of  southwest  Colom-
bia. From 1946 to 1960, Cali built 
large  companies  and  attracted 
multinational  industrial,  pharma-
ceutical and chemical companies, 
as  well  as  paper  and  cardboard 
factories.  This  growth  brought 
about  progress,  investment,  and 

a  wave  of  migration.  Colombian 
sugar mills are a good example of 
this  growth.  They  are  located  in 
the valley of the Cauca river and 
encompassing an area that inclu-
des  more  than  47  municipalities 
of  Cauca,  Valle  del  Cauca,  risa-
ralda, Caldas, and Quindio. 

Between  1970  and  1990,  Cali 
endured one of the hardest times 
in its history due to drug traffic-
king and the armed conflict within 
Colombia. many people moved to 
Cali during these years, making it 
one of the cities with the greatest 
number of displaced people. The 
city  has  suffered  from  violence, 

corruption  and  unplanned  grow-
th, and is still suffering from their 
impacts.

In  recent  years,  the  city  has 
been  moving  in  a  positive  direc-
tion  and  has  continued  some  of 
the key programs established by 
prior  administrations.  One  such 
program  is  the  Territories  of  In-
clusion  and  Opportunities  (TIO) 
program,  which  contributes  to 
the  city’s  Sustainable  Develop-
ment  Objectives:  a  sustainable 
city  and  communities;  clean  wa-
ter  and  sanitation;  peace,  justice 
and  stable  institutions;  and  the 
reduction of inequality.

CALI IN THE
peACe prOCeSS

Given (...) the fact that the city has 
absorbed many victims of this armed 
conflict, Cali has put a huge effort into its 
legal response and measures to enforce 
the peace agreement.

after  4  years  of  peace  talks  be-
tween the Colombian Government 
and  the  Colombian  revolutionary 
armed Forces (FarC-EP), the two 
stakeholders  executed  the  Final 
agreement to End the armed Con-
flict in late 2016. after 50 years of 
armed conflict in the country, this 
was  a  transformative  event  for  it 
and for the world. One of the main 
stepping  stones  in  the  process  to 
end  the  conflict  was  the  approval 
in 2011 of the Law on Victims and 
Land  restitution,  which  explicit-
ly  acknowledged  the  existence  of 
an  armed  conflict  and  called  for 
compensation  for  the  victims  and 
the  pursuit  of  truth,  justice,  repa-
rations, and peace guarantees. 

Given  this  context  and  the  fact  that 
the  city  has  absorbed  many  victims 
of  this  armed  conflict,  Cali  has  put  a 
huge effort into its legal response and 
measures to enforce the peace agree-
ment.  In  a  recent  administrative  mo-
dification,  the  Peace  advisory  Body 
became the Secretariat of Peace and 
Civic  Culture,  which  has  two  subse-
cretariats: (1) Violence Prevention and 
Civic  Culture  and  (2)  Human  rights 
and  Building  Peace.  The  goal  of  the 
Secretariat of Peace and Civic Culture 
is  to  design  and  implement  policies, 
programs  and  projects  to  prevent 
violence, to peacefully settle any con-
flicts, to promote and protect human 
rights,  and  to  foster  a  peace  and  re-
conciliation culture and education.

In 2013, the Rockefeller 
Foundation created 
the 100 resilient Cities 
(100rC) program in 
response to the 21st 
century challenges 
that all cities in the 
world face, such 
as globalization, 
urbanization and 
climate change.

CITIES

member  cities  are  provided  with 
the  resources  needed  to  develop 
a  resilience  roadmap  along  four 
main pathways:
(1) Financial and logistical guidance 
for  establishing  an  innovative  new 
position in city government, a Chief 
resilience Officer who will lead the 
city’s  resilience  efforts  (2)  Expert 
support 
the  development 
of  a  robust  resilience  Strategy 

for 

(3)  access  to  solutions,  service 
providers,  and  partners  from  the 
private,  public,  and  nonprofit 
sectors who can help develop and 
implement  the  resilience  Strategy 
(4) membership in a global network 
of  member  cities  that  learn  from 
and  help  each  other.  The  100rC 
program provides its members with 
a  methodology  and  tools  that  can 
be adapted to their context.

Resilience is defined as 
the capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, 
businesses and systems 
within a city to survive, 
adapt and grow no matter 
what kinds of acute shocks 
and chronic stresses they 
experience.

In  2016,  Cali’s  work  began 
with a workshop to launch the 
100rC program, more than 120 
local  stakeholders  from  the 
public and private sectors, and 
civil  society  took  part  in  the 
workshop  (“Towards  a  resi-
lience agenda for Cali”), which 
aimed  to  identify  the  main 
challenges  the  city  faces  with 

respect  to  resilience.  Subse-
quently,  Vivian  argueta  was 
appointed  as  Cali’s  Chief 
resilience  Officer.  The  team 
she  created  is  part  of  the 
TIO  program,  and  it  works 
collaboratively  with  100rC 
and aECOm4 (Cali’s strategic 
partner)  to  implement  the 
resilience methodology.

The institutionalization of the Cali 
resilience Office began with its in-
clusion in the municipality’s admi-
nistrative  structure.  Office  space 
and a budget to support the resi-
lience team and were allocated. In 
addition, close relationships were 
fostered  with  the  various  munici-
pal  Government  entities  that  will 
execute  the  proposed  initiatives. 
among the most notable of these 

is  the  permanent  liaison  with  the 
International Cooperation and re-
lations Office, which will share the 
leadership of the implementation 
of the Urban resilience Index with 
the  Department  of  City  Planning 
and  the  Technical  management

pARTICIpATION

In  2017,  Cali’s  Preliminary  resilience 
assessment was published. This diag-
nosis of the city’s resilience identified 
Cali’s  weaknesses,  strengths,  capac-
ities,  challenges,  opportunities,  and 

cross-cutting  issues.  During  the  de-
velopment of this diagnosis, Cali’s re-
silience team used the following tools, 
which  were  designed  by  the  100rC 
program to facilitate the process: 

Facilitated the prioritization and 
identification of Cali’s weaknesses 
and strengths as perceived by 
its residents and experts from 
civil society and the private, 
public, and academic sectors.

Helped with the identification of the 
existing initiatives, programs, cam-
paigns, projects. and studies in civil 
society and in the private, public, and 
academic sectors that are contributing 
to Cali’s resilience (the public sector is 
leading the majority of these efforts). 

Identified Cali’s exposure 
to acute shocks (e.g., 
earthquakes, river floods, civil 
unrest) as well as the city’s 
important infrastructure that 
is so critical to its resilience.

The  assessment  process  brought 
together  more  than  400  partici-
pants. Interviews and focus groups 
were  held  with  Cali’s  fire  depart-
ment,  police,  academics,  journa-
lists,  handicapped  population,  wo-
men, 
judges,  entrepreneurs  and 
businessmen,  government  officials, 
private  sector  leaders,  community 
leaders, and ordinary citizens.

In addition, the assessment also 
took into account the results of two 

citizen perception surveys conduc-
ted  by  the  municipal  Government 
in  which  8035  and  3,7206  citizens 
of  Cali  were  surveyed  (INSearch 
and  municipal  Government  of  Cali, 
2017;  Corpovisionarios,  2016).  The 
surveys  revealed  citizens’  percep-
tions  of  the  city’s  status  on  topics 
related to the Conceptual resilien-
ce  Framework  components  (see 
page  38),  such  as  mobility,  health 
and the economy.

aS S e S S M e n t

The result of this process was the identification of three acute 
shocks and five chronic stresses that pose challenges for Cali. 

A C u T E   S h o C k S

eArtHQuAKeS

Cali is in the Northern Andes, which crosses Ecuador, Colombia 
and Venezuela, and its location is highly susceptible to seismic 
activity (DeMets et al., 1994).

FLOODS 
(froM riVer and heaVy rainfall)

Rainfall in Cali and Valle del Cauca is known to cause floods that re-
sult in significant property damage and loss of human life. The La 
Niña in 2010 was cause for alarm due to the vulnerability of the Cau-
ca River dike (jarillon), which nearly failed (Resilient Cali, 2017).

LANDSLIDeS

In  the  mountainous  areas  of  the  city,  there  are  informal  settle-
ments with structures that do not comply with seismic standards 
and  have  no  protection  against  earth  movements.  Consequently, 
they  are  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  heavy  rainfall  and  earth-
quakes (Corporacion OSSO, 2005). 

52

sudden or unexpected

affect the city, such

RESILIENT CALI |  A CITY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROGRESSday-to-day or cyclical 

events that weaken the 
fabric of a city over time, 
such as high unemployment, 
water shortages, and 
a deficient public 
transportation system.

C h R o N I C  S T R E S S E S

VIOLeNCe AND A LACK OF puBLIC SeCurItY 

Cali is still one of the cities with the highest homicide rates in the country. According 
to the Municipal Security Observatory, the city had 1,240 homicides in 2017 (a 5% 
reduction from 2016). The local homicide rate was 51 homicides for every 100,000 
inhabitants, while the national rate was 23.9 homicides every 100,000 inhabitants

eDuCAtION AND eDuCAtIONAL INFrAStruCture 

National standardized test results show that 50% of the public education insti-
tutions were deficient in providing a basic grade school education. In addition, a 
majority of the 342 educational institutions managed by the Municipality require 
repairs to their water and sanitation systems, and reinforcement of their buil-
dings, as they are not in compliance, partially or fully, with seismic-resistance 
standards and codes (Resilient Cali, 2017).

MOBILItY

The lack of traffic routes and coordinated multi-modal management of SITM-
MIO, the mass transit system, has been exacerbated by financial issues. As a 
result, the system has not become the primary transportation choice in the 
city  that  it  was  intended  to  be.  and  informal  public  transportation  networks 
have begun operating illegally in the city (Department of City Planning, 2016a)

DeFICIeNt CItY MANAgeMeNt   
and Urban Planning

The  city  has  lacked  a  strategic  vision  for  implementing  the  actions  of  earlier 
administrations and for working with the private and academic sectors and civil 
society. In addition, the lack of guidelines regarding standardization, integration 
and periodic municipal information updates is reflected in the inadequate moni-
toring of indicators (Resilient Cali, 2017).

WAter reSOurCeS AND SHOrtAgeS 

Pollution due to mining activities in the upper basins, waterway diversions for 
agriculture, contamination due to industrial and residential water waste, defores-
tation, extreme and more frequent climate events, among others, are the main 
threats to Cali’s water supply, with the potential to cause shortages in both the 
city and the surrounding areas (Resilient Cali, 2017).

vulnerabilities that needed addi-

During  this  second  phase,  the  five 
priority  issues  identified  in  the  Preli-
minary  resilience  assessment  were 
studied in depth to identify the under-
lying causes of each challenge. In ad-
dition,  various  organizations  and  key 
stakeholders  were  brought  together 
to  develop  initiatives  to  address  the 
identified  challenges.  These  initiatives 
were  prioritized,  validated  and  then 

incorporated  as  part  of  this  resilience 
Strategy.  a  work  plan  consisting  of  52 
detailed  tasks  was  prepared  to  guide 
the  work  during  this  phase,  which  ad-
dressed a set of questions arising from 
the  Preliminary  resilience  assessment. 
The work required research that ranged 
from stakeholders analyses to knowled-
ge exchanges, such as Cali Progresa-Li-
ving Lab (see page 99).

The final step of this second phase was prioritization,

developed  to  address  the  identified  challenges.  The 
initiatives  were  prioritized  by  their  potential  impact, 
difficulty  and  implementation  cost,  capacity  to  ad-
dress the root challenge, and importance to the city. 
Of  the  90  or  so  initiatives,  45  major  initiatives  were 
selected and then validated by the mayor of Cali, the 
initiative’s implementers, and the resilience Steering 
Committee so that they could be incorporated even-

Cali is located along the CAUCA RIVER, COLOMbIA’S SECOND MOST 
IMPORTANT WATERWAY,  which is at the city’s western edge.

To counter the river overflows and avoid 
floods, between 1958 and 1962 the REGIONAL 
DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (CVC) 
built a DIkE that is 10.56 miles (17 kilometers) 
long and 5.57 feet (1.70 meters) high.

From 2010 to 2011 Cali was one of the 
cities most affected by LA NIñA. The water 
levels reached by the Cauca River almost 
OVERFLOWED the height of the Jarillon.

Over the years, lack of control over the dike resulted 
in INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS and other constructions 
on top of the dike, which PUT ITS STAbILITY AT RISk. 

80%OF THE CiTy

wITHOUT POTAbLE 

WATER

DESTRUCTION OF THE JARILLON would cause economic 
losses of about 11,434 MILLION USD and would leave 
80 percent of the city without potable water. The city 
would no longer be able treat waste water and about 
900,000 inhabitants would be directly affected. 

The Cali Jarillón Plan megaproject is one of the most 
important risk mitigation initiatives in Colombia. 
The megaproject has been under way for the last 3 
years, and its lessons are relevant and timely.

desCRiPtion: 

The Secretariat of Education will establish a public policy on edu-
cational quality for Cali that is aligned to national policies but ad-
dresses the local context and needs. The policy will aim to increase 
educational quality by creating guidelines for teacher training, by 
fostering relevant and regular community involvement, by impro-
ving school environments, and by implementing information and 
communication technologies that support the learning process. To 
design this policy, the Secretariat of Education must conduct an 
analysis of lessons learned and best practices with respect to in-
tegrated school management, school environments, learning pro-
cess improvement, and the strengthening of relationships between 
communities and schools.

“Cali’s public education 
system has significant gaps in 
its educational performance”

Cali’s  public  education  system  has 
significant  gaps  in  its  educational 
performance.  In  domestic  standar-
dized  tests,  50%  of  public  grade 
schools  were  rated  as  deficient, 
while  only  34%  of  private  institu-
tions received the same rating (re-
silient Cali, 2017). Cali’s educational 
infrastructure  is  in  extremely  poor 
shape.  more  than  half  of  the  exis-
ting  infrastructure  requires  inter-
ventions  to  even  minimally  serve 
Cali’s  students  and  meet  seismic 

resistance  standards  (resilient  Cali, 
2017).
The  municipality  lacks  the  data  co-
llection  tools  and  management  sys-
tems to develop plans and strategies 
to  address  the  gaps  in  educational 
infrastructure  and  quality  and  the 
needs in real time. Public policies and 
strategies must therefore be accom-
panied by the development of tools, 
methodologies,  and  data  collection 
and  management  systems  to  facili-
tate and support the following goals:

the  city’s  educational  infrastructure 
will  be  upgraded  and  renovated,  its 
useful life will be extended, and it will 
be  prepared  to  function  during  and 
after an emergency.

IMPROVE 
EDUCATION DURING 
EARLY CHILDHOOD

In its journey to educate and create better citizens, Boston 
has prioritized the expansion of a high-quality early 
childhood educational system as well as the improvement of 
programs that enable young people to develop their social 
and emotional well-being. High-quality pre-school and early 
childhood education is part of the holistic development 
young people need, but due to persistent gaps, not all of 
Boston’s children have access to such educational choices. 
a study conducted by Columbia University in New York 
City (Belfield et al., 2015) shows the importance of this kind 
of education and explains that, on average, for each dollar 
investment in socio-emotional learning programs, there is an 
eleven-dollar return.

My CoMMunity is My sChool 

Is the largest investment made in the public 
education system in Cali’s history (more than 
170 million USD). The objective of this program 
is to improve the quality and relevance of the 
education offered in public schools, especially 
in the most vulnerable neighborhoods of 
Cali, and to reinforce the infrastructure of 
public education institutions that need more 
assistance. The program started in 2017 and is 
divided into the following components:

with the support of the rockefeller 
Foundation’s 100 resilient Cities 
program, organized a collaborative 
laboratory (CoLab) to develop 
knowledge and best practices to 
address the resilience of the city’s 
educational infrastructure.

Public Policy

desCRiPtion: 

The Secretariat of Education will establish a public policy on edu-
cational quality for Cali that is aligned to national policies but ad-
dresses the local context and needs. The policy will aim to increase 
educational quality by creating guidelines for teacher training, by 
fostering relevant and regular community involvement, by impro-
ving school environments, and by implementing information and 
communication technologies that support the learning process. To 
design this policy, the Secretariat of Education must conduct an 
analysis of lessons learned and best practices with respect to in-
tegrated school management, school environments, learning pro-
cess improvement, and the strengthening of relationships between 
communities and schools.

(i.e.,  information  on  curricula,  improvement  plans,  teacher  trai-
ning) from public education institutions. This platform will com-
municate with the educational infrastructure management tool. 
To feed data into the technology platform, a tool will be required 
to  collect  information  on  each  institution’s  educational  quality 
and the quality of their satellite schools. 

This initiative will gather standardized data on every public educa-
tional institution in Cali into a technology platform through which 
critical educational quality data can be viewed by the public in real 
time. In addition, it will provide the main stakeholders in the educa-
tional system (mEN, SEm, IEO) access to exactly the same data on 
public education institutions, students, and teachers, so that ever-
yone will be able to understand the specific needs of each public 
education institution and its satellite schools.

The Secretariat of Education will build and retrofit the educational

the situation in a significant number of schools in Colombia. This 
initiative seeks to strengthen the city’s educational quality by ex-
tending the number of hours in a school day, making a single shift 
the standard in all schools. To achieve this purpose, the Secretariat 
of Education must plan the use of physical and human resources so 
that Cali’s educational system can be migrated to a single shift and 
leverage national resources (50% of the investment needed) by this 
strategic investment in the implementation of the single shift.

The Secretariat of Education will create and implement a regularly sche-
duled, standardized assessment of Cali’s public educational infrastruc-
ture that will supplement the SICIED (the Educational Infrastructure In-
formation System of the National ministry of Education). To enable the 
Secretariat  to  manage  the  educational  infrastructure,  the  assessment 
system will require a simple technology platform that is easy to use and 
that includes the main information on public education institutions, on 
the progress of the retrofit plans for implementation of the single shift 
in schools, and on the application of the NSr-10 seismic resistance stan-
dards. In addition to the technology platform, the Secretariat will also 
require a systematic assessment tool or methodology to determine the 
general status and structural vulnerability of the buildings on public edu-
cation sites. This tool would be based on the standards for existing buil-
dings set out in the Colombian regulation for Seismic resistant Cons-
truction (NSr-10).

The assessment system will support financial planning for the mainte-
nance, retrofit and reinforcement of educational infrastructure. By provi-
ding up-to-date, standardized information on the status of Cali’s public 
educational infrastructure, the system will also enhance understanding 
of the degree to which that infrastructure is resilient.

Following  the  country’s  trend,  Cali  has  shown  an 
important reduction in its homicide rates. However, 
the  rates  are  still  significantly  higher  than  the  na-
tional  average  and  those  of  other  major  cities  in 
the country. 

Despite  the  efforts  the  city  has  made  through 
the various programs of the municipal Government, 
Cali still has a long way to go to significantly reduce 

all forms of urban violence (e.g., organized crime, 
gangs, intolerance, and domestic violence). Cali re-
quires an approach based on peace, security, and 
civic culture. In this approach, people are the stars 
in  their  own  transformation,  and  their  common 
aspirations  for  peaceful  coexistence  and  security 
require the commitment, sense of ownership. and 
shared responsibility of all the city’s residents.

High rates of violence, much of it involving young people, continue to occur in many areas of the city.
To address this, the following initiatives will be pursued:

2.1
DESIGN INTERVENTIONS THAT wILL bUILD PEACE AND 
PREVENT VIOLENCE.

2.2
STRENGTHEN INITIATIVES THAT FOSTER COEXISTENCE 
AND SUPPORT DIVERSITY.

The initiatives presented in this line aim to reduce homicide rates and other types of violence, and to sustain 
these reductions over time. Interventions that go beyond policing are therefore proposed. This is why Cali’s 
resilience team has been collaborating with the Secretariat of Peace and Civic Culture, the Subsecretariat of 
Territories of Inclusion and Opportunities, the Secretariat of Security and Justice, the Secretariat of Culture, 
and the Secretariat of Sports and recreation to develop a policy that will build a Cali where all people coexist 
in peace and security.

“in the last 10 years, the 
number of cars in Cali has 
doubled and the number of 
motorcycles has tripled.” 

In  the  last  10  years,  the  number  of  cars  in  Cali  has  doubled  and  the 
number  of  motorcycles  has  tripled  (Department  of  City  Planning, 
2016a).  Traffic  jams  in  the  city  occur  more  frequently  every  day  and 
this situation will only worsen if there is no commitment to developing 
alternative modes of transportation to Cali’s public transportation sys-
tem, masivo Integrado de Occidente (mIO). Until recently, SITm - mIO 
(who is managed by a descentralized entity called metro Cali S.a.) was  
facing  financial  and  legal  challenges  that  were  hindering  its  success 
and development.. But even without these factors, the system requi-
res interventions to achieve full sustainability. In addition, the current 
situation is exacerbated by the lack of infrastructure to support alter-
native  ways  of  getting  around  the  city.  In  light  of  all  this,  the  city  is 
pursuing the following goals:

3.1
ACHIEVE THE  
SUSTAINAbILITY OF THE PUbLIC  
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. 

3.2
STRENGTHEN THE  
SITM-MIO NETwORk AND ITS  
SUPPLEMENTARY SYSTEMS.

COMMUTER TRAIN NETWORK - To facilitate the 
commutes of residents of the suburbs of Santiago de 
Chile to and from the city, the region’s commuter train 
services are being strengthened by maximizing the 
use of the existing tracks, increasing the frequency of 
trains, and offering intermediate intermodal hubs at 
the stations. These strategies are the city’s alternative 
to building more highways and roads, which would 
only increase the use of private cars and encourage 
low-density urban sprawl with more people who 
would be highly dependent on the automobile. 

SANTIAGO pEDALEABLE pLAN - To developing an 
alternative means of transportation, Santiago de Chile 
created the Santiago Pedaleable (Bicycle-Friendly 
Santiago) plan, which seeks to boost the use of bicycles 
as a sustainable, clean means of transportation through 
investments, programs, projects, and multidisciplinary 
workshops throughout the metropolitan region.

groundwork for implementation of the subscriptions and zone ra-
tes. Subscription to public transportation is proven with a personal, 
non-transferable travel smart card that allows (1) a specified num-
ber of trips or (2) an unlimited number of trips in a specified time 
period. In the future, the public transportation system will cover the 
entire metropolitan area as well as other regions, so Cali must also

The entity to be created will contribute to the development of a 
multimodal metropolitan public transportation system with opera-
tional, physical and fee integration by including the railroad system. 
The system has the potential to gradually increase traveler capa-
city while reducing the urban pollution caused by the particulate 
emissions and fuel consumption of motor vehicle traffic. The sys-
tem  will  involve  mixed  use  of  the  railroad  tracks,  and  passenger 
and freight trains will be run on different schedules.

metro Cali, S.a. will work to give priority to SITm-mIO in mixed tra-
ffic lanes of pre-trunk corridors. The project consists of three stages 
and involves the introduction of mixed transit lanes into pre-trunk 
corridors, especially the right-hand lane of the road, to give prio-
rity to SITm-mIO buses to pass. Other vehicles will not be allowed 
to use the SITm-mIO preferred lane to pass but will be allowed to 
make specific maneuvers. This will help increase the frequency of 
SITm-mIO buses and reduce travel times for SITm-mIO users.

desCRiPtion: 

The stakeholders will improve regional accessibility and connectivity 
of the west’s mountainous communities to the flat region of Cali’s 
urban area by implementing a Supplemental Transportation System 
(STC) that will integrate physically and operationally with SITm-mIO. 
This system must guarantee universal accessibility as specified by 
national legislation. Given the topographic conditions of the zone, 
the  STC  must  have  a  fleet  that  is  appropriate  to  such  conditions 
and is approved by the Transportation ministry. Given that the inte-
gration depends on a centralized fee collection system and a fleet 
management and control system, the fleet must have devices insta-
lled for smart card payment, global positioning systems (GPS), and 
communications with the control center, among other physical and 
technological requirements.

“Climate Change in Cali may have serious 
environmental, economic and social effects”. 

CONVENTIONS

Potable  water  shortages,  which  will 
affect  basic  household  functions, 
and  temperature  increases  in  some 
areas of the city as well as the acute 
impacts  of  La  Niña  and  El  Niño  are 
some of the results of climate chan-
ge that Cali could face in the coming 
years. To be a resilient city, Cali must 
prepare  and  adapt  now  before  the 
effects  of  climate  change  become 
more common. multiple stakeholders 
must  collaborate  on  initiatives  that 
will  mitigate  the  effects  of  climate 
change,  especially  those  related  to 
the city’s water supply. 

Cali’s  strategy  for  preparing  for 
climate change is in the early stages. 
In the 2016-2019 municipal Develop-
ment Plan, climate change was not a 
specific component, but was addres-
sed in a general way. However, in 2016 
the Comprehensive Plan for Climate 
Change  Mitigation  and  Adaptation 
for Santiago de Cali was completed. 
This plan is a collaboratively develo-
ped technical and political road map 

that promotes climate change adap-
tation  and  mitigation  initiatives  that 
will support social, cultural and eco-
nomic development.

according  to  the  Secretariat  of 
risk  management  for  Emergencies 
and  Disasters,  only  one  of  the  seven 
rivers  crossing  the  city  has  accepta-
ble  water  quality.  The  other  six  have 
poor quality due to deforestation, ille-
gal mining, informal settlements, and 
inadequate  waste  disposal.  In  addi-
tion, tributaries of the Cauca river, in-
cluding the Pance, Lili, melendez, Cali 
and  aguacatal  rivers,  are  prone  to 
flooding,  and  vulnerable  populations 
illegally  settled  in  high-risk  zones 
contribute  to  the  degradation  of  the 
ecosystem.  In  addition,  urban  sprawl 
from  informal  settlements,  especially 
in the mountainous areas, contributes 
to  negative  impacts  on  biodiversity 
and  the  ecosystems  of  the  river  ba-
sins that supply water to the city.  

To face these challenges, the pro-

posals are as follows:

RAINFALL EARLY ALERT SYSTEM - To 
prepare for the frequent storms and floods 
the city faces, Da Nang seeks to create a 
flood early alert system. The city will build 
flood alert stations and install sensors in the 
rivers and ponds that currently lack them.

STRENGTHENING THE DISASTER 
MANAGEMENT CENTER - Da Nang also 
seeks to modernize and strengthen its disaster 
management center, which will require 
investment in facilities, electronic equipment, 
flood alert infrastructure, and human capital.

By developing 
initiatives related 
to these goals, the 
effects of climate

mitigated, and multiple 
stakeholders can join 
together to develop a 
public agenda that will 
ensure the population’s

an effective execution of the municipal Gover-
nment’s  work  plan,  embodied  in  the  munici-
pal Development Plan, requires a constructive 
planning  process  that  anticipates  unforeseen 
events,  sets  appropriate  goals,  aligns  stake-
holders  involved  in  execution  of  those  goals, 
and establishes initiatives that will enable com-
pliance with the proposed objectives. 

Decision  makers  tend  to  focus  their  ac-
tivities  on  resolving  day-to-day  situations, 
and  often  have  little  time  to  devote  to  me-
dium- and long-term strategic planning. Cali 
requires  a  public  administration  that  serves 
the  people  and  meets  their  needs,  and  that 
uses IT effectively to support it. The munici-
pal  Government  must  have  the  capacity  to 
plan  and  act  to  resolve  existing  challenges 

and secure early victories without forgetting 
about future generations.

more  specifically,  Cali  needs  a  central  da-
tabase where government entities, academics 
and civilians can provide input and access in-
formation.  The  absence  of  such  a  system  of-
ten results in planning processes that neither 
achieve  the  right  objectives  nor  comply  with 
strategic  plans.  Without  a  central  database, 
strategic  plans  cannot  be  developed  at  the 
same  time  as  budgets,  and  citizen  involve-
ment becomes more difficult. In addition, the-
re are no monitoring, tracking, and measuring 
mechanisms for plans, programs, and projects, 
and  no  objective  indicators  to  facilitate  deci-
sion-making in the public sector. 

This line proposes the following goals:

5.1
EFFECTIVELY MANAGE 
PUbLIC ADMINISTRATION.

5.2
DESIGN AN EFFECTIVE MONITORING, 
TRACkING, AND MEASURING SYSTEM. 

By  developing  these  goals,  the  municipal  administration,  using  IT  tools,  will  have  fact-based, 
reliable  and  updated  information  on  programs,  plans  and  projects,  which  will  then  assist  with 
medium and long-term planning and with achieving the municipal Development Plan’s objectives.

OpEN DATA pLATFORM -  rotterdam has developed 
a public database to increase city participation, 
transparency and collaboration with companies 
and academia. In addition, this database seeks 
to support innovation and to develop rotterdam 
into a “smart city.” The portal provides information 
about the city sewage system, the parking status 
in public parking lots, and the current air quality, 
and it also has aerial photos of the city.

index

This is an online 
tool that measures 
urban resilience. 
Cali was selected 
to implement 
this tool and is 
currently collecting 
information to 
identify its strengths 
and weaknesses 
around resilience. 
Eventually, using the 
tool, Cali will be able 
to compare itself with 
other cities in the 
100rC network.

A CROSS-CUTTING ISSUE FOR THE WHOLE STRATEGY

The lack of objective and centralized information on the municipal Government’s 
various programs, plans and projects is a bottleneck in the decision-making 
process. For that reason, the resilience Strategy concentrates on developing 
indicators for all lines and expects the municipal Government to take on the 
challenge of collecting information in a systematic way to make better decisions.

The Department of City Planning will create an investment project 
incubator with representatives from all municipal Government orga-
nizations. This incubator will facilitate knowledge exchange among 
those in charge of creating, modifying and monitoring the munici-
pality’s investment projects. The incubator will be led by the Depart-
ment of City Planning and will meet periodically. It will require a high 
level of technical expertise among its members to ensure effective 
planning,  investment,  and  project  execution  within  established  ti-
melines.  The  incubator  will  also  facilitate  monitoring  and  tracking 
of physical and financial resources, will identify alerts early on, and 
will make the production of reports for documentation much easier.

Cali’s resilience Strategy seeks to raise awareness of the city’s 
challenges  and  highlight  initiatives  that  are  developing,  or  will
