100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyForeword

Justin Lester 
Mayor of Wellington

Around the world, cities like ours are becoming the economic, social and cultural backbone 
of our countries. This represents an opportunity to lead the way like never before – but it also 
comes with challenges. 
Here in New Zealand’s capital we’ve had our fair share, and we know that our future holds more. 
Some – like earthquakes and sea level rise – have a measure of predictability. While we don’t 
know when they might happen, we do know what the effects will look and feel like. We’ve 
seen them before, often very close to home. For example, I believe we owe it to the people of 
Christchurch to take what we can from what their city has been through over the last 6 years.
But along with the more predictable challenges, there are shocks and stresses we don’t yet 
know about. 
What we do know is that resilient communities will pull together in times of adversity, while 
also having better lives each and every day. 
We also know there are things we can do today that will pay back exponentially when the 
time comes. Some things are simple, like getting to know your neighbours, but others are 
more complex, like investing in housing and transport frameworks to make them efficient 
and robust. By preparing now, we’re making sure we can rise to meet the challenges in the 
future.
This strategy lays out a coherent blueprint for dealing with future shocks and stresses. Some 
of the plans we have are short term and tactical; others are longer term and more strategic in 
nature. All of them have people at the centre. 
He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata.1
In recent years climate experts, disaster responders and sustainability proponents have come 
into rare alignment. They agree we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop and 
invest in a future for Wellington that ensures we will not only survive shocks and stresses, 
but also thrive afterwards.
On behalf of Wellingtonians, present and especially future, I would like to thank 100 
Resilient Cities – Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation, for their support, and I would like 
to thank the many people who contributed to the development of this document.
I’m privileged to be able to launch Wellington’s inaugural Resilience Strategy.
Tū whare ora.

Michael Berkowitz 
President  
100 Resilient Cities

Kia ora,
On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate Mayor Lester and 
the city of Wellington on the release of your Resilience Strategy. This is a major milestone for 
the city and 100RC’s partnership with “the world’s coolest little capital”.  
Wellingtonians have had a long history of resilient determination, whether as warriors, 
or pioneers, creating strong communities in this beautiful but sometimes harsh harbour at 
the southern tip of the North Island. Potentially destructive earthquakes, rising seas, and the 
city’s famous winds have kept Wellingtonians acutely aware of their vulnerability and helped 
hone their famous Kiwi ingenuity.
With the strategy, Wellington continues the serious work of ensuring that the city becomes 
resilient not only to the shocks of earthquakes but also the daily stresses that can be equally 
destructive, such as social and economic inequality, the physical integrity of the city’s 
houses, and issues of mental health and addiction that plague too many.
Wellington is changing; its population is growing and becoming more diverse. It is also 
getting older, and as the city welcomes newcomers who will enrich the city and ensure its 
vibrant future, this strategy provides for programmes for their employment and integration. 
As Wellington evolves, it must foster collaboration between its communities, provide access 
to information and services to all, and ensure meaningful involvement in decision making. 
This strategy emphasises that trust and collaboration are key – without them, true resilience that 
takes into account all of Wellington’s voices and concerns cannot be achieved. The ancient Māori 
legend of Ngake and Whātaitai beautifully illustrates the kind of inclusivity and resourcefulness 
that will support Wellington’s resilience journey in the coming years and beyond. 
Late last year the Kaikoura earthquake drove home the urgency of building this kind of 
resilience. It also highlighted a major reason why Wellington will undoubtedly be able 
to do so: Chief Resilience Officer Mike Mendonça. Mike’s work on the recovery after the 
earthquake shows he and his team have already begun the work of embedding resilience 
thinking into how the city manages its shocks and stresses. Rather than trying to defy nature, 
the Wellington Resilience Strategy seeks to live in tandem with it, using the challenges it 
poses as opportunities to become even stronger. 
This document is just the beginning, of course. As the capital city of a progressive nation, 
we’re looking to you to lead the way nationally and internationally; you’ve already begun to 
lead by example, and we’ve come to expect nothing less.

100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyMike Mendonça was appointed Wellington’s Chief Resilience Officer in 
December 2015 to lead development of this strategy. He now also manages 
the recovery efforts in Wellington following the Kaikoura earthquake and will 
oversee the implementation of this strategy. 

Resilient Wellington 
– a strategy

Fifty years ago, Wellington looked completely different to the way it looks today. It’s unlikely 
that Wellingtonians of the 1960s could have dreamed of how connected their children and 
grandchildren would be to each other and the rest of the world – virtually, through massive 
advances in technology and telecommunications, and physically, through a bustling 
international airport.
They probably wouldn’t have thought that our population would be 13 percent Māori, 
8 percent Pasifika and 8 percent Asian, with more than 80 ethnic groups and dozens of 
languages spoken on the streets. Nor would they have thought that Wellington could be 
transformed from a government town into “the coolest little capital in the world”.
While they might have expected earthquakes to be an ongoing worry, they would not have 
foreseen traffic congestion, people living rough in the central city, or that the climate would 
have changed to the point that we need to adapt our city to rising sea levels, and to more 
intense and frequent flash floods and high winds.
In another few decades, people will reflect on our time and wonder at the change that will 
have occurred between 2017 and 2050.
This strategy sets out a blueprint to enable Wellingtonians to better prepare for, respond 
to, and recover from disruptions. It is designed to maintain and build on the resilience 
momentum that has been generated to date. It outlines accountabilities and actions for 
change – its purpose is to make a positive difference. It is our vision that as Wellington moves 
and changes, everyone here will survive and thrive.
Three goals will support this vision: that people are connected, empowered and feel part 
of a community; decision making is integrated and well informed; and our homes, natural 
and built environment are healthy and robust. These goals will drive a series of strategic 
projects designed to shape our future city. Each of the projects signals a need to change from 
the status quo, such as preparing Wellington to adapt itself to the effects of sea level rise, and 
integrating recovery planning for the earthquake that we know will strike Wellington.
In developing this strategy, 200 people including infrastructure managers, researchers, 
community members, businesses and council staff from across the Wellington region 
imagined themselves in the shoes of their children and grandchildren in 35 years’ time. 
What will be the shocks and stresses they are likely to encounter, and what can we do today 
so that their lives – and ours – can be improved?  How can we be Resilient Wellington?
To help bring these likely experiences to life, we developed a ‘resilience story’ through a 
series of stakeholder workshops. The story follows a fictional family as they grapple with life 
in Wellington over the coming decades.
The story provided an inspiration and a test environment for a series of accelerated design 
workshops, where the actions that form this strategy have been developed, building on 
Wellington’s strengths.
We developed the strategy using four principles: to co-design wherever possible, to accelerate 
design, to use a strengths based approach, and to use story telling to communicate the 
resilience agenda.

100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyCo-design – To maximise involvement of the wide group of stakeholders and experts, covering all city resilience 
dimensions, the strategy content is primarily driven by the outputs of a series of design workshops.

Strength based approach – Specific focus to build on 
Wellington strengths has been applied during the 
appreciative enquiry workshops and led to development 
of our resilience graphic novel as well opportunities that 
were designed into resilience projects.

Accelerated design – Projects underpinning this strategy 
were developed at the Action Workshop modelled on a 
hackathon methodology and building on ideas generated 
through appreciative enquiry and story telling.

Story telling – This approach has been integrated into the strategy development from early stages to ensure that the 
strategy inspires and captures Wellingtonians’ imagination. Story telling was a focus of the Story Workshop and led  
to the development of our graphic novel.

This strategy heralds change – change that will require broad 

collaboration, strong leadership and tenacity supported  

by compelling evidence. 

Wellington isn’t just Wellington City. The Wellington 
region features a complex series of systems and 
relationships covered by nine different council areas. 
Shocks and stresses don’t respect the boundaries 
between these areas and nor does this strategy.  
While its primary focus is Wellington City, we have 

looked at it in the context of the wider region, especially 
the urban areas of Porirua and Hutt Valley. We have 
indicated where projects have a regional scope. 
In the middle of all this, the Kaikoura earthquake on 
14 November 2016 gave Wellingtonians a stark reminder 
of what an earthquake can do to a city.

In 2014 Wellington joined 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) – 
Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation. 100RC helps 
cities around the world become more resilient to the 
physical, social, and economic challenges that are a 
growing part of life in the 21st century. 100RC provides 
this assistance through funding for a Chief Resilience 

Officer in each member city to lead resilience efforts; 
resources for drafting a resilience strategy, including 
extensive reports from our Strategy Partner AECOM; 
membership in a global network of peer cities to share 
best practices and challenges, and access to a variety 
of resilience tools. 

ROUND ONE CITIES 
ROUND TWO CITIES
ROUND THREE CITIES

100RC has brought valuable experience, resources and connections 
to Wellington.  
Participation in the global network of cities developing their resilience 
strategies enabled us to exchange experiences, and Wellington has been 
an active member of the network. We shared knowledge and experience 
with cities facing similar challenges, including Boulder, Rotterdam, 
Singapore and Melbourne. Some of the ideas we came across are outlined 
in this strategy.
We are also working with a range of 100RC Platform Partners – a group 
of leading service providers who offer in-kind support to member cities. 
Among these are Veolia and The Nature Conservancy. 
100RC supports a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks (such 
as earthquakes, fires, and floods), but also chronic stresses that weaken the 
fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis. This view of resilience is 
not only about how to maintain a functioning city in emergency situations, 
but also how to contribute to a higher quality of life by enhancing 
economic, environmental and social outcomes during good times.
We used 100RC tools such as the City Resilience Framework (CRF) 
to ensure all of our projects generate resilience co-benefits. Instead 
of focussing on individual hazards we have focussed on actions 
that will build qualities such as flexibility, robustness, integration, 
resourcefulness, inclusivity and continuous learning into all of the city 
systems – our regulation, communities, infrastructure, and knowledge 
networks – so Wellington can survive and thrive no matter what shocks 
or stresses occur. 
At the action workshop we came up with 600 ideas to improve 
Wellington’s resilience. Using the CRF as a guide we then developed 
“power initiatives” that generate the most benefits across multiple 
resilience drivers, engage a broad range of people, and generate equitable 
outcomes in the short and long term. We have settled on 30 projects that 
complement each other and apply across multiple goals and programmes.

100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyReading this strategy

The process allowed Wellingtonians to define resilience 
for their own city, and to come up with the most important 
areas for investment. This was no easy task, as it quickly 
became clear that the word resilience means different 
things to different people. It was very important to build 

on experiences around the world and to understand what 
resilience means for Wellington.  Once there was a common 
understanding, it became much easier to challenge the 
status quo, and to focus on the areas and initiatives that 
could really make a difference.

This strategy is about change. Current and future changes to the ocean, 

land and our society will drive our decisions. 

This strategy is divided in two parts

City Resilience Framework

The City Resilience 
Framework (CRF), developed 
by Arup and The Rockefeller 
Foundation, identifies 12 
drivers of resilient cities 
across the areas of health 
and wellbeing, economy 
and society, infrastructure 
and environment, and 
leadership and strategy. 
We used this tool to assess 
the completeness of our 
current initiatives and 
understand various city 
systems’ ability to cope 
with shocks and stresses. 
We also used it to ensure 
we had a representative 
sample of people and 
organisations contributing 
to the development of the 
strategy. The tool enabled 
us to broaden thinking in 
Wellington beyond disaster 
preparedness and recovery 
and ensure that the initiatives 
identified will make the 
best ongoing contribution to 
building the city's resilience. 

Our resilience story

100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyOur Resilient Wellington vision is that:

As Wellington changes, 
everyone here will 
survive and thrive.

Wellington’s resilience challenges originate 
from three big systems on the move. 

Our society is transforming.

Wellington’s population is growing. It is getting older, more diverse and less equitable. Some 
of our homes, instead of being a source of resilience, are cold, wet and unaffordable. New 
people are arriving – some will struggle to develop skills and find jobs. Some of our citizens are 
disconnected from society, living on the streets at the mercy of their mental health issues or 
substance addictions. Communities and the public and private sectors must share information, 
trust one another, and work together more effectively to develop a better resilience culture.

The earth is moving in Wellington.

A significant seismic event is inevitable. Current efforts are focussed on saving lives but our 
buildings will be damaged and it will take time before we can use them again. The energy, 
transport, water and telecommunications infrastructure that serves our communities, our 
Government and our business sectors are centralised and vulnerable. Central Wellington 
generates eight percent of national GDP and 48 percent of regional GDP. If the robustness 
and integration of knowledge, planning and governance in Wellington isn’t improved, the 
consequences could be socially and economically significant. 

The sea is rising.

Extreme weather is already affecting our coastline and low-lying parts of the city, damaging 
seawalls and flooding homes. More intense rain and wind will cause more flooding in our streets, 
land slips on our hills, damage natural and built assets, and increase maintenance costs. We are yet 
to understand climate change’s physical, financial, cultural and social implications, and how we 
should adapt. We have many strengths – including a stunning natural environment and insights 
from Māori culture on integrating human activities with nature – but we must collaborate within 
Wellington, New Zealand and even globally to find long-term solutions.

People are connected,

Our connections in the community provide us with informal support 
and shared resources, such as locally grown food, car pooling options, 
and opportunities to socialise. As our city grows and our systems are 
stretched, people in communities that are cohesive and empowered will 
be better able to support each other through disasters, as well as thrive 
in the face of everyday challenges.

1980

2011

Between 1980 and 2011,  

New Zealand was in the top five OECD countries in terms of income 

inequality, with the increasing divide believed to be a significant handbrake 
on overall economic growth; nationally, income inequality is estimated to 
have reduced economic growth by almost 15 percent over the last 20 years. 

(OECD, 2014) 

29 percent of Māori 
and almost half of 
Pasifika were living 
in the most deprived 

neighbourhoods. 

(CCDHB, 2015)

Māori and Pasifika were 
twice as likely as others to 
be admitted to hospital for 
an avoidable condition in 
the Hutt Valley DHB area, 

with Māori 70 percent 

more likely in the Central 
and Coast DHB area (which 
takes in Wellington City, 
Porirua, Tawa and the 

Kāpiti Coast). 
(CCDHB, 2015)

Programme 1.1 
Everyone thrives

We will enable all Wellingtonians to have 
an opportunity to enhance wellbeing for 

themselves and their communities.

While most Wellingtonians 

have high levels of education 
and income, there are 

pockets of severe deprivation with high 
support needs and more limited access 
to services. Māori, Pasifika and refugee 
populations are over-represented in 
these areas. We are also not comfortable 
with the number of people living rough 
on our streets in recent years.
This sort of inequality can be a self-
fulfilling cycle that entrenches existing 
disadvantage. Due to increasing 
pressures on housing affordability, 
people on lower incomes often have 
to settle for cold and damp housing 
in areas with limited access to public 
transport and other essential services. 
These factors can contribute to poorer 
health, reinforcing existing economic 

Wellington is in an area prone to a 
range of acute shocks. Our essential 
services are vulnerable to disruption, 
meaning that Wellingtonians need to 
take greater responsibility for their 
preparedness and ability to ensure 
their basic needs are met. At present, 
many Wellingtonians may be unable 
to access household items and services 
that can improve their resilience. Some 
may not be able to afford them, while 
others may not have access to them due 
to lack of awareness, physical isolation, 
or language barriers.

deprivation and social isolation 
through reduced ability to work, 
and lower capacity to be prepared for 
disruptive events.
Wellington’s population is also 
ageing – by 2030 the number of people 
over 65 will double. This will place 
increased pressure on our healthcare 
system and aged care support services, 
and there will be a smaller percentage 
of working aged people to fund these 
services through taxes. We need to 
reassess how our infrastructure, 
including housing and our transport 
system, supports the needs of older 
residents. Employers will need to 
prepare for a higher percentage of older 
workers. Wellington’s ethnic mix and 
skills pool are also changing but we 
have even less information on that.

Prepare for an 
ageing population

1
Improve access 
to household 
resilience items

Lead
WCC and WREMO
Scaling up existing regional project
We will improve access to household items that enhance preparedness and 
recovery, ensuring that all Wellingtonians can survive in their own home for 
at least the first 7 days after a major shock event.

Action
This project will promote and scale up existing education programmes, services 
and products such as household water tanks, items for urban agriculture and 
Grab&Go bags. In addition, we will explore partnership opportunities with 
the private sector around new, affordable products that improve personal 
preparedness for shock events and improve day-to-day wellbeing, such as 
home kits to secure house foundations, and partnerships with nurseries to 
supply fruit trees and other produce that can be grown at home. The project will 
also investigate how to reduce cost barriers to access these products through 
subsidisation and private sector involvement. Other barriers will be considered too 
– we will partner with local trusted networks (for example, community groups and 
elders) to broaden the reach into more communities.

Resilience co-benefits
This project will build the capacity of vulnerable Wellingtonians to support 
themselves in the event of a shock (Project 18). Resilience resources will increase 
community confidence and also benefit Wellingtonians outside times of shock, 
improving social cohesiveness and reducing inequality (Project 4).

Key partners
WREMO, Universities, Office for Seniors

Lead
WCC
New Wellington City project
We will plan our transport, housing, health system and social spaces to enable our 
ageing population to fully participate and contribute to the economic and social 
life of our city.

Action
The Council will host a symposium to discuss and share existing local efforts and 
international best practice in approaches to catering for ageing populations. It will 
bring together people from a wide range of backgrounds including senior and youth 
associations, health sector, sport and aged care industry, as well as architects, 
transport and urban planners. Topics will include examples from other 100RC cities 
and the WHO Global Network of Age Friendly Cities and Communities.
The symposium will be followed by a research project and spatial mapping of 
existing services for seniors and a loneliness index. The project will provide 
recommendations for changes required to prepare for a larger aged population. 
A multiagency steering group is proposed to oversee the project.

Resilience co-benefits
As a result of this project, our aged population will, over time, have access to 
more suitable housing, mobility options and healthcare. The project will focus 
on enabling this growing subset of our community to contribute actively to the 
economic (Projects 8, 10) and social life (Projects 4, 5) of our city, thus generating 
benefits for us all. Applying universal design principles will make our housing and 
open spaces more flexible and inclusive (Project 20). This will also ensure seniors 
are able to cope in an emergency as well as to provide support for others.

By better integrating seniors into society 
we will enhance their ability to cope 
in an emergency as well as provide 
support for others.

Reduce homelessness

Key partners
Housing New Zealand, Te Whakamura Ai te Ahi

Lead
WCC
Scaling up existing city project
We will reduce street homelessness in Wellington and integrate the most 
vulnerable people into society by enabling access to housing and partnering with 
health, social services and other support agencies.

Action
Te Mahana is a community driven strategy to reduce homelessness in Wellington. 
Given that Māori are over-represented in those experiencing homelessness, the 
strategy has been built with strong Māori input, providing a cultural perspective 
on homelessness, which is essential to changing outcomes for Māori in this area.
The work of Resilient Wellington has identified that the additional success of 
this strategy will require greater investment and focus. The programme will be 
expanded so that frontline staff can work one-on-one with homeless people – 
this project will provide funding and training for these staff.

Resilience co-benefits
As well as building greater awareness of the challenge posed by homelessness in 
Wellington, this project will give more of our citizens a chance to be self-sufficient  
and an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to our communities (Projects 4, 10, 18).

Preventing homelessness should start with 
looking after our mental health.

Bristol

Inspiration from the 100RC Network  
– Homes4Bristol
Rather than searching for the elusive ‘silver bullet’ solution to homelessness, Bristol 
has settled on a mature and realistic mix of approaches to combat what is invariably 
a complex problem.
Bristol is building on already successful programmes (such as better use of otherwise 
empty homes) to combat homelessness.
The city is now investing in early intervention and better co-ordinated social services 
to prevent homelessness in the first place, with a particular focus on youth. At the same 
time, Bristol deals assertively with the existing problem. This is supported by analysis 
that reinforces co-benefits to healthcare and other policy areas if homelessness can be 
prevented in the first place. There is further focus on making it easy for people to move 
on as soon as they are ready, and to prevent repeat homelessness.
Wellington will continue to look to Bristol and other parts of the 100RC network to 
combat homelessness.

100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyProgramme 1.2 
Community resilience

We will build on existing strengths to develop 

innovative programmes that connect and empower 

communities to improve their wellbeing.

Resilient cities are integrated 

and resourceful. They harness 
connections between systems 
and institutions to generate multiple 
benefits, seeking better ways to use 
existing resources. At the core of these 
principles is sharing – something 
most Wellingtonians do regularly. We 
have a number of start-ups related to 
car sharing and communal gardens, 
and we have realised the benefits of 
shared spaces for innovative thinking 
through initiatives such as the 
BizDojo community space and Urban 
Agriculture programme.
This idea of sharing is nothing new to 
Māori, for whom manaakitanga2 and 
papakāinga3 are traditional values. 
These values came to the fore in the 
response and recovery phases of 
the Canterbury earthquakes. Marae 

facilities around the country, including 
Wellington, were opened up to the 
whole community for accommodation, 
catering and support. Māori 
communities were among the hardest 
hit by the earthquakes, and marae 
became a central hub for the Māori 
response and recovery. 
Following the earthquakes, the marae 
network wasn’t just about buildings 
and facilities. It was as much about 
leadership and governance – leaders 
with the autonomy to act quickly 
within an existing chain of command. 
These same attributes will be critical 
in addressing Wellington’s next major 
shock and chronic stresses.
Wellington’s changing size and 
demographics require us to think 
differently about how we design and use 

our urban areas and common spaces. A 
key part of this will be multi-purpose 
places that enable safe gathering during 
or immediately after a shock, drive 
social connections and innovation 
every day, and provide a location for 
shared and distributed infrastructure. 
If these spaces are to meet the needs of 
our communities, we’ll need to forge 
meaningful partnerships to understand 
their diverse and evolving needs, 
ensuring they are actively involved 
in decisions around new spaces and 
infrastructure. While neighbourhoods 
will always be important, it’s also about 
engaging with communities of interest, 
as well as virtual communities who 
connect online.

Currently, 90 percent of Wellingtonians feel they 

have someone to rely on for help if faced with physical 

injury or illness, or if in need of support during 

an emotionally difficult time. 

(WCC, 2015a)

Ten percent do not. That’s not acceptable. 

We are working to develop 

‘zero tolerance to loneliness’ 

in Wellington.

PROJECT

We are looking at how we can expand successful ideas 
in our #wellynextdoor programme such as Neighbours 
Day Aotearoa and Growing Neighbourhoods.

Neighbours Day Aotearoa’s purpose is to build 
community resilience, stronger neighbourhoods 
and to encourage neighbours to get to know each 
other because in emergencies they’re likely to be 
the first to help. 
Growing Neighbourhoods connects people with  
food and is a great way to increase social interaction.

Existing efforts to 
build our resilience – 
Strathmore 44

Strathmore 44 is an example of a programme where challenges including 
poor urban design, aged social housing and high levels of deprivation 
were addressed with a community-led process. A community priority is 
the need for an innovative space that delivers services, social interaction, 
and meets cultural needs, ensuring a resilient, collaborative community. 
This grows trust, pride and collaboration.

In July 2012, the nine councils of the Wellington region 
amalgamated their respective Civil Defence Emergency 
Management functions. The resulting organisation, 
WREMO, is a semi-autonomous organisation with a 
small core of staff that draws on the resources of the 
region’s councils, as well as the benefits of modern 
technology. The organisation has been structured 

with more than one-third of its resources dedicated to 
working with and empowering communities to build 
resilience to an emergency event. 
This approach includes heavy investment in community 
development and participation, placing a strong 
emphasis on end-user perspectives and fostering robust 
social networks that help people address the challenges 
in their day-to-day lives, as well as those that occur 
following a major shock event.
With the Joint Centre for Disaster Research, WREMO is 
a founder of the International Centre of Excellence for 
Community Resilience.

Red Cross, NZ Post

Scaling up existing regional and Wellington City projects
We will develop and grow innovative programmes that empower communities 
to increase people’s wellbeing and emergency preparedness, connecting them 
to each other and their city.

Action
This project builds on existing engaged and connected communities, as well 
as current community resilience programmes. It will be run in two streams 
coordinated by the Council and WREMO.
The Council will expand the #wellynextdoor programme and, with the 
community, develop a series of events in streets and apartment buildings. It 
will also expand the existing participatory, place-based, co-design approach to 
community planning used in Strathmore Park and Newtown to develop similar 
projects in other communities in the future. The team will identify opportunities 
to develop new community spaces, such as community dojos, where a range of 
people and organisations can use the space to increase social connection and 
cohesion. All of these places need to be included in disaster planning as alternative 
shelter and work spaces. We will explore options to make funding accessible to 
groups and organisations that may not be legal entities.  
WREMO will scale up its community response and resilience planning with 
councils throughout the region to expand opportunities to address community 
vulnerabilities and incorporate urban planning at the neighbourhood level. They 
will work with local leaders to build on their existing strengths and develop 
tailored community-led initiatives. WREMO, with support from key partners, 
will be offering emergency preparedness training and community preparedness 
workshops with schools, businesses, NGOs and residents. This will include a new 
Community Leadership module that will focus on helping local leaders direct their 
communities through change and times of stress.
The two streams of work are complementary, and a collaborative, participative 
approach to their design and delivery activities will be taken. They will also link 
the initiatives with wider planning frameworks.

Resilience co-benefits
Engaged and empowered communities are at the heart of Wellington’s resilience. 
This project builds further opportunities for neighbours to meet and make changes 
to their community that improve their day-to-day wellbeing, while at the same time 
developing connections and collaboration skills that are essential in emergencies.
The project will support flexible and inclusive local initiatives with specialist 
knowledge and resources. The Council and WREMO will ensure the initiatives 
are coordinated at a regional level and are well connected to urban planning 
and other city functions.
Increased community investment in neighbourhoods will lead to healthier and 
safer communities, generating education and employment opportunities and 
improving day-to-day wellbeing.
This project relates strongly to action on household resilience (Project 1), 
community spaces (Project 5), new economic hubs (Project 8) and climate 
action (Project 17).

Helping communities to become resilient is 
not just about disaster preparedness. Increased 

community investment in neighbourhoods 

will lead to healthier and safer communities, generating 
education and employment opportunities and 
improving day-to-day wellbeing.

Develop sustainable 
food networks 

Action
Drawing on WREMO’s community response planning and the Council’s urban 
development process, the project team will work with land use planners, 
infrastructure owners, iwi and businesses to draw greater benefits from multi-
purpose spaces in Wellington. 
The project team will build on existing work by Victoria University of Wellington 
School of Architecture and Design to expand their research on the city’s open 
space network for post-disaster housing, economic continuity, education and 
healthcare provision. The team will undertake an assessment to identify the 
potential for new and existing spaces such as parks, gardens, community dojos, 
offices and cultural venues to be developed or redeveloped to incorporate a 
disaster resilience component (such as water sources, food production, electricity, 
shelter and so on) while enhancing them to maximise their contribution to 
community wellbeing. A special focus will be given to providing space for 
volunteers. Ensuring these spaces are accessible to vulnerable Wellingtonians, 
such as the elderly, ill and recent arrivals, will be a key consideration in this 
process. Enabling local communities to be part of the design/redesign of those 
spaces is also critical to ensure they meet evolving needs.
These places will be the key locations for back-up power and water supply as well 
as for storage of maintenance and emergency supplies.

Resilience  co-benefits
All Wellingtonians have the opportunity to benefit from this project. Rethinking 
our existing open and community spaces so they can serve multiple purposes 
supports the quality of resourcefulness – seeking to do more with what we have, 
sometimes at little additional cost (Project 6 and 24). When well designed, those 
new or redeveloped spaces will provide people with enhanced opportunities to 
connect and collaborate in good times (Project 4), build valuable knowledge and 
networks (Project 8) (like skills or resources to help recovery), as well as enable 
people to self-organise more easily in the event of a major disaster.
Those spaces will play a major role in ensuring people have access to basic 
services – food, water, shelter, warmth and so on – soon after a major disruptive 
event (Project 18).

We will develop a sustainable food network building on current initiatives and 
creating new programmes that meet social and health needs as well as ensuring a 
robust food distribution network post emergency event.

Action
The Council will expand its current urban agriculture programme to map 
and connect existing community food projects. We will identify partnership 
opportunities with groups targeting child obesity, type 2 diabetes, families 
in need, marae, mental health, seniors, refugees, and prisons to develop new 
community gardening projects. We will also identify communities in need and 
establish coordinators there to run community garden programmes.
We will support the establishment and growth of local food businesses through 
the Good Food educational and mentoring programme and community funding. 
We will also explore food distribution models to develop a plan for Wellington in 
the event of a shock.

Resilience  co-benefits
This project will teach potentially vulnerable Wellingtonians how to grow food 
for their own use and to establish small businesses. This can support their 
physical and mental health, wellbeing and provide a new source of income 
(Projects 1, 2, 10). The project provides an opportunity for refugees, aged or 
other people disconnected from the wider society to integrate back into their 
neighbourhoods (Project 3).
It also makes more local food available in an event where Wellington has reduced 
connection with the rest of the country (Project 18).

Urban agriculture can support physical and mental health, 
wellbeing and provide a new source of income.

A sense of place – of who 
we are and what we stand 
for – is a big part of resilience. 
We need to protect it.

Key partners
Building owners, MBIE

Lead
WCC
Scaling up a Wellington City project
We will develop risk management plans for selected heritage areas to guide pre-
disaster investment.

Action
This initiative sets out to identify the most highly valued heritage areas, and to 
formally plan to invest in their resilience.
The Government has recognised that unreinforced masonry facades and parapets 
in Wellington present a risk to public safety, and has allocated funding to mitigate 
the risk. Many of the relevant buildings are in heritage areas. The Council will use 
a risk management framework to work with relevant agencies and building owners 
to better secure these heritage assets.
Wellington is already strengthening earthquake-prone buildings; this initiative 
will provide prioritisation for funding and the development of guidance for post-
event decision making. It will also consider ways disaster resilience investment 
can improve the use of heritage places.

Resilience  co-benefits
Pre-event preparedness will allow robust and considered post-event action, 
enabling us to better protect our sense of who we are and what we stand for. 
This project will enable more inclusive management of our heritage. It will be 
incorporated into wider community resilience building work (Project 4, 5, 14).

Byblos

Inspiration from 100RC network  
– Byblos's approach to managing their heritage
Byblos has dedicated a pillar of its Resilience Strategy to the protection and celebration 
of its natural and cultural heritage as a catalyst for improved economic development, 
community engagement, participation and social cohesion. The city worked with 
Platform Partner Swiss Re to conduct a tsunami simulation on the Old Port after it was 
damaged by storm Zina in January 2015. Old Port and some older religious buildings 
have been confirmed to be at risk from coastal flooding. It is predicted that the largest 
tsunami could create a 6-metre wave in the port area; this type of event has a return 
period of around 2000 years, while a smaller tsunami of 1–3 metres may re-occur every 
300–1000 years. Following the work undertaken, Byblos is  developing measures, 
guidelines and frameworks to protect the city’s historic assets, including developing 
affordable restoration techniques for property owners to carry out. Training and 
implementation is being incentivised by loans and tax deductions.

100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyProgramme 1.3 
Economic resilience

We will support our business community 
to improve preparedness and strengthen 

our economic activity.

Over 90 percent of businesses 

in Wellington have nine or 
fewer employees. While small 

can mean agile, small-to-medium 
enterprises (SMEs) can also be 
especially vulnerable to disruptions 
to their supply chain and essential 
services, particularly if they have not 
planned ahead (Grow Wellington Ltd, 
2011). Over the last year, WREMO has 
run free business continuity planning 

workshops attended by 120 Wellington 
businesses. However, this is only a 
fraction of all businesses in Wellington 
– among many SMEs there is still 
limited understanding and uptake of 
business continuity planning.
But building Wellington’s economic 
resilience is not just about being 
prepared for disruptive events – it 
also means better understanding 

what segments of our economy 
will grow and provide future 
employment. An important element 
of this work will be partnering with 
our educational institutions and 
the private sector to ensure we have 
the right mix of skills for future 
industries. This will mean providing 
opportunities for workers to retrain 
and upskill for the jobs of the future.

Over recent years, Wellington 

has experienced significant 
growth in the numbers of people 

working, living and playing in the 
central city. This has helped enhance 
Wellington’s compact urban form, with 
more people living close to where they 
work, with easy access to essential 
services and little need to own a car. 
A major challenge will be continuing 
to provide access to quality services as 
the residential population of the central 
city more than doubles by 2043.
As home to New 
Zealand’s Parliament 
and Government, 
higher skilled services 
and public governance 
services contribute about two-thirds 
of Wellington City’s GDP. This leaves 
us vulnerable to disruptive events such 
as earthquakes and terrorist attacks. 
As large tracts of the central city are also 
vulnerable to inundation in a future 
affected by sea level rise, there is a strong 
case to be made for spreading the risk 
by strengthening our central city at the 
same time as other commercial centres.

Our central city currently provides
77%
48%

of total GDP for Wellington City

for the Wellington region

8% of national GDP

(Infometrics, 2015a)

A significant earthquake in Wellington could result in New Zealand 

losing about 1-2% of its current GDP per year.

Lead
WCC
New regional project
We will reduce the vulnerability of the central city and improve the capacity of 
outside hubs to carry out more economic activity.

Action
The Council, in partnership with other councils, business and community groups, 
will assess the economic resilience of the central city, Karori, Johnsonville, Tawa, 
Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt and Porirua. The product will be a set of recommendations 
on how to reduce vulnerability in the central city and generate economic 
opportunities in the hubs.

Resilience co-benefits
The central city is both the most productive and the most vulnerable part of 
Wellington. This project sets out to involve interested parties in a structured way, 
ensuring inclusiveness with broad consultation and communication; and learning 
from the positives and negatives from Wellington’s story so far, as well as from 
Christchurch and overseas (Project 18).
The project will improve Wellington’s resilience to major disasters by building 
economic redundancy throughout the region, but it will also generate an 
opportunity to diversify our economy and prepare it for future demands and 
a changing workforce (Projects 8, 5, 10).

The central city is both the most productive and the most 
vulnerable part of Wellington. This project aims to build 
economic redundancy targeting new areas and new industries.

Help improve

continuity 
planning

Key partners
WCC, WREMO

Lead
Chambers of Commerce
Scaling up existing regional project
We will improve the level of business continuity planning by small-to-medium 
enterprises (SMEs) in Wellington.

Action
Currently, around 100 SMEs per annum participate in the existing WREMO 
business continuity programme. At little or no cost to businesses, this project 
aims to improve the reach of the existing WREMO programme by enlisting the 
support of other agencies, such as the Chambers of Commerce, the Wellington 
Region Economic Development Agency and the Earthquake Commission, to 
promote the programme and other opportunities for planning, with a view to 
1,000 SMEs per annum participating.  The intent is to develop an SME culture 
where continuity planning, including insurance, even at a rudimentary level, is 
part of normal business in Wellington.  The mode of delivery will be active, with 
positive engagement on business locations, as well as the current offering.

Resilience co-benefits
Wellington’s business community will be better prepared to face shocks and 
quickly resume operations following a major disruptive event, such as an 
earthquake. This will help keep Wellington’s economy ticking over, as well as 
provide Wellingtonians with access to the services they need.
Business continuity planning will also help SMEs reduce the impact of minor 
disruptive events (such as equipment failures). The benefits also go beyond 
preparedness – business continuity planning requires organisations to examine 
their business process, which can identify opportunities to make operational 
improvements that increase overall competitiveness and efficiency as well 
as engagement within the business. This also relates to recovery planning 
(Project 18), connective capacity for working from home (Project 23) and 

insurance literacy (Project 21).

In a disaster it is critical that SMEs can quickly resume their 
operations. By investing to resilience SMEs will also improve 
their competitiveness and efficiency.

We recognise a resilience challenge for Wellington in relation to changing 
workforce requirements. The future economy will need different skills and we 
need to adapt to it. We will undertake a study to better understand this challenge 
and how we can respond to it. This will include an analysis of short to medium-
term economic predictions, the offerings of existing tertiary learning institutions 
throughout the region, and how existing resources can be better harnessed to 
capitalise on future opportunities.

Resilience co-benefits
Changes in the economy and the way products and services are developed 
are transforming the way we work. This project aims to reduce Wellington’s 
overreliance on government services and allow the city to take opportunities to 
diversify the economy. There are clear links with our work on ageing population 
(Project 2) and economic hubs outside of central city (Project 8).

The future economy will 
need different skills and 
we need to adapt to it.

Programme 2.1 
Governance

We will ensure that resilience is integrated 

into our governance.

Many Wellington organisations 

and institutions are 
implementing programmes 

aimed at improving the resilience 

of the city and region. While it is 
important for grassroots programmes 
to be allowed to flourish without 
unnecessary administrative burdens, 

there is a risk that we will miss 
opportunities for collaboration and 
co-benefits without appropriate 
coordination and governance.

There is a clear business case for investing now to improve 

the resilience of our critical infrastructure.

The seismic strengthening done by Orion Energy, 
a utility provider in Christchurch, is a prime example 
of how good investments pay off.

Approximately

$6 million

was spent before the earthquakes on 

increasing the resilience of their network

which is estimated to have saved Orion

$30-$50 million

in direct asset replacement costs. This does not take into 

account the broader social and economic benefits.

(Kestrel Group Ltd., 2011).

Despite this benefit, our current governance models 
and methods of prioritising investment – which may be 
based on relatively short payback periods – don’t often 
encourage this kind of proactive approach. 
Prioritisation will be different for each asset, and we 
will need to consider how different assets depend 
on each other. For energy, this requires strategic 
engagement with the Government regarding the 
regulatory framework, supported by economic analysis. 
For transport and water, asset owners need to be 
explicitly aware of the costs and risks of investing in 
resilience, and the costs and risks to the community if 
choosing not to invest. Ultimately, it is communities 
that will pay for resilient infrastructure, and they 
must be able to make conscious choices with the best 
information available.

The expected growth in our 

central city will require 
innovative thinking around 

service provision. Achieving this will 
also require innovative governance 
– rather than thinking first about 

infrastructure, we will need to support 
businesses and retailers in talking 
directly with communities. This 
will help them to better understand 
the vulnerability of services and 
infrastructure that is needed in mainly 

apartment-based living, and a service-
based economy, as well as coordinate 
the physical risk management activities 
of Wellington utility and transport 
service providers.  

Wellington Lifelines Group 
(WeLG) brings together 
in-depth technical 
knowledge of the risks 
and management of of 
Wellington’s key assets. 
The challenge is to 
use this knowledge to 
stimulate effective action.

Following a major shock, we 
need to ensure the basic needs of 
Wellingtonians can be met. The best 
time to do this is before a shock rather 
than during or following an event.
Convincing communities to invest can 
be difficult when there is no immediate 
need. If investment in resilience 
can somehow improve people’s daily 
lives, then this becomes easier.
Combining traditional infrastructure 
solutions with decentralised and natural 
approaches will require new skills and 
take time, meaning our current lifelines 
remain extremely important. Thinking 
about resilience during the planning, 
construction and operation of our key 
infrastructure assets and other future 
projects provides an opportunity to 
achieve more balanced outcomes. By 
taking a more inclusive and integrated 
approach aimed at understanding the 
specific needs of end users, we can better 
prioritise future investment in assets 
and recovery planning. For example, 
an electric fleet of buses could be used 
as mobile generators in an emergency.

Introduce regulatory 
tools (including 
enforcement) for 
resilience 

Lead
WCC
New Wellington City project
We will assess regulatory options to mitigate future liabilities of liquefaction, flooding, 
sea level rise and other hazards, and to build resilience into our city’s decision making.

Action
The Council will assess possible regulatory responses to improve resilience to 
the impacts of sea level rise, earthquake, liquefaction, and tsunami, including 
options to amend land use through the District Plan, building regulation and non-
regulatory options to require residents to secure their homes (including chimneys, 
joists and verandahs), and emergency water storage requirements. Options for 
supporting wider resilience through regulation will also be explored. The project 
will include assessment of the economic impact of regulating and not regulating.

Resilience co-benefits
This project seeks to reflect on the lessons learned from the Christchurch 
earthquakes and make sure they inform Wellington’s planning. It will prepare 
the city for both response to and recovery from natural disasters (Project 18), 
but will also ensure the city continues to learn and innovate during quiet times 
(Project 5, 20, 24).

Wellington City has a number of regulatory tools 
at its disposal. We need to use them well. 

Key partners
Wellington City, Porirua, Lower Hutt councils

Lead
Wellington Lifelines Group
Existing regional project
In partnership with the Wellington Lifelines Group (WeLG), we will better 
communicate the vulnerabilities of our city’s lifelines to leaders and decision 
makers in order to prompt and prioritise action.

Action
WeLG will coordinate a programme to ensure asset owners are making 
Wellington’s decision makers aware of the effect on communities of vulnerabilities 
in lifelines (power, water, telecommunications and transport in particular), and 
that the interdependencies of these lifelines is a key focus. This programme will 
centre on what is required to ensure community needs (such as clean water, 
sanitation, energy, and communications) are met under all circumstances, which 
will then inform decision making about infrastructure.
The programme will bring Transpower, WWL, WE* and NZTA together with 
Wellington, Porirua and Lower Hutt councils to assess the vulnerabilities 
associated with local authorities in our region.
The programme will also include analysis of all Wellington infrastructure to 
provide a clear understanding of the benefits and costs of investing and failing 
to invest appropriately. It is expected the existing Measuring the Economics 
of Resilient Infrastructure (MERIT) tool will be used as it is well understood 
by Treasury, who will be a key player in future investment decisions, but other 
approaches will also be investigated.

Resilience co-benefits
This project will help set expectations for decisions makers, while strengthening 
key relationships with partners. It will help to communicate the risks of living 
in Wellington and lead to formal commitment from key players. More reflective 
collaboration and action will in turn lead to more resilient approaches to meeting 
community needs, including more robust networks. This will result in water, 
energy, telecommunication and transport services able to withstand significant 
shocks while enabling communities and economy to thrive every day.
The Resilient Wellington initiative has revealed that we do not fully understand 
the likely economic impacts of a major shock to Wellington. Results from the 
MERIT study would greatly enhance our understanding of where to focus 
investment to maximise benefits for disaster resilience. The analysis will also 
outline the costs and consequences of inaction and failure to invest in resilient 
homes and infrastructure. WLG will be an essential partner in the recovery 
planning (Project 18).

Maintain 
monitoring and 
evaluation of 
resilience goals

We will maintain momentum 
generated in the strategy 
phase to empower various 
stakeholders to build 
resilience into their projects, 
facilitating ongoing learning 
and collaboration with the 
100RC network.

Key partners
Resilient Wellington Steering Group

Lead
WCC
New Wellington City project
We will maintain the momentum generated by the strategy development process 
through a formal governance structure to oversee the implementation and review 
of the strategy.

Action
The Resilient Wellington Steering Group brought together for the development 
of this strategy will remain in place to oversee strategy implementation and to 
coordinate resilience efforts across the city. 
Steering Group members will be expected to contribute to robust and constructive 
discussion to ensure implementation of the strategy is a success. They will 
consider the progress of each project in regards to timeliness, budget, outcomes 
and barriers to implementation. Members will also have a public role, acting as 
champions of Wellington’s resilience and celebrating key achievements with 
the community and media. The Steering Group is expected to formally report 
to the Wellington City, Lower Hutt and Porirua councils annually in February. 
We will link the project to other Wellington governance bodies such as the Joint 
Committee and the Coordinating Executive Group to ensure integration, good 
governance and strategic overview.
In 2019 the Steering Group will be asked to make recommendations on 
improvements to the strategy to the Council, including recommendations 
for adding or removing projects, objectives, shocks and stresses, and other 
recommendations as members see fit. This is an opportunity to revise the 
strategy’s approach in light of progress and changes to the local, regional, national 
and international situation.
The Chief Resilience Officer will manage the implementation of the strategy as set 
out in the Implementation Plan. This will maintain momentum generated in the 
strategy phase and empower various stakeholders to build resilience into their 
projects, facilitating ongoing learning and collaboration with the 100RC network.

Resilience co-benefits
The Resilient Wellington Steering Group acting as Wellington resilience champions 
will ensure the strategy is implemented in an efficient and collaborative way, and 
will ensure that resilience efforts continue in the future.
This project will hold key people to account for the resilience tasks they have 

been allocated. This in turn will provide elected officials and others with the 

assurance and transparency required for good governance.

New York City

Inspiration from the 100RC network  
– New York Rebuild By Design
Following Superstorm Sandy, the city of New York realised that a shift in thinking was 
required. A shift away from simply responding to disasters, and towards investing in 
planning, preparing and designing the City to deal with the disruptions that will be 
part of the next century.
The Rockefeller Foundation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
used the Rebuild By Design competition to achieve a collaborative approach to build 
resilience into future New York. The process ocussed strongly and deliberately 
on collaboration, engagement and understanding challenges before starting to 
contemplate potential solutions. This avoided the temptation to leap to conclusions, 
and ensured the groundwork was properly completed.
The approach was a popular success, and Rebuild By Design is now its own 
organisation, using its design approach to help cities to invest before disasters strike. 
Mexico City, San Francisco, Rotterdam and others now use the approach for specific 
planning challenges in their own environments, using ecological and landscape design 
techniques to address climate related challenges.
As Wellington works to understand and respond to vulnerabilities like sea level rise and 
flooding, we will take heed of Rebuild By Design’s collaborative and visionary approach.
Wellington is not in the business of waiting for disasters and responding to them. Like 
Rebuild By Design, Wellington is in the business of coming together with communities 
to invest in smart interventions that benefit people – today and tomorrow.

Information

We will make information on all aspects 
of living in Wellington easily accessible.

We hold tremendous amounts 

of data about our city, 
but despite this, most 

Wellingtonians still find it hard to access 
reliable and easy-to-use information 
to inform key life decisions, such as 
the earthquake and climate risks of a 
property they are interested in. This 
sometimes means Wellingtonians make 
decisions that place them at heightened 
risk from disruptive events, which 
increases the burden on government 
and community organisations to provide 
support if this happens.

We have some difficult decisions to 
make, like the future of our coastal 
properties. We need to improve how 
we bring our economic, demographic, 
scientific and other information 
together to inform decision making 
and future investments. A key part 
of this will be using more open-
source approaches that empower 
our residents to make well-informed 
decisions of their own.

As a knowledgeable and creative city, 
we also have the resources at our 
disposal to build our resilience in more 
innovative ways. We can combine 
these strengths to cater for a range 
of different audiences and learning 
styles. For example, creating virtual 
reality environments to help visualise 
the impacts of natural hazards and 
collaborate on solutions, or devising 
art installations, films and events that 
encourage creativity and steer action 
around adaptation and preparedness.

Mexico City

Inspiration from 100RC network  
– The Great Model in Mexico
Mexico City is developing an interactive city model, La Gran Maqueta de la Ciudad 
de México, which represents a technological leap toward sustainable urban planning 
for the city. The model allows experts, citizens and the private sector to have a visual 
and manageable representation of city data, past and present. “The Great Model” is 
accompanied by a technological display that explores the complexity of the Mexican 
capital, its origins, its emotions and its urban evolution. There are also multimedia 
installations, most of which are interactive and participative; a consultation room; 
a large format audio-visual installation; the latest generation touch screens; maps; 
plans; and hundreds of photographs, giving visitors an experience for all the senses. 
Mexico City is the only city in the country to be a member of C40, so alongside the 
100 Resilient Cities programme, they are ahead of the majority with the formation 
of databases and high regulatory benchmarks aligned to international standards.

Give Wellingtonians 
information they 
need to make 
decisions

Key partners
NEC

Lead
WCC
Existing Wellington City project
We will bring together a wide range of data on Wellington and make it available 
so that citizens, researchers, investors and visitors can use it to make their own 
decisions and plans.

15
Develop a virtual 
reality model of the 
central city built 
environment

Action
Working closely with end users and partners, the Council will develop an 
online information hub to connect citizens with available information about all 
aspects of living in Wellington. In the first instance this will involve developing 
an intelligence system to support post-earthquake building inspections – this 
will draw on emerging sensor technology to better inform decision making.  
The hub will also include information around hazards such as sea level rise, 
liquefaction, tsunami, ground shaking, as well as opportunities like volunteering, 
social support, funding and shared community resources. This will be a 
virtual collaboration space building on and connecting existing services like 
#wellynextdoor, Neighbourly and the Community Resilience Map. It will be based 
on open source data and informed by real-time sensors around the city.
The hub will be robust and designed to be accessible during a major shock event.

Resilience co-benefits
The project enables responders, citizens, researchers, investors and visitors to 
better participate in decision making. While the project will enable people to 
better understand the types of natural disasters they might encounter (Project 
18), it will also provide for more engaged and connected communities (Project 4). 
People will be able to make their own decisions in light of the available data.

Key partners
NEC

Lead
WCC
New Wellington City project
We will develop a model of Wellington’s central city that uses 3D, virtual reality 
(VR) and augmented reality (AR) techniques to better communicate information 
about Wellington and its hazards.

Action
Technology plays an increasingly important role in how Wellingtonians 
communicate and engage with information. We have an opportunity to draw on 
our gaming and tech sectors to improve awareness of Wellington’s hazards by 
developing a 3D/VR model of the central city and simulations of how it could be 
affected by events such as earthquakes and sea level rise. This could be used by 
emergency management agencies and first responders, as well as the general public.

Resilience co-benefits
This project will increase awareness and preparedness among groups in 
Wellington that may otherwise be unprepared (Project 18), as well as continuing 
to build capacity within our technology and academic sectors (Project 10). It will 
also be a mechanism for further public conversations and engagement across 
levels of government.

We will draw on our gaming and tech 
sectors to inspire action on resilience.

Adaptation

We will raise awareness about the potential effects 
of climate change and sea level rise, and develop 
an adaptation plan that emphasises the need for 

future decisions to be made.

However, this won’t be easy. In 

a city where most people live 
within three kilometres of the 

coastline, we face some challenging 
discussions about future land use. 
One of the most difficult aspects 
of rising sea levels is the impact on 
people’s homes, which for many are 
not just their homes but also their 
financial security now and for their 
grandchildren. While coastal property 
owners are increasingly seeking to 
protect their property, some measures 

may conflict with the wider public and 
environmental values of preserving 
natural coastal character, amenity, 
and public access. There is also a wider 
community conflict of who pays, and 
who gets to make decisions.
In Wellington we have an opportunity 
with National Institute of Water and 
Atmospheric Research (NIWA) to develop 
a participatory approach to discussions 
with coastal communities about coastal 
adapation issues, including supporting 
tools and information.

Our Māori communities have been 
here the longest; they have recovered 
from more shocks and stresses than 
most, and have evolved a network 
and knowledge that is pivotal for 
Wellington’s resilience. The concept 
of kaitiakitanga4, guardianship 
of the natural environment, will 
remain prominent.

A truly forward-looking resilience strategy must spare more than a thought 
for our Pacific Island neighbours such as Cook Islands, Tokelau and Niue. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified these small 
island states as being the most vulnerable countries in terms of adverse climate 
change impacts. Not only are we geographically close to many of these nations, 
but we share strong cultural ties. Today, eight percent of Wellington’s population 
is Pasifika – many of these Wellingtonians have people they know and love who 
will look to them for support in a future affected by rising sea levels. 
(Profile.id, 2016b).

Climate change presents some 

extremely difficult decisions 
around the future of existing 

infrastructure. As we operate, 
maintain and rebuild our assets,  

we have an opportunity to build 
resilience qualities, including 
preparedness for climate change 
and earthquakes, into much of the 
infrastructure that will service 

Wellingtonians for decades to come. 
Achieving this requires climate 
adaptation to be embedded into the 
decision making of our governments, 
utilities and businesses.

In partnership with Central Government and aid agencies, we will need to be prepared for a likely future where a 
large number of climate refugees seek new homes in our region. This means ensuring we can continue to meet the 
needs of our residents while also meeting international obligations and maintaining Wellington’s reputation as a 
welcoming and compassionate city. This means providing adequate support services to allow new arrivals to flourish 
and contribute meaningfully, such as English language lessons and vocational training.

The project will prepare us for 
difficult decisions concerning 
sea level rise.

Key partners
Hutt City Council

Lead
WCC
New Wellington City project
We will raise awareness among coastal communities about the potential effects of 
sea level rise to better emphasise the need for decisions to be made in this area and 
prepare ground for the future Adaptation Plan.

Action
This project is a preliminary step to prepare communities for the likelihood that 
decisions will need to be taken in the future to adapt to the effect of changing sea 
levels and behaviours. 
We will talk with coastal communities to decide how we will plan for sea level 
rise. Engagement could be through a series of formally constituted community 
representative groups/panels, including elected officials, iwi, schools and other 
educational facilities to co-design approaches for dealing with sea level rise. 
The project will look for ways to preserve our natural coastal environment and its 
ecosystem services.

Resilience co-benefits
The project will start conversations with communities about climate change and 
especially sea level rise to make the process of developing our Adaptation Plan 
more inclusive and reflective (using good experiences from our other community 
resilience work – Project 4).
The project will maximise the use of natural infrastructure to protect the coast 
from storm damage and preserve our beaches and dunes, which are essential to 
Wellington’s quality of life (Project 24).

Existing Wellington City project
We will encourage action on climate adaptation by providing funding for 
innovative projects and increasing awareness of the issues.

Action
We will work with the education, arts and sports sectors to develop new, creative 
and engaging ways of communicating about climate change and take every 
opportunity to communicate about sea level rise.
We will also modify the Low Carbon Challenge to include climate change 
adaptation initiatives that promote environmental restoration and community 
cohesion. Finally, we will introduce a Wellington climate change adaptation fund 
to help cover the future costs of infrastructure redevelopment and other works 
required to deal with the effects of sea level rise.  
We will work with climate entrepreneurs in other 100RC cities such as New 
Orleans, New York and Rotterdam to forge new links and inspire new ideas. 

Resilience co-benefits
By using co-design principles and allocating funding to grassroots initiatives we 
will generate an opportunity to build stronger and more engaged communities 
(Project 4) by empowering people to make informed decisions about their future.

By collaborating with people around the world, using co-design principles, 
and allocating funding to grassroots initiatives we will turn climate threat 
into an opportunity.

100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyProgramme 2.4 
Recovery 

We will develop a framework for successful 

recovery from any disruption.

While the Wellington region 

includes eight Territorial 
Authorities (TAs) and a 

regional authority – each with its own 
jurisdiction – our cities and districts 
are inseparable. Many of us live in one 
city or district and work in another, 
and much of our critical infrastructure 
serves multiple parts of the region. 
Large-scale shock events – such as big 
earthquakes, water contamination 
incidents or major storms – have no 
regard for jurisdictional boundaries. 
One issue we already know to be a 
challenge for our recovery across 

the Wellington region is temporary 
housing. We lack good information on 
what percentage of homes would be 
uninhabitable in the event of a major 
natural disaster, although the number 
is expected to be significant.
At present, the Wellington region 
has limited arrangements and plans 
in place to deal with regional scale 
coordination after a major shock 
event felt across the region. The 
Kaikoura earthquake tested those 
systems and we now have a better 
idea of what is needed. By having 

tough discussions now about post-
event leadership and governance, 
we can strengthen partnerships 
and improve coordination for when 
disaster strikes, as well as building 
more cohesive communities in good 
times. This will need to include all TAs 
in our region, Central Government, 
lifelines, private sector organisations, 
and communities themselves. This 
increased coordination may also help 
find solutions to other problems, such 
as growing inequality and housing 
affordability constraints.

Christchurch

Inspiration from 100RC network  
– Learning from our sibling, Christchurch
As Christchurch has recovered from the trauma of the earthquakes, people have rightly 
been focussed on future promise rather than past trauma. For Wellington, that past 
contains some valuable pieces of information given the seismic profile of the capital, 
and given the Kaikoura earthquake experience. While Wellington and Christchurch 
do not share exactly the same geography, they have similar governance and decision-
making environments, infrastructure networks and cultures.
The 100RC network has given Wellington extra impetus and resource to allow the 
lessons from Christchurch and Kaikoura, good and bad, to be considered and, where 
appropriate, included in Wellington’s planning and business.
We are working closely with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the 
Canterbury Earthquake Recovery entities, analysing information around governance, 
collaboration with Central Government, effects of liquefaction and vulnerability of 
centralised infrastructure. Some of the examples especially relevant for Wellington 
include the following.
•  Recovery planning: Clear recovery expectations, roles and responsibilities are 

often discussed but rarely actioned. There is no reason not to plan for post-shock 
Wellington and to be open about who will be expected to do what. 

•  Focus on small business: Generally, corporates can take care of themselves. But 

SMEs are a large part of Wellington’s economy. There are some simple things SMEs 
could have done in Christchurch to reduce the trauma. Wellington SMEs have the 
opportunity to do these things pre-event.

•  Your home is your castle: Without a safe haven, people are emotionally vulnerable. 

There are simple things we can do in our homes so they can be the social, 
emotional and economic mainstay of our personal and collective resilience.

Wellington region

Lead
WREMO 
 

Key partners
Wellington, Hutt and Porirua councils, 
Wellington Chamber of Commerce, Wellington 
Regional Economic Development Agency

New regional project
We will develop a Pre-disaster Recovery Framework and facilitated process to 
guide post-event decision making.

Action
WREMO will develop a recovery framework addressing all types of shocks and 
stresses to “prepare the region to partner” by addressing the varied interests of 
local councils, the region as a whole, the private and community sectors as well 
as central government. The framework will be developed to inform resilience 
investments across the built, social, economic, natural and cultural environments. 
We will facilitate a planning process with key stakeholders in the private, 
community and government sectors to develop a shared recovery vision and 
provide greater clarity of governance arrangements, roles and responsibilities, 
decision-making frameworks and clear linkages to resilience related investments. 
Ultimately, it will aim to create the right conditions for a positive recovery by 
preparing the region’s many diverse stakeholders to partner effectively through a 
shared recovery framework. 
The framework will embody the lessons learned from the Kaikoura and Canterbury 
earthquakes. We will explore the balance of life safety and earthquake damage. 
The project will link closely to other resilience projects such as Wellington 
Lifelines (Project 12) and Info Hub (Project 14).

While preparing the city for 
recovery from a major disaster, 
this planning process will also 
help strengthen relationships 
between key stakeholders.

Resilience co-benefits
The planning process will help to communicate the risks of living in Wellington 
and get formal commitment from key players that would be needed to work 
towards a shared recovery vision in a post-event environment. While preparing 
the city for recovery from a major disaster, this planning process will also help 
strengthen relationships between key stakeholders. It will allow us to continue 
mitigating risks and improve Wellington’s resilience to ongoing stresses.

Carry out post-
earthquake 
housing study

Key partners
Wellington, Hutt and Porirua councils

Lead
WREMO
New regional project
We will undertake a study to understand the constraints and opportunities for 
providing shelter and housing through the response and recovery phases after 
a significant seismic event or other shock affecting property.

Action
WREMO will undertake a temporary housing study to understand options for 
emergency response and recovery planning. It will address emergency and 
transitional shelter options, temporary housing options, live-in-place and repair 
options, alternative uses for existing open spaces, as well as potential finance 
assistance models for housing recovery. This project will examine options for 
various earthquake and flooding scenarios where temporary accommodation 
might be required, and will outline any gaps in capacity, with recommendations 
for how this might be addressed.

Resilience co-benefits
This project will provide decision-makers with a clearer understanding of the 
capacity and capability for temporary accommodation, enabling this to be built 
into response and recovery planning (Project 18). While this is primarily focussed 
on earthquakes, as these are most likely to require large-scale temporary housing, 
the outcomes of this project could apply to other shocks as well. A co-benefit of 
this study will be identifying possible sources of temporary accommodation that 
could assist with the ongoing challenge of homelessness (Project 2) or temporary 
housing for climate refugees (Project 16).

While largely focussed 
on earthquake response, 
this study could assist 
with homelessness and 
temporary housing 
for refugees.

Access to safe, warm, affordable and physically robust housing is a basic 
human right. Providing this for all Wellingtonians will boost quality of life 
across our city, supporting better health and education, particularly among 
our most vulnerable. Our homes will be supported by the right mix of assets 
and infrastructure – one in which natural and built assets work together in 
the face of a changing climate to sustainably meet Wellingtonians’ basic 
needs, such as clean air, safe drinking water and energy.

Programme 3.1 
Homes and telecommunication

We will support initiatives that contribute to 
Wellington homes forming the cornerstone  

of the city’s resilience.

Safe, warm housing is a basic 

human need, but meeting 
this need can be expensive in 

Wellington. Nationally, New Zealanders 
spend around 23 percent of their gross 
disposable income on housing (seventh 
among OECD countries – OECD, 2015), 
while in Wellington City housing is 
considered severely unaffordable 
due to median prices approaching six 
times the median household income. 
It is estimated the city will need an 
additional 21,400 houses by 2043 to 
meet demand (WCC, 2015b).
Despite the high prices, the standard 
of housing for many Wellingtonians is 
inadequate. Wellington’s hilly terrain 
means some areas do not receive much 

sun, and housing can be cold, damp 
and prone to mould and borer. It is 
well documented that poor quality 
housing drives significant health 
and energy costs across the country, 
although the scale of the problem is 
not well understood in Wellington. 
The greatest concerns about housing 
quality are most often about rental 
properties, which are the homes of our 
most vulnerable citizens including 
immigrants, students and young 
families. In many cases these homes are 
also the least resilient to earthquakes.
Improving the quality of these 
homes will not be cheap, and 
limited insurance literacy means 
that restoring homes following 

a major shock event may prove 
difficult for many. This stems from 
recent changes to house insurance, 
where only a fixed sum is insured, 
rather than the total replacement 
cost. The result is that many 
Wellingtonians may not have 
sufficient cover to resume the same 
standard of living following a shock 
like a major earthquake. In addition, 
research by Massey University (2013) 
found that only 21 percent of New 
Zealanders had income protection 
or disability insurance, meaning 
most would have limited income if 
a major shock disrupted their place 
of employment.

O ur homes should be spaces 

to feel safe and recover 
following a major seismic 

event, but at the moment many 
cannot serve this function. The 
central city could be compromised 

and people might need to work from 
home at a large scale. At this point, 
we are not sure if our homes and 
telecommunications networks can 
support this.

The Mayoral Taskforce on Housing 
acknowledges our future challenges – 
as does the Future Central City project. 
These initiatives complement the 
Resilience Strategy and will be linked 
through the Resilience Steering Group.

If the central city was significantly 
damaged in a major shock event

people would need to work 

from another location.

for many of them, working from 
home is the next best option.

Help make homes 
warm, safe and dry

Lead
WREMO 

Key partners
BRANZ, Earthquake Commission, 
insurance sector

New Wellington City project
We will investigate options to improve the resilience of Wellington’s new and 
existing housing stock so that homes can better withstand earthquakes and 
storms, and can be used post-event as workplaces.

Action
The Council will lead two work streams: new homes and existing homes.
We will investigate regulatory and non-regulatory options for improving the 
resilience of new homes. This will include the potential requirement for new 
homes to be constructed with emergency water tanks, collection of grey water, 
solar panels and for multi-unit buildings to have “connected” or “bumping” spaces 
where people can meet and work together.    
We will also investigate regulatory and non-regulatory options and tools 
for existing homes. This will include the potential requirement for subfloor, 
foundation and roof bracing within structures to be secure, dry and adequately 
ventilated. In addition we will promote chimneys to be seismically secure 
and undertake analysis of the extent and risk of borer infestations. Existing 
homeowners will also be informed of other co-benefits linked to a variety of 
seismic strengthening options available, which will increase the resilience of 
their home. We will investigate opportunities to link earthquake strengthening 
to interventions improving the health of home environments through ventilation, 
insulation and double glazing. 
Both work streams will work closely with the Mayoral Housing Taskforce. We 
will widely communicate the lessons learned from Christchurch. We will develop 
a housing warrant of fitness for owners to ensure they understand the level of 
maintenance needed to keep homes warm, resilient and dry. We will work with 
banks and insurers to explore incentives for home owners. This project will 
enable the Council to better evaluate the risk to the city of doing nothing. More 
widely, it will also improve guidance for working on older homes and develop 
training models on home renovations through the Building and Construction 
Industry Training Organisation.
This project is closely connected to the telecommunication sector assessment 
to enable large-scale working from home (Project 23) and improving access to 
household resilience items (Project 1). 

Resilience co-benefits
The project will give home owners, tenants, insurers and planners confidence 
that housing stock can withstand a moderate level earthquake so that people can 
remain in their homes, and possibly work from home in the event that commercial 
buildings are compromised (Projects 18, 19, 23).
Improving the quality of our homes – making them warmer, safer and healthier 
– can also generate benefits in terms of productivity and education, becoming 
spaces where people can build their personal resilience to any shocks or stresses 
(Projects 1, 2). The project will also strengthen communities by providing an 
opportunity to design resilience into shared spaces (Project 5).

Our homes should be the 
cornerstone of our resilience.

Lead
WCC 

Key partners
Insurance Council of New Zealand, 
Earthquake Commission (EQC), banks

New regional project
We will support home, business and asset owners to make informed decisions 
about their insurance cover. 

Action
The Insurance Council of New Zealand (ICNZ) will conduct a survey to test 
the level of knowledge about insurance and better understand the social 
consequences of underinsurance. We will also assess people’s ability to access 
insurance. Depending on survey results, ICNZ will undertake a targeted campaign 
to make home and asset owners aware of the gap between assumption and reality, 
with advice on where to find out more information, and what to consider when 
calculating the right level of insurance cover.

Resilience co-benefits
Reflecting on Canterbury, better information about insurance will allow systems 
to be integrated with response, recovery and risk reduction planning. It will open 
doors to debate on other tools to build resilience into Wellington’s homes. EQC will 
be able to better communicate its role and responsibilities.
It is also an opportunity to engage with communities, and to connect them to 
key information and knowledge so they can make better decisions. Home owners 
will have a more realistic understanding of their liability 
and responsibility, and will make sure they have the right 
level of insurance. This work will support the objectives 
relating to home resilience (Project 20) and business 
resilience (Project 9).

Talking about insurance is an opportunity to give home 
owners more realistic understanding of their liabilities.

New Orleans

Inspiration from 100RC network  
– Warm, safe and dry homes in New Orleans
We know that Wellington’s homes leave a lot to be desired. We can deal with new 
homes through regulations, but most of our homes are already built, and are very 
difficult and expensive to retrofit to make warm, dry and safe to natural hazards. 
Typically, the people who are most vulnerable in their homes are those who can least 
afford to do anything about it.
Through its Resilience Strategy, New Orleans has developed ways to encourage and 
support home owners in vulnerable areas to modify their homes to the effects of 
flooding. In particular, we noted the financial incentives and levers New Orleans has 
successfully implemented to change home owners’ behaviours, and we are keen to 
explore similar options to achieve warmer, drier and safer homes in Wellington.

Key partners
Ministry of Business Innovation and

New Wellington City project
We will undertake a study of Wellington homes to assess the risk of water ingress 
in our new and existing housing leading to health issues resulting from cold, 
dampness and mould.

Action
The Council will undertake a targeted analysis to determine the scale of 
weathertightness issues in Wellington’s housing stock. The project report will 
provide recommendations or actions required for home improvements, and 
be accompanied by guidance developed for home owners; promoting regular 
maintenance, adequate insulation and ventilation and outlining options for 
cost-effective repairs.
The project will provide information to support discussions with central 
government and the building sector to address this issue. It will also support a 
balanced public debate and provide an opportunity to talk with communities and 
offer them key information to make better decisions.

Resilience co-benefits
The project will improve the Council’s understanding of the scale of the problem. 
This will enable decisions to be made around what, if any, action is required 
to ensure these homes can withstand future shocks from seismic and extreme 
weather events. Warmer and drier homes lead to better health and comfort 
for the occupants, improving their chances in regards to social, educational 
and economic outcomes. The outcomes of this project will inform our work on 
resilient homes (Project 20).

WCC
New regional project
We will assess the telecommunications sector’s capability to support high 
numbers of people working from home after a seismic event or other significant 
shock. This initiative is undertaken in conjunction with Project 5 – supporting 
community spaces for wellbeing and post-disaster roles.

Action
WCC and other councils will work with the asset owners to assess the 
telecommunications sector’s ability to support remote working for a large number of 
Wellingtonians over a prolonged period, based on a common understanding of levels 
of service. The assessment will make recommendations on any gaps identified.

Resilience co-benefits
This project will help us understand the gaps we need to fill to ensure a large 
percentage of Wellington’s workforce and economy can continue operating after 
a major shock. At the same time, this work could also see a reduced need for 
travel and encourage more flexibility in ways of working, even when not faced 
with a disruptive event. This could benefit employers and employees, potentially 
reducing an existing barrier to workforce participation; for example, by enabling 
more part-time work by those caring for children or returning from maternity 
leave, as well as older people or those with mobility constraints. This project 
is related to promotion of new economic hubs (Project 8) and development of 
community spaces for post-disaster roles (Project 5) and has relevance to work 
with ageing population (Project 3).

Well-connected homes provide more 
flexibility during disruptions and are 
more inclusive for people who can’t 
or don’t want to travel to work.

It is estimated that in the event of a 

significant earthquake, water supply 
in Wellington will not be restored for 

up to 70 days in some locations. Most 
Wellingtonians only store water for 3 days. 
Rainwater collection could significantly 
improve levels of self-sufficiency, but very 
few houses are equipped for this. This also 
represents a missed opportunity to future-
proof our water supply from threats that 
may seem remote today, but could arise in 
an uncertain future, such as droughts.

Population growth will put further 
pressure on our wastewater 
infrastructure, which is already at 
capacity, posing a risk for human health 
and the environment. Wellingtonians 
are not prepared to manage their 
wastewater without reticulated 
wastewater infrastructure. Any disaster 
is likely to be compounded by health 
risks related to contamination of public 
spaces with untreated sewage.

Climate change is expected to bring 
more intense rainfall, which will put 
additional stress on our highly modified 
(by culverts, for example) urban 
water systems. Urban intensification 
in response to population growth in 
our city is also generating demand 
for available land, placing increased 
pressure on our natural assets, while 
increasing demand for fresh water and 
generating more wastewater and runoff.

We depend on a healthy natural 

environment to provide a 
range of benefits known 
collectively as “ecosystem services”, 
which include water and air purification, 
recreation and wellbeing, and pollination. 
The biodiversity that contributes to these 
services exists in our reserves, parks, 
urban gardens, waterways, wetlands 
and coast. While some of this may be 
under increasing pressure, Wellington is 
fortunate to have abundant natural assets.

A key element in the City Resilience 
Framework used across the 100RC 
network is protecting and enhancing 
these natural assets. This is especially 
relevant for adapting to rising sea levels 
and increased storm surges – “soft” 
measures, such as dune nourishment 
and protecting natural kelp beds, can 
be highly effective for dissipating wave 
energy and reducing the extent and 
severity of erosion and inundation. From 
an urban resilience perspective, the 

great advantage of these approaches is 
the opportunity for co-benefits – natural 
defences can provide recreational 
values, generate habitat for indigenous 
biodiversity, and make an area more 
attractive. They may also be combined 
with harder defences to provide flexible 
community spaces and active transport 
corridors along a raised shoreline.

Lead
WCC
New Wellington City project
We will integrate ecological interventions into how we manage Wellington’s water 
system to improve the quality of stormwater entering our streams and coast, 
improve resilience to flash floods and enhance urban biodiversity.

Action
The Council’s urban ecology team will reduce the barriers to the uptake of water 
sensitive urban design (WSUD) by delivering a series of studies and demonstration 
projects in partnership with infrastructure managers and environmental groups.
Specifically, we will assess the costs and benefits of ecologically enhanced 
stormwater systems, investigate alternative financing instruments and map 
existing expertise. We will also develop a large-scale demonstration project in a 
number of hydrologically linked locations in urban settings and bigger open public 
spaces. The project will also include a series of training seminars delivered by 
international experts from The Nature Conservancy and other 100RC cities.

Resilience co-benefits
The project will improve understanding of the feasibility and value case for 
applying ecological interventions in fresh water management, including stream 
daylighting, developing wetlands, and other WSUD such as rain gardens, ponds 
and tanks, permeable pavements, and green walls and roofs. It will provide an 
opportunity for traditional water engineers and landscape designers to collectively 
develop effective, place-based approaches by learning from each other and 
international experts.
Effective WSUD slows down rainwater flow and improves its quality by capturing 
contaminants. As a result, it minimises damage associated with slips and erosion 
and reduces need for water treatment. This type of measure is likely to form part 
of our climate Adaptation Plan (Project 16). In addition, better capture of rainwater 
provides an efficient alternative to expensive infrastructure development and 
reduces impact on water sources in our regional parks. WSUD will also improve 
the quality of urban spaces for our communities (Project 5), enhancing our 
biodiversity and our wellbeing, as well as being increasing our robustness and 
resilience in a seismic event (Project 18).

Working with Platform Partners 
- Conserving nature with The Nature Conservancy
Wellingtonians love nature. As a port city, we especially acknowledge Tangaroa and te 
mana o te wai5. As the city grows and changes, we will need to work hard to retain and 
maybe enhance what we have for future generations.
The Nature Conservancy, one of the 100RC Platform Partners, will be an important 
partner in helping us improve water systems through ecological interventions.
The Nature Conservancy has a wealth of experience in this area, and we have looked 
to the work undertaken with the city of Melbourne in biodiversity to understand the 
strength of this opportunity. We are looking to make better use of Wellington’s natural 
resources through initiatives such as transforming some stormwater pipes into open 
streams, enhancing the city’s biodiversity and  amenity while managing hydraulic flows.

New Wellington City project
We will reduce carbon and landfill liability related to sewage management.

Key partners
Veolia, Wellington Water

Action
The Council will undertake an options assessment for sewage sludge disposal to 
identify preferred options.

Resilience co-benefits
This project directly addresses the stress on infrastructure, and puts in place a 
suite of investment options that mitigate future capacity issues. At the same time, 
the city’s financial exposure to carbon markets will be reduced.
Additionally, a better sludge disposal operation can be linked to energy 
production, making Wellington less dependent on external energy supply. 
Finally, the status quo is not consistent with how Wellington perceives itself 
environmentally. A better disposal option will bring Wellington’s aspirations into 
alignment with what actually happens on the ground.

A city waste disposal system needs to be in line with its environmental aspirations.

Paris

Working with Platform Partners  
– Talking rubbish with Veolia
Wellington aspires to be an eco-city that is a leader in environmental practice. One 
of the biggest differences the city can make is to improve the way we dispose of 
organic waste – currently this makes up the largest proportion of the Council’s carbon 
emissions inventory.
Facilitated by 100RC, Veolia and Wellington Water have come together to examine 
the opportunity to change the current practice, and are developing proposals to 
convert organic waste, and sewage sludge in particular, into energy. This would not 
only solve several complex waste management issues, but also build redundancy into 
Wellington’s vulnerable energy supply chain.
Veolia is one of the 100RC platform partners. It works with hundreds of diverse cities 
around the world on water, energy, and waste management.

for the emergency water supply for Wellington Hospital and implement the project.
The project will investigate synergies related to restoration of existing 
watercourses and irrigation of urban agriculture projects in the neighbourhood.

Resilience co-benefits
This project improves the likelihood that Wellington Hospital will be able to 
function after an earthquake and may also identify water efficiency opportunities 
for the day-to-day operation of the hospital.
The project presents an opportunity to create a new amenity in Newtown, perhaps 
connecting with some of the local streams (Project 24) and providing irrigation for 
the local urban farm (Projects 5 and 6).

Scaling up of existing regional project
We will accelerate investment in water resilience and promote emergency water and 
sewage preparedness options to citizens, businesses and institutions to encourage 
them to take action and be self-sufficient for at least 7 days following a disaster.

Action
Wellington Water will design and implement an accelerated investment 
programme supported by an initiative that reinforces the need for all individuals, 
communities and institutions to take responsibility for their own emergency water 
and sewage. This includes further promotion of household emergency water tanks 
and increased use of grey and rain water. The communication will also aim to grow 
awareness of the sewage disposal challenge if reticulation is unavailable.

Resilience co-benefits
The project will improve Wellington’s ability to cope with a shock, and the 
ability of Wellingtonians to withstand a water and a sewage network outage 
for longer periods of time. This will be beneficial in the immediate response 
during a disaster and recovery minimising health risks and contamination of the 
environment (Project 18).
At the same time, promotion of grey water use and rainwater retention measures 
will reduce demand for water from the mains network, reducing pressure on 
water supply, as well as reducing costs of water treatment and pumping. This will 
also have a beneficial effect for stormwater management (Project 24), slowing 
down the runoff during the flash floods expected as a consequence of climate 
change (Project 16).

100 Resilient CitiesProgramme 3.3 
Transport and energy 

We will work with infrastructure owners to ensure 
flexibility and robustness of transport and energy 

services in Wellington.

The current and future 

prosperity of Wellington relies 
on mobility of people, goods 

and information. Despite higher 
levels of cycling and walking than 
most other parts of New Zealand, 
Wellington remains highly reliant 
on road transportation. Seventy-one 
percent of trips were made by car in 
the Wellington region between 2010 
and 2014, and 70 percent of freight was 
moved by road in 2012.
The way our region’s transport corridor 
is shaped means it can be easily 
disrupted. Around 27% of workers in 
Wellington use it each day, and if it is 
closed, even briefly as it was after the 
Kaikoura earthquake, traffic comes to a 
standstill. Projects like the Transmission 
Gully motorway are important for the 
robustness of our region’s transport 
networks, but we also need to look 
at other approaches for generating 

flexibility and relieving congestion. 
While Wellington Harbour is also 
important for inter-island transport 
between Aotea Quay and Picton, it is 
also the main backup point of entry 
should land access be compromised. 
The Kaikoura earthquake has 
highlighted the fact this is a significant 
vulnerability for Wellington.
Wellington’s public transport continues 
to improve, but it is likely that private 
vehicle travel will remain important in 
Wellington. There is a trend towards 
types of vehicle that are less reliant on 
our vulnerable fuel supply chains and 
also produce fewer emissions. As 82 
percent (MBIE, 2016) of Wellington’s 
electricity comes from renewable 
sources – chiefly from a windfarm 
located within the boundary of 
Wellington City – we are especially well 
positioned for use of electric vehicles.

Wellington’s strong use of renewables 
is a great asset for our ability to cope 
with oil price shocks and breakdown 
in supply chains, but we know that 
our electricity distribution network is 
vulnerable to high winds, earthquake, 
fires and other natural and manmade 
hazards. Most citizens are unaware 
of the high degree of vulnerability, or 
of how reliant our economy is on its 
power supply. While we are currently 
looking to build robustness into the 
physical network, Wellingtonians are 
also increasingly discussing the idea 
of distributed infrastructure such us 
mini hydro, solar and wind generators. 
Distributed generation infrastructure 
builds our ability to cope with fuel and 
power supply disruptions following 
major shocks, and in the future may 
be able to help relieve the pressures on 
households from rising energy costs.

Support flexible 
energy supply

Key partners
Wellington Electricity, Transpower

Lead
WCC
New regional project
We will work with Wellington’s electricity sector to build in redundancy and 
flexibility into our energy supply.

Action
The Council will work with Wellington Electricity and the Commerce Commission 
to make the network less vulnerable and perform to the agreed service levels. 
This will include investigation into incorporating network resilience in price 
setting mechanisms. We will also investigate options for incentivising uptake of 
technology that will build household energy independence, which could include 
microgeneration, battery packs, solar roofs, small-scale wind, tidal energy and 
neighbourhood microgrids.

Resilience co-benefits
The project seeks an energy network that is robust and flexible. A more 
decentralised network that includes multiple small-scale generation sources will 
perform better in an earthquake or a storm (Project 18), and will have an added 
benefit of reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
This approach can also generate economic opportunity, positioning Wellington as 
a leader in alternative technologies and building on our existing reputation as a 
low-carbon city (Projects 8,10).

Support widespread 
adoption of electric 
vehicles

Key partners
Wellington Electricity

Lead
WCC
New Wellington City project
We will enable widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs) in Wellington, reducing 
dependence on the vulnerable fuel supply chain, as well as our carbon footprint.

Action
This project will see the Council lead by example by switching its fleet to EVs as 
they become due for replacement. We will give priority to contractors that use EVs, 
including waste, recycling and street cleaning contractors.
We will support use outside of the Council by investing in charging 
infrastructure across the city, as well as working with other regional councils 
to establish a broader charging network. Uptake of EVs will also be supported 
through the District Plan, particularly in regards to charging infrastructure for 
apartments and new homes.

Resilience co-benefits
A significant increase in electric vehicles will drive reductions in air pollution 
and noise, resulting in health benefits for all Wellingtonians. In the event of a 
major shock that disrupts fuel supply chains, EVs may provide ongoing mobility, 
particularly if they are able to be recharged through renewable and distributed 
sources of energy (Project 28). EV batteries may also be able to provide emergency 
household power sources in the event of a seismic emergency. 
The project will also generate alternative income/business development 
opportunities in the clean technology industry (Project 8 and 10).

A more decentralised network 
that includes multiple small-
scale generation sources 
will perform better in an 
earthquake or a storm, and 
will have an added benefit of 
reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Electric vehicles are better for the environment, 
and in a disaster there are more recharging 
options. Their batteries could supply emergency 

power to households if the lines are down.

New Zealand Transport  
Agency (NZTA) 
Existing Wellington City project
We will work with NZTA to build and maintain resilient transport infrastructure 
for critical routes and all transport modes.

Action
This project is effectively an advisory project, where the Council will be an active 
partner and resilience champion for the following projects:

•  Coastal cycleways: improving cycle network and coastal defence
•  Petone to Ngauranga link: addressing vulnerability of link between Hutt and 

central Wellington 

•  Let’s Get Wellington Moving: reducing congestion in the central city 
•  Future of the Port: reducing vulnerability of the port
This will involve the Council strongly advocating for application of resilience 
principles in these projects. This could include greater inclusiveness through more 
meaningful engagement on end-user needs during project design and delivery, 
resourcefulness by encouraging infrastructure that serves multiple purposes, or 
robustness by ensuring that worst-case climate change projections are considered 
during project design phases.

Resilience co-benefits
As a group, these projects will improve access into the city for people and goods, 
as well as encouraging active lifestyles. All road users will benefit. It will provide 
redundancy in transport while improving everyday options. Advocating strongly 
for active use of resilience principles will ensure that co-benefits are maximised. 
Key projects that will connect with this initiative are encouraging adoption of 
electric vehicles (Project 29), undertaking recovery planning (Project 18) and 
developing a climate adaptation plan (Project 16).

A resilient transport network has 
inbuilt redundancy and flexibility 
to cope with disaster. It can also 
encourage an active lifestyle.

Mexico City

Inspiration from 100RC network  
– Mexico’s integrated mobility system
Mexico’s vision is to have an integrated mobility system that prioritises public 
transportation over private vehicles and provides a safe urban environment for 
pedestrians and cyclists.
Rather than accept traffic congestion, the city has decided to act decisively to promote 
an integrated mobility system to revitalise Mexico; discourage the use of private 
vehicles; create a safe and accessible city for pedestrians and cyclists; prepare the 
mobility system for the potential risks and effects of climate change, and promote the 
use of data to improve decision making on mobility.
Mexico City focusses on mobility, not cars, which resonates with many 
Wellingtonians, as does the explicit connection to climate change and revitalisation. 
Improved mobility also has a very real benefit in reducing air pollution and traffic 
congestion, with health and social co-benefits.

100 Resilient CitiesWellington Resilience StrategyImplementing Wellington’s 
Resilience Strategy

Producing a strategy is 
not the end of thinking 
about resilience – 
it’s the beginning.

We are currently working on an Implementation Plan that will assign responsibilities, 
time frames and resources to ensure the projects are delivered and their resilience 
value realised. Collectively, the projects will begin the process of integrating resilience 
thinking into all decisions affecting the future of our city, including long-term 
planning. Many Wellingtonians have already put up their hand to join the project teams. 
We hope many more will join in as we start delivering our resilience projects.
A number of leaders have been identified and organised into a Resilience Steering Group 
that will empower key sectors to integrate and adapt resilience thinking into their work.
Steering Group members have been drawn from Central Government; the social and 
housing sectors; Wellington, Hutt City and Porirua City councils; Civil Defence; the 
insurance and commercial sectors; and academia.  
As well as monitoring progress, the group will undertake a 3-year review early in 
2020 to provide recommendations to further improve the strategy. This could include 
amending the project list in consideration of lessons learned, refining our goals and 
programmes, and reviewing our resilience challenges to ensure they remain relevant. 
The Steering Group will formally report to Wellington, Porirua and Hutt City councils 
annually in February.
