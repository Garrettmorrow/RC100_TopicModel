aims at becoming more transparent and accountable, 
streamlining the city’s processes and fostering 
collaboration and engagement

Green city: We need nature in Athens. The city of 
the future will meet our human need for proximity to 
nature and be able to withstand climate change and 
environmental challenges. The city aims at integrating 
natural systems into the urban fabric, making our city 
cleaner, promoting sustainable mobility and co-creating 
public spaces, fostering sustainable food systems and 
establishing sustainable and equitable energy system.

Proactive city: Athens will streamline and up-scale 
its best ‘survival’ skills, and through planning and 
communication, it will create trustworthy and a safe 
environment for its people. The city wants to enhance 
planning in the face of serious challenges, empower the 
municipal representatives as well as the voice of the local 
community and engage with the neighborhoods 

Vibrant city: Athens will nurture and develop its assets in 
order to promote well-being, creativity, entrepreneurship 
and a new, inclusive, and exciting identity. The city aims at 
enhancing the city’s identity and promoting new types of 
belonging as well as maximizing existing city assets and 
supporting employment.

Executive Summary

The City of Athens, a venerable yet intricate city of 
near 700.000 residents, part of  a 3.75 million people 
metropolis, is for several years now facing a serious 
socio-economic crisis. Through concerted efforts, the 
city has managed to survive, to adapt and to transform 
into a more creative and collaborative city. The struggle 
is by no means over. This last year, calling on the insights 
and expertise of hundreds of stakeholders, from opinion 
leaders and academics to women migrants and the 
homeless, the city drafted its Resilience Strategy. This is 
a set of practicable actions which first of all strengthen 
and scales up what has made our city stronger: formal 
and informal networks and alliances. Athens Resilience 
Strategy offers a set of new integrated ways to prepare 
and protect our most vulnerable from future shocks and 
stresses that the city will face.

Boosting the city’s resilience means creating new as well 
as revitalizing existing open and green public spaces. This 
is vital for our densely built and populated city, threatened 
by both intense heat (climate change) and earthquakes. 
The city needs to become more forward thinking and 
proactive, turning its challenges into resources (vacant 
buildings, newly arrived refugee and migrant populations, 
energy and waste). Around such resources it will build 
capacity and start to develop economies that, together 
with tourism and the creative sector, will generate 
the city’s future. Finally the city will strengthen its 
government, through becoming more transparent and 
accountable, opening streams of communication, creating 
a digital agenda and innovation strategy. 

This work does not stand alone; it is supported by several 
documents that have been instigated by or produced 
in alliance with the city’s resilience journey. The first 
one came out of the 100RC Athens Network Exchange 
in September 2016 under the title “Global Migration: 
Resilient Cities at the Forefront,” and the second is a 
set of policy proposals “Advancing Equity for Athens’ 
Resilience” created for the city by Transatlantic Policy 
Lab program as a 100RC offering and funded by the 
Bertelsmann Foundation. Finally the Athens Climate 
Change Adaptation and Mitigation Action plan was 
produced through a unique collaboration between C40 
and 100RC. These two documents together with the 
existing Athens strategic and operational plans, frame this 
resilience strategy.

The resilience strategy is framed by four pillars, 65 actions 
and 53 supporting actions. 

Open city: The City of Athens will achieve effective 
and efficient governance and manage to communicate 
and collaborate better with its residents by fostering 
data driven policy making and accountability. The city

Letter from Mayor of Athens, Georgios Kaminis

Creating a resilient Athens will be difficult and it will take 
time. But I believe we need to do it and we can do it, 
together, starting now. 

Dear friends,

I am proud to present to you the Athens’ Resilience 
Strategy, a cohesive strategic plan for 2030, with a 
vision, measurable goals and prioritized actions, that 
provides a new way of thinking on how to expand Athens’ 
robustness, flexibility and inclusiveness. 

In tandem with cities all over the world, following the 
guidelines and guidance set by the international urban 
network 100 Resilient Cities, this resilience strategy 
was designed in collaboration with a wide spectrum of 
Athenian stakeholders from academic institutions, the 
public and private sectors as well as from civil society. 

It provides a dynamic roadmap that, in dialogue with 
the strategies and action plans currently in place for 
our city, includes and guides our efforts today, but also 
articulates our city’s future challenges providing solutions 
for tomorrow’s municipal leaders and residents. This plan 
acknowledges that we need everyone to be involved in 
the design and implementation of long-term interventions 
that will build the resilience of this metropolitan capital.

It is the people of Athens that have been and will be the 
key to the resilience of their city. Their agility and tenacity 
have been crucial every time that a disaster hits our city. 
It is with the assistance of the Athenians that we managed 
to support the most vulnerable of our populations during 
the hard last seven years of economic recession and 
the recent large refugee flows. As it is through broad 
collaborations and synergies we formed with local and 
international networks, organizations and institutions that 
we were able to keep this city on its feet.  

But we have to look to the future in order to be effective 
today. The Athens’ Resilience Strategy is a forward 
thinking strategic intervention that aims at building an 
open, green, proactive and vibrant city by 2030.

Michael Berkowitz

city’s assets and provide multiple benefits, like utilizing 
abandoned buildings to accommodate vulnerable 
populations, such as refugees and the homeless; or like 
creating green and cultural corridors to reclaim much 
needed green public space, reduce noise and unrest, 
mitigate the heat island effect, and foster further social 
cohesion by placing the citizen at the forefront. Many 
other such comprehensive projects abound.

Through the commitment and hard work of CRO Myrivili 
and her team, the Strategy provides an ambitious but 
practicable program and reflects the diversity of voices 
and communities engaged during its development. It also 
reflects the active role Athens has already played in our 
network, not least by hosting and leading a 100RC city 
exchange on migration late last year. The lessons and 
collaborations that formed during that exchange continue 
to lead to groundbreaking work and policy. 

This Strategy reflects months of effort and tireless 
leadership, but in many ways the hard work is just 
beginning as the city sets forth on implementation. We 
are excited to see Athens continue to form a bridge 
between its rich past and the most important issues of the 
present and future as it does so. We are eager to continue 
the next stage of our partnership and collaborate in the 
implementation of this groundbreaking Strategy that will 
help ensure a resilient future for Athens and propel the 
resilience effort worldwide. 

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want 
to congratulate Mayor Kaminis, the City of Athens, and 
Chief Resilience Officer Eleni Myrivili on the release of 
“Athens 2030,” the city’s Resilience Strategy, a major 
milestone for the city and 100RC’s partnership with it. 

Steeped in an ancient and storied past, Athens stands 
at the crossroads of the challenges and opportunities 
of the present. It has experienced several extreme 
transformations throughout its history, from serving 
as the cradle of democracy and western civilization in 
antiquity, to fading into an Ottoman outpost of only 5000 
people in the 19th century, to emerging as the dynamic 
and densely populated metropolis it is today. As Athens 
continues its recovery from the economic crisis and 
subsequent austerity measures, and the sudden influx 
of migrants and refugees, it is poised to shape its future 
from the opportunities presented by its challenges. This 
Strategy provides the city a framework for actions that 
ensure this is a future in which Athens not only survives 
but thrives.

With “Athens 2030,” the city has set itself on a course 
to form meaningful urban resilience through plans 
that account for the city’s entire urban ecosystem.  It 
addresses not only the city’s shocks, such as earthquakes, 
and civil unrest, but its chronic stresses, such as heat 
waves, homelessness, poor air quality, long-term 
unemployment, and other continuous pressures that 
erode the urban fabric and exacerbate the major shocks 
when those do occur. 

The city stands at the forefront of many challenges faced 
by the rest of Europe, and beyond. As it implements the 
Strategy and its integrated inter-systemic solutions, it can 
serve as a model to others. The Strategy’s four pillars -- 
Open city, Proactive city, Green city, Vibrant city – present 
a holistic framework with interventions that maximize the

Letter from CRO, Eleni Myrivili

The Athens’ Resilience Strategy marks an important 
moment in the history of the city. It is the first strategy 
that equips our city with new ways of thinking of and 
dealing with the chronic stresses and the acute shocks 
that we are likely to experience. The problems that cities 
face in the 21st century can no longer be dealt with the 
old solutions and tools. Urban Resilience is about facing 
and learning to adapt to hard challenges in ways that 
look towards the future. It’s about being able to shift 
our point of view, redefine our goals and develop skills 
that make us stronger. Resilience is all about dynamic 
transformation. Athens has survived and is still adapting 
to a lot of adversity. We still need however to find ways to 
do it better. To see our challenges as opportunities that 
can make us thrive in the near future. This is why this is a 
strategy with its eyes on 2030. 

This Resilience Strategy has been created through 
collaborations and many hours of listening to a broad 
range of individuals and organizations. For Athens, 
resilience has been achieved and will always be about 
building connections between people and breaking down 
silos between administrative departments, different 
levels of governance, the public and private sectors, civil 
society and academic institutions. These connections 
can stimulate not only thought but also action. It is with 
the help, knowledge, insight and the dedicated time of 
many Athenians, that we managed to co-design specific 
goals and clear, actionable steps that facilitate effective 
implementation. We would like to acknowledge and 
sincerely thank all of you for your generosity of thought 
and all of your input.

But designing, building and acting have feeble results 
if there is no clear vision. This Strategy has gathered 
diverse images of the city’s future and articulates a 
concise vision. We see a city that in 2030 is open, green, 
proactive and vibrant. This can be reached though eco-

social policies that elevate the role of local government 
and give it its rightful place as a major player in economic 
development and employment services, social welfare 
and environmental adaptation and resilience, and clean-
tech and technological innovation. 

The strategy alone will not achieve this vision. Publishing 
and disseminating it, continuing to shape it with the 
people of the municipality and our communities, and 
getting individuals and organizations actively involved, is 
what will keep it alive and relevant. 

An Open Invitation

This invitation goes out to everyone committed to helping 
to protect and improve the lives of all Athenians. Help us 
strengthen the city as it prepares for the future. 

Individuals, community groups, institutions and private 
businesses, let us know new ways of thinking or doing 
things for the city; tell us about projects that can 
transform it; work with us to implement resilience actions 
that inspire you. 

Resilience is about being prepared for and open to, 
change and transformation. This is not a fixed strategy: 
our world is changing too fast. What our strategy 
provides is a framework that demonstrates while 
embedding the logic of resilience in policy-making. We’re 
all in this together.

Introduction

Why a Resilience Strategy? 

Like many cities around the world, Athens is adjusting 
to the challenges of the 21st century. Hyper-connected 
economies are radically changing patterns in world 
markets and employment; the effects of climate 
change are increasingly apparent; social, ethnic and 
health inequalities are deepening; resources are 
becoming scarcer while consumption is growing; and 
authoritarianism and/or ethno-national movements are 
on the rise.  Urban communities and economies will have 
to develop tools and skills that will help them survive, 
adapt and thrive in the face of multiple and unpredictable 
disruptions.

Athens has experienced significant shocks during the 
recent past, that exposed the weaknesses of the city 
and the long-term stresses underlying them. The socio-
economic crisis laid bare the failings and limitations within 
the city. It also revealed the city’s essential strengths, 
hidden resources and talents. The question is - how 
can Athens reflect, learn and proactively put in place 
resourceful, robust and inclusive systems that not only 
deal with current difficulties and shortcomings but also 
transform the city and make it strong and successful for a 
future that will bring new challenges?

The declining incomes, growing personal debt, and high 
real estate taxes, coupled with austerity measures that 
drove cuts in social services, hit our most vulnerable 
populations the hardest. Unprecedented levels of 
unemployment, poverty and homelessness grew in our 
city, exposing our lack of preparation, together with the 
pressing need to have systems in place able to provide for 
the basic needs of the most exposed. The City of Athens 
rose to the challenge: through partnerships with NGOs 
and the private sector we built and are still building a 
robust system for critical relief and social services as well 
as a rationalized system of data collection and logistics. 
Moving forward, such partnerships, no less than such data 
collection and development systems, should be scaled-
up and replicated horizontally in city government, leading 
to an open and vibrant city where data based decision 
making, transparency and accountability.

Climate change is increasing the risk of extreme events, 
undermining many assumptions we have been using to 
plan and develop our city. There is insufficient climate 
protection of existing buildings, while, in the vast 
majority, public works and new building construction 
disregard local climate conditions. In addition, the lack 
of updated legislation on energy and environmental 
protection for buildings and other urban infrastructure, 
have contributed to an increase in the urban heat island 
effect, the social and economic decline and desolation of 
the city center, the socio-economic squeeze of the lower 
income brackets, as well as pushing 23% of our residents 
into energy poverty. The Athens Climate Change 
Adaptation and Mitigation Action Plans, an outcome of 
our collaboration with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership 
Group, are a fundamental part of this Resilience Strategy. 
They outline concrete steps for improving the urban 
quality of life in the face of increasing temperatures, 
flash floods and bad air quality. Climate change resilience 
should pervade all city’s decisions and policies; it should 
become embedded in the administrations economic logic 
and reflexes.   

Other examples of challenges for Athens are: 

• Sharp decline in the population
• Large influx of refugees
• Increasingly aging infrastructure
• Threat of earthquakes, violence, and civil unrest
• Fragmented government structure and overlapping 

jurisdictions. 

The Resilience Strategy paves the way for a city 
that is proactive, setting forth concrete actions that 
address issues of maintenance, safety, efficiency and 
accountability, crisis preparedness and management. 

The large flows of refugees through our city, in numbers 
that exceeded the total number of our residents during 
2015 and 2016, intensified the pressures on our social 
services and critical relief activities. This influx increased 
the pressure on our waste management system, the 
demand for social housing, and highlighted the lack of 
existing integration programs. Nevertheless, the refugees 
present an opportunity vital for the city. 

The austerity driven budget cuts to local governments 
and thus public works, revealed our aging infrastructure 
and the need to put into place robust maintenance 
programs and long term integrated planning. 

The Athens earthquake of 1999 revealed the city’s lack 
of preparedness. This is a significant challenge as Greece 
is considered a country that has the 6th highest seismic 
activity level in the world. A set of resilience building 
actions address our built environment in an integrated 
and proactive way, linking this weakness to dynamic 
development and urban transformation projects. 

Violence and civil unrest have also been changing the 
urban landscape during the socio-economic crisis, and 
there is long standing need for new perspectives that can 
keep the city safe. 

Last but not least, long standing problems of Athens 
directly related to urban planning, public transportation 
and urban mobility, air quality and the city’s green and 
blue infrastructures, are significant to planning and 
implementing resilience on a metropolitan scale.  

The Athens Resilience Strategy, developed with the 
support of 100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by the 
Rockefeller Foundation –, presents a series of distinct yet 
connected actions with a clear vision of how the city can 
best cope with the increasing interdependency of shocks 
and stresses. It links new resilience-building actions 
with existing efforts, and relies heavily on our urban 
communities, who proved effective and resilient during 
times of crisis.

Urban resilience and 100 Resilient Cities

The Rockefeller Foundation pioneered the 100RC 
initiative in response to the trends of urbanization, 
globalization and climate change. 

Definition of resilience

100RC defines urban resilience as the capacity of individuals, institutions, 
businesses and systems within a city to adapt, survive and thrive no matter what 
kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience. 

As cities grow larger, the likely 
consequences of unexpected events 
are ever greater for individual cities. 
Cities are also more numerous and 
increasingly interdependent, meaning 

the effects of events in one place can 
be felt around the world. Meanwhile, 
climate change increased the likelihood 
of great numbers of catastrophic 
events happening. 

Chronic Stresses

Acute Shocks

Challenges that weaken the fabric of a city on a day-
to-day or cyclical basis. Examples include sea level 
rise, increasing pressures on healthcare services, 
unemployment, and deeper social inequality.

Sudden events that threaten a city. Examples include 
earthquakes, heat-waves, flash-floods, and cyber attacks.

Introduction

Athens’ resilience challenges 

Each city’s resilience journey begins with a diagnostic 
assessment that delineates its own significant challenges. 
Through several months of interviewing and engaging 
people from different Athenian communities, including 
that of the academic and administrative experts on 
natural and man-made disasters, Resilient Athens 
prioritized the following shocks and stresses as the most 
important for our city.

Acute Shocks

For every 1°C temperature increase in Athens
• 5.2% increase in mortality rates for the period 
2000-2012 (for Tdaily,MAX>31.5°C)
• 6% increase in smog for Tdaily,MAX>22°C 
(correlated to asthma and respiratory illnesses)
• 10% drop in sales at cities (for Athens at 
Tdaily,MAX>36°C)
• 4.1% increase in the use of electricity in the city  

Shock #1: Earthquakes
Over 30% of buildings in the City of Athens were 
constructed before the first building code for earthquake 
protection, a serious vulnerability in a country with the 
6th highest seismic activity level in the world. The city’s 
urban environment is densely populated, streets are 
narrow, public open spaces are few, and the building 
stock is aging (only a small part of its has been evaluated 
and fortified against earthquakes). The city is unprepared 
to confront another serious seismic event. 

The Athens July 21st, 1987, and a lethal heatwave 
• Lasting almost 10 days, 
• 2,000 heat related deaths.
• Tdaily,max= 41-44°C,  Tnight,min>28°C (for 10 
days long)
• 2960 heat-related admissions recorded in 
hospitals
• 31% fatalities among admitted cases

The Athens September 7th, 1999 earthquake 
• 5.9 on the Richter scale 
• 138 people died, 
• 74,053 houses were completely or partially 
destroyed (homes for 209,842 people)
• 8,388 enterprises were completely or partially 
destroyed (850 closed permanently)
• The total number of people affected was estimated 
at 100,000

Shock #3: Civil Unrest
Demonstrations take place in Athens almost on a daily 
basis, and are organized by labor unions, political parties, 
anti-authoritarian groups, student groups, and other 
collectivities. These demonstrations vary in size and 
intensity but they always take place in the city center. In 
some cases they become violent riots that can last for 
several days. They exert extraordinary pressures on the 
city’s daily functions, logistics and infrastructures. Under 
the ongoing conditions of socio-economic crisis, the city 
often feels like a pressure cooker.

Shock #2: Climate Change related Shocks 
(Heat waves, flash floods, poor air quality)
Climate change scenarios indicate that extreme heat 
events are expected to typify the city’s future. Between 
2021 and 2050, average summer temperatures in Athens 
are projected to increase by 2°C; between 2071 and 2100 
the projected increase goes up to 4°C. We are already 
observing a gradual increase in the length and level of 
high temperatures as well as the frequency and intensity 
of heat waves and other related phenomena such as 
flash floods and bad air quality. The Athenian Urban 
Heat Island, intensified by the rising heat, exhibits severe 
temperature differences reaching 6°C, 7°C even 10°C 
between the city center and its suburbs. The density, 
anarchy and bad quality of our built urban fabric, as well 
as the lack of green open spaces are the main culprits. 

During the period 2011-2015, throughout Greece 
27,103 demonstrations were organized, averaging 15 
per day. 

28-29 June 2011, 35 damaged businesses, cost 
500.000€
19-20 October 2011, 62 damaged businesses, cost 
400.000€
12 February 2012, 200 damaged businesses, cost 
70.000.000€
Municipal Cleaning service of Athens collected:
12 February 2012: 40 tonnes pieces of marble 
and rocks
6 December 2014: 50 tonnes of rocks

14

Shock #4: Cybercrime
Cybercrime in Greece is a rising challenge. The City of 
Athens is at the center of many operational decision 
making procedures while also hosting several critical 
infrastructures and public utility networks. It is therefore 
a high-risk target for cyber attacks. According to the 
National Intelligence Service and specifically the National 
Authority Against Electronic Attacks (NAAEA), 2016 was 
one of the worst years for cyber-attacks in Greece and 
worldwide. These attacks are advanced and sophisticated, 
mostly targeting governmental databases and websites. 
The City of Athens is in close collaboration with these 
agencies to prepare a robust prevention plan against such 
attacks. The Greek Cybercrime Center (GCC) is part of 
an emerging coordinated European effort, which has the 
capacity to significantly improve education and research 
in the newly growing area of cybercrime.

Online behavioral patterns
According to Eurostat, in 2014, 49% of the Greek 
population used the Internet every day, while in 
2005, the daily usage of the Internet was only 
up to 11%. Greek internet users have the lowest 
level (37%) of confidence (Eurobarometer 390 / 
Wave EB77.2 – TNS Opinion & Social) in using the 
internet for things like online banking or buying 
things online and a very high percentage (81%) 
of believing that their online personal information 
is not kept secure by public authorities.

Stress #2: Aging Infrastructure
Many buildings in Athens are of very poor quality, have 
unsafe structural elements, and are not energy efficient. 
They do not comply with the regulatory guidelines for 
the Greek Building Code and their increasing energy 
demands add to the city’s greenhouse gas emissions 
and energy poverty rates. Beyond our building stock, all 
infrastructures in Athens are suffering from lack of proper 
maintenance, lack of proactive long term planning, lack 
of data and data driven policies. The economic recession 
(including a 60% municipal budget cut since 2011), has 
exacerbated the problem: our roads, pavements, parks, 
playgrounds, facades, garbage bins, etc., are openly 
showing their deterioration, their age and scars. 

Stress #3: Migration
By the end of 2016 about 60.000 newcomers – refugees 
and immigrants - were recorded as living in Greece. 
Around 20.000 of them are currently living in Athens: half 
of them are Syrians while others come from Afghanistan, 
Palestine, Iran and Kurdistan. All of them (nearly 97%) 
arrived through Turkey and only 8% of them are willing to 
stay in Greece. Since 2015 over a million people crossed 
through Greek territories on their way to a better and 
safer life in the European Union. The initial shock has 
become a stress for the city neighborhood and systems 
that are struggling with unemployment, poverty, budget 
cuts and aging infrastructures.

Chronic Stresses

€

?

Stress #1: Depressed Macroeconomic Conditions

Since 2009, Greece has been in recession, with depressed 
macroeconomic conditions and severe cuts in social 
and public services. High unemployment has been the 
worst of its consequences. According to the Hellenic 
Statistical Authority, in January 2017 the Attica region 
unemployment rate was 22.7%.  

In an economy that has shrunk by 25% since the beginning 
of the crisis, poverty and homelessness are rising, and 
so are taxes and private debt – at 222 billion euros in 
2016. Many Athenians are struggling with delinquent 
loans (31.75 of all housing loans) and the threat of home 
repossessions. 

Stress #4: Mistrust
During 2016, the Greek Ombudsman issued a report 
analyzing the widely spread feeling of mistrust between 
citizens and public services. This is only a small aspect 
of the large phenomenon of mistrust that Athenians 
have towards all levels of government, administrative 
or elected. This is the outcome of centuries of political 
partisanship and mismanagement of resources, corruption 
and clientelism, lack of transparency and accountability. 
Unfortunately mistrust, pervasive and insidious, keeps 
undermining a lot of worthy effort.

Introduction

About 100RC

100 Resilient Cities (100RC), pioneered by the Rockefeller 
Foundation, is dedicated to helping cities around the 
world become more resilient to the physical, social, and 
economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st 
century. 100RC supports the adoption and incorporation 
of a view of resilience that includes not just the shocks but 
also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day 
to day or cyclical basis. By addressing both the shocks 
and the stresses, a city becomes more able to respond to 
adverse events, and is overall better able to deliver basic 
functions in both good times and bad, to all populations. 

Cities in the 100RC network are provided with the 
resources necessary to develop a roadmap to resilience 
along four main pathways:

100 Resilient Cities Network

City Resilience Framework

The 100RC program uses a framework – developed by 
Arup and the Rockefeller Foundation - called the City 
Resilience Framework (CRF). The CRF acts as a lens that 
brakes down the complexity of city systems and analyses 

their specific function in the drivers that contribute to 
city resilience. The framework is made up of four main 
dimensions and 12 drivers that together illustrate what 
makes a resilient city.

City Resilience Index (Arup and Rockefeller Foundation, 2014)

Qualities

A resilient city also exhibits seven qualities, which should 
be evident in the way the city – or any system, function or 
asset within the city – operates. These are:

Reflective

Resourceful

Inclusive

Integrated

Robust

Redundant

Flexible

Using past 
experience to 
inform future 
decisions

Recognizing 
alternative ways to 
use resources

Prioritize broad 
consultation to 
create sense of 
shared ownership 
in decision 
making 

Bring together a 
range of distinct 
systems and 
institutions

Well-conceived, 
constructed, and 
managed systems

Spare capacity 
purposively 
created to 
accommodate 
disruption

Willingness, 
ability to adopt 
alternatives 
strategies 
in response 
to changing 
circumstances

17

Vision for a 

Resilient Athens

18

By 2030 Athens strives to be a responsive, embracing 
and inspirational city, that is proud, green and citizen-
led. We nurture creativity and innovation, creating 
prototypes of belonging, bridging history and 
progress. Athens is a city that listens and speaks with 
the world.

City milestones

1. A rapidly expanding City

The metropolitan area of Athens covers today an 
expansion of 2.929 Km2 with a population of 3.75 million 
people. While already a capital, the city underwent a 
period of rapid development and modernization after 
the Second World War with growth rates of up to 8 
percent per year.. Between 1951 and 1981, the population 
of the urban area more than doubled, from 1,379,000 to 
3,027,090 inhabitants. 

Economic growth and entry into the EU in 1981 brought 
new investment and credit which raised the standard of 
living. Massive housing construction quickly changed 
the character of Athens, imposing a modern but at times 
haphazard character. New infrastructure developed, such 
as public transportation, but growth was chaotic with a 
proliferation of “polykatoikia,” the multi-story residential 
building. Home ownership became one of the most 
important tenets of identity of the new urban middle 
class.

Population Density (Source: Sustainable Urban Development Plan, 2014)

The new urban lifestyle emphasized modernity, hygiene 
and amenities such as central heating, and social 
integration. The typology of the “polykatoikia” has 
permitted mixed uses (residential and commercial) as well 
as vertical stratification among social classes and ethnic 
identities. Athens thus avoided the creation of urban 
“ghettos.” At the same time, the “polykatoikias” present 
extraordinary fragmentation. It is not unusual for a block 
in the city center to have over 500 different owners. In 
the early 1980s, the stress of urban congestion, traffic, 
noise, Urban Heat Island (UHI) and air pollution resulted 
in urban flight and a move to the suburbs. But Athens 
remained among the most dense municipalities in the 
developed world.

In the absence of integrated planning the pressure on 
the natural environment grew exponentially. Massive 
construction and a rapidly growing road system signified 
a depletion of peri-urban green and the covering of the 
majority of the natural water network of the Attica plain 
including its two rivers. This has directly contributed to 
increased temperatures and recurring flush-floods today 
as well as increasing the risk of earthquake damages.

The first spatial plan with a metropolitan vision was 
adopted in 1985, and the Organization for the Planning 
and Environmental Protection of Athens (ORSA), 
was created to monitor its implementation. The plan 
marked an ambitious effort to curb sprawl, reduce social 
disparities and enhance the environmental protection, all 
from an institutional and regulatory perspective. However, 
the selection of Athens as host city of the 2004 Olympic 
Games meant that metropolitan spatial planning was 
bypassed in favor of urgent, large infrastructure needs. A 
wave of developments transformed the metropolitan area 
enabling urban sprawl and increasing car dependency. 
The Olympic Games ended up being a lost opportunity 
for a long-term metropolitan strategic plan. Ten years on, 
the debate on the metropolitan governance of Athens has 
not led anywhere.

2. The years of socio-economic crisis

The global financial crisis of 2007–2008 exposed 
the fragility of the Greek economy and its façade of 
prosperity based on debt. The deficits caused the country 
to borrow and international lending institution (the 
European Union, The European Central Bank, and the 
International Monetary Fund), start dictating the Greek 
government’s fiscal decisions. Austerity imposed in 2010 
led to a harsh recession and high unemployment. By 2015, 
Greeks had lost 33% of purchasing power and 25% of 
income. 

Meanwhile, the population decreased. Construction, in 
decline after the Olympics, collapsed. Thousands of new 
apartments stood empty; renovations stalled. Mortgage 
debt and new property taxes hit property ownership. 
The number of homeless increased and food and energy 
poverty grew. Immigrants without job prospects became 
more marginalized and desperate, while the Fascist party 
“Golden Dawn” grew as did incidents of hate crimes. The 
sudden collapse of the central state social welfare system 
and the shock of the crisis created however a new wave 
of citizen mobilization and solidarity networks and led the 
Municipality adopting a more expansive role in the sphere 
of social policy. 

City of Athens social policy

•  Covering Daily Meals for 1400 people
•  Citizen’s Solidarity Hub: social grocery, social pharmacy, social laundry, psychological and legal support, food 
and clothing “store” for 26.000 beneficiaries
•  46.468 Food Vouchers from EAA grants: 9.000 beneficiaries
•  10.000 families receive monthly food baskets (FEAD: 2016-2017)
•  35.000 residents on Guaranteed Minimum Income 2017
•  5000 senior citizens are members of the Athens Senior Clubs
•  15.000 Residents are receiving social benefits
•  50 families hosted in social apartments
•  20 women hosted in the city Shelter for battered women
• 58.000 health related visits per year to our 6 Municipal Health Clinics

The parts of the economy that kept growing during the 
crisis were the tourism and cultural sectors. The city 
started re-branding itself as the visitors also began to 
look beyond its classical monuments and landmarks. New 
ones, like the new National Museum of Contemporary 
Art (EMST) and the Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, 
among others are taking their rightful turn.

Equally significant is the recent rise of creative industries. 
Albeit the brain drain a significant number of highly 
educated and talented young Athenians are creating 
new types of growth areas in the city’s economy. Despite 
the crisis, the cultural and creative sectors seem to be 
recovering contributing about 5% to the regional GDP. 

Opportunities in times of crisis

The severe socio-economic crisis, however, also revealed 
the powers of solidarity and creativity in Greek society. 
The crisis led to the growth of civil society. The nonprofit 
sector, grassroots organizations and informal groups are 
providing services that improve the city’s quality of life.

The metropolitan question in a centralized country 

The last effort to streamline and decentralize the complex 
system of sub-national authorities was the 2011 Kallikratis 
reform that reduced the municipalities from 1034 to 325. 
Still, it failed to truly reform fiscal resource allocation 
across and within levels of government.  

For example, public transportation improvements are a 
pressing challenge. In 2011, the Greek government merged 
several operating companies streamlining transportation 
governance in the Athens metropolitan area under OASA. 
OASA operates under the Ministry of Infrastructure, 
Transport and Networks; there is no co-ordination with 
the local or regional authorities on transport planning. 

In Attica as in the rest of Greece, informally developed 
areas are usually incorporated ex post facto within official 
town boundaries: an additive logic. Uncontrolled growth 
causes car-dependency, congestion, air pollution and 
the degradation of the environment. According to a 2015 
OECD report, despite efforts to guide urban growth, a 
series of structural challenges have remained: 

• a gap between planning and implementation; 
• a gap between spatial planning and socio-economic 

• the incomplete development of basic land management 

planning; 

tools; 

• and the lack of participatory planning. 

In order to further Resilience in Athens, metropolitan 
governance reforms and a carefully designed financial 
scheme, must be implemented. Stakeholder mobilization 
has to focus on a shared set of policy priorities for a more 
Open, Green, Proactive and Vibrant City of Athens. 

3. Changing demographics: Two waves of migrant and 
refugee flows 

After the 1989 collapse of the eastern bloc, Athens 
experienced a massive influx of economic migrants from 
the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Asian and African countries 
recording a 463.91% increase between 1991 and 2011 In 
line with the urban sprawl of Greek populations towards 
the suburbs, with rates reaching over 20 percent which 
had left a high number of vacancies at the dense city 
center they took cheap apartments, ground floors or 
basements of old “polykatoikias” changing for the first 
time the until then homogeneous demographic.

Starting in 2014 but peaking in the summer of 2015, 
during the sixth consecutive year into an economic crisis, 
close to a million refugees arrived in Athens on their 
long journey to other European countries. Within the 
course of a few weeks, city squares and parks quickly 
became the unofficial meeting point and temporary 
home for thousands of refugees. Creating a major 
shock for the city Athens, with very little infrastructure 
in place or experience in refugee reception, suddenly 
found itself in the forefront of the biggest refugee 
movement since World War II in Europe. Currently there 
are around 20.000 migrants and refugees living within 
the municipality of Athens constituting thus about a 5% 
increase in the population.

The central government excessively 
controls key authorities and 
jurisdictions, hampering local 
governance. Regions and 
municipalities rely on government 
transfers and EU funding. While some 
weak mechanisms for metropolitan-
wide co-ordination and planning do 
exist, they face significant institutional 
and operational limits.

Athens and resilience

Building a resilience strategy 

Through a competitive process the City of Athens was 
selected in 2014 to join the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) 
network. The city engaged in an intense and participatory 
process in order to draft and implement a holistic, robust 
and realistic strategy that supports and enhances the 
resilience of the city for the upcoming decades. 

Based on these diagnostic activities, in July 2016, we 
released Athens’s Preliminary Resilience Assessment 
(PRA). The PRA set the resilience baseline for Athens, 
introducing 5 discovery areas that the city had to explore 
more in order to discover opportunities that would help it 
built its resilience.  The discovery areas are:

In the spring of 2015, Athens introduced the concepts and 
methods of the 100 Resilient Cities program by convening 
an Agenda Setting Workshop (with 130 Athenians). 
February 2016, the city started its resilience-building 
journey by establishing the Office of Resilience and 
Sustainability (ORS) and drafting a robust Stakeholder 
Engagement Plan. The ORS became a part of the new 
organizational structure of the municipality gaining 
official status (Government Gazette No 3812/B’/28-11-
2016) as part of the Mayor’s Office in December 2016. 

For several months, in the beginning of the program 
we interviewed Athenians, from experts, artists and 
community leaders to industrialists, homeless and women 
migrants, asking them what they thought made our city 
resilient and how they envisioned a resilient Athens in 
2030. We also started by creating a registry of all the 
projects and programs planned for or implemented in 
Athens. Along with all the other cities we also identified 
our city’s critical assets, shocks and stresses. 

• Maximize the dynamic of the Athenian neighborhood
• Data driven and inclusive city
• Nature in the city: Best possible use of urban resources
• Crisis within crisis   
• Enhance social cohesion (cross-cutting)

Numerous people including experts, representatives 
from the local, regional and central government, city-
district leaders and other civil society and community 
ambassadors, platform partners and the strategy partner 
actively participated in the process. Through desktop 
research, interviews, working group meetings, workshops 
and conferences, we examined the specific opportunities 
and challenges that started emerging. This process 
helped us shape our vision for a resilient Athens -- a city 
that is open, green, proactive and vibrant.

A year and a half after the beginning of the Resilient 
Athens program, the city is bestowed with this strategic 
document created in collaboration with 140 organizations 
and 900 citizens which participated in 40 workshops, 
conferences or public events. During this year Resilient 
Athens also initiated and co-hosted international meetings 
with fellow cities; international and local experts worked 
together trying to get a better grasp of the challenges the 
city is facing as they searched for resilient solutions. 

Beyond the main three international collaborations 
around the themes of Migration (100RC), Climate 
Change (C40 Cites) and Social Equity (Bertelsmann 
Foundation), our office also co-organized together with 
other municipalities, central government representatives, 
NGOs and the Heinrich Bell Foundation two multiple 
day conferences on Municipal Energy Savings and 
Energy Poverty with about 200 participants. We also co-
organized with Symbiosis - Center for Political Studies of 
the Council of Europe, a two-day workshop on Open Data 
and local government with 100 participants including 
administrators from four other municipalities, relevant 
ministries and public utility companies.

Four big cross-sectoral and cross-jurisdictional working 
groups of more than 100 people were also part of this 
very busy and inspiring year, along with several smaller 
workshops. They all aimed at breaking municipal and 
cross level administrative silos while focusing on the 
following themes: heat waves and the urban heat island 
effects, greening the city, Athens assets and risks, 
women entrepreneurs, migration and integration, best 
practices for social cohesion and coexistence, city 
branding and public-private sector collaborations, urban 
planning and sustainable mobility.  In February 2017, 30 
city officers and 30 citizens participated in a Problem-
Framing Workshop, organized by a 100RC platform 
partner citymart. The workshop tried to identify major 
challenges and realistic solutions to waste management 
and city cleaning. A lot of our municipal departments and 
agencies were active participants in the whole process 
providing key input regarding the everyday management 
of the city and the current legislative and regulatory 
framework of Greek local authorities.

32

Finally, the Resilience Steering Committee (RSC) played 
a crucial role as our overseeing body of experts. The RSC 
is an interdisciplinary cohort of high-level stakeholders 
from different governmental, academic and nonprofit 
institutions covering a brad range of expertise. The 
committee comprises of 18 members and is led by 
the Mayor of Athens. Their key objective is to provide 

interdisciplinary input and guidance on the content of the 
Athens resilience strategy as it develops, on its integration 
into the city’s operations, implementation and funding. 
The RSC has met four times providing valuable input 
and inspiration in the formation of the Athens Resilient 
Strategy.

Athens’ Resilience Strategy also draws upon other 
local, regional, national and international strategic 
documents, including the city’s Plan of Integrated 
Urban Intervention (SOAP), the city’s Sustainable 
Urban Development Plan (SVAA), Integrated Territorial 
Investments Actions (OXE), the New Regulatory Plan of 
Athens-Attica 2021 (RSA), as well as the Urban Agenda 
for the EU, the New Urban Agenda – Habitat III and the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals.  From early on, 
our office collaborated closely with the C40 Advisor 
for Athens, leading to the first Athens Climate Change 
Adaptation and Mitigation Plan (April 2017). This 
collaboration in Athens anticipated and underscored 

the official partnership developed between the 100RC 
Network and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership 
Group (December 2016). The connections with other 
strategic documents elevates the Athens Resilient 
Strategy’s integration and robustness, bridging the 
gaps between different institutions as well as gaps that 
exist between the city’s everyday management and its 
long-term policy commitments and goals. The Mayor 
of Athens has also signed the 10% resilience pledge 
and committed to an integrated building of resilience 
in the city, Currently, according to Arup’s brief, the city 
has achieve a 17% coverage of the pledge.

International meetings

The 100RC network connects Athens with other cities 
and organizations across the world. During its first year 
of operation, the Resilient Athens team initiated and 
hosted two international meetings with fellow 100RC 
cities, partners and experts. In July 2016, Athens 
hosted the European leg of the first Trans-Atlantic 
Policy Lab aiming to identify and propose policies 
that mitigate social inequity in the United States and 

Europe. In September 2016, Athens, in partnership with 
the 100 Resilient Cities and Chief Resilience Officers 
(CRO) from eight of its member cities launched the 
Athens Network Exchange: Cities and the Global 
Migration Crisis.

Field of Opportunities

Drawing on local proposals and best practices from 
Athens and cities around the world, especially from 
our 100RC network partners, we have identified more 
than 138 relevant opportunities to tackle resilience 
challenges. We tested and refined each opportunity 
using the principles of the 100RC City Resilience 
Framework and the Resilience and the Reality Lenses 
– tools developed by 100RC and our strategy partner 
ARUP. This ensured that resilience was embedded in 
the actions bringing the broadest possible benefits 
to the city. We then further evaluated our 138 

Athens Migration Network Exchange

opportunities during Athens Field of Opportunities 
(FoO). The FoO ensured the Athens Resilient Strategy 
is fact-based and data-driven but also, thought its 
making, a result of transparent and extensive dialogue 
and consultation with many relevant stakeholders. 
After the FoO, we had finalized the set of 65 resilient 
actions, which we reshaped and organized under 4 
pillars and 13 Resilience goals.

Following the Network Exchange, participants 
released “Global Migration: Resilient Cities at the 
Forefront”. Featuring 24 city best practices and 18 
practitioner tools, this report points to programs 
being implemented in cities across the globe that 
demonstrate how to best integrate migrants into 
their new homes, while also creating benefits for 
all residents.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's)

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Summit on 25 September 2015 includes 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals with 169 associated targets that 
demonstrate the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda. 
This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and 
prosperity. It seeks to strengthen universal peace in 
larger freedom and eradicate poverty in all its forms 
and dimensions by taking transformative steps that are 
urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable 
and resilient path. The Goals and targets are integrated 
and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of 
sustainable development: the economic, social and 
environmental. They will stimulate action over the next 
fifteen years in areas of critical importance for humanity 
and the planet.

Legislative authority:

These icons represent exisiting (or not) legislative 
authority for every action. A black icon means there is no 
legislative authority whilst an orange icon means that the 
action posseses legislative authority for implementation.

Athens wants to be:

An Open city
The City of Athens will 
achieve effective and 
efficient governance and 
manage to communicate 
and collaborate better with 
its residents by fostering 
data driven policy making 
and accountability.  

A Green city
We need nature in Athens. 
The city of the future will 
meet our human need for 
proximity to nature and be 
able to withstand climate 
change and environmental 
challenges. 

© Municipality of Athens

A Proactive city
Athens will streamline and 
up-scale its best “survival” 
skills, and through planning 
and communication, it will 
create trustworthy and a 
safe environment for its 
people.  

A Vibrant city
Athens will nurture and 
develop its assets in order 
to promote well-being, 
creativity, entrepreneurship 
and a new, inclusive, and 
exciting identity.

The CRF acts as a lens to 
understand the complexity of 
city systems and the drivers that 
contribute to city resilience. The 
framework is made up of four 
main dimensions and 12 drivers 
that together illustrate what 
makes a resilient city.

Goal A

Become more transparent and accountable

The Athens city Council and administration seem remote 
and obscure to the citizen. Apart from the fact that there 
is no culture within the municipality that values, manages 
and maintains the collection of data and KPIs, there are 
also few and weak channels of communication both among 
the different levels of administration and between the City 
of Athens and the citizens. An "open city" is a city that is 
accountable, a city that can win back the trust of its people. 
For Athens to be resilient it needs to build trust. One of 
the main stresses that keep weakening the ability of the 
city to move forward, as well as the cohesion of Athenian 
society, is mistrust. The city is in the process of becoming 
more open and transparent through opening channels of 
communication, its data and its procedures.

Athens Digital Lab (ADL)

Athens Digital Lab, funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, aims in the 
support and development of start-ups, focused in areas selected by the City 
of Athens, using IoT for “smart cities” technologies. Following an open call, 
teams of young professionals and scientists, and unemployed individuals can 
submit proposals, which in principle will focus on Athens and will provide 
innovative solutions to the basic problems of the city. Athens Digital Lab will 
host the teams for six months, in a fully equipped co-working space, located 
in a brand new municipal building, while providing the necessary field area 
and the necessary data. Executives from the Municipality of Athens high-tech 
companies will act as mentors and will actively participate in the development 
of the solutions, that could be evolved into integrated products. These products 
will be used by the City of Athens, and to then gain access to international and 
national sales channels.

Description: 

Every city in the world is a living organism that constantly 
transforms as it updates its functions. Many factors 
affect the tasks and responsibilities of a city in a broad 
range of sectors. In order for a city to be able to best 
serve its people, there is a need to constantly monitor 
its performance, ideally on a real-time basis. Many cities 
around the world have already developed mechanisms 
and tools that measure their performance using state-
of-the-art digital technologies. Tools such as digital 
and dynamic maps (GIS maps), dynamic databases on 
monitoring indicators, sensors and technologies (Internet 
of Things - IoT) are available for use by any city around 
the world. 

The City of Athens is currently using obsolete technologies 
to measure its performance. This becomes more difficult 
due to insufficient human resources. On the other hand, 
Citizens are also unaware of what is happening in the city, 
while the city decision makers lack the proper tools for 
effective policy making. 

The main objective here is to introduce up to date digital 
technologies to help better manage the City of Athens. 
city officials will thus be able to draft new policies using 
real-time data, while demonstrating to the public, for the 
first time, the dynamic status and performance of the city.  
The latter will be achieved thought a series of actions that 
will promote its transparency.

A.1.1 Digital repository

An effective transition from an analogue to a digital 
era is necessarily supported by the development 
of a Digital Repository that will accumulate the 
analogue and digital information of the city services 
in a single state-of-the-art digital repository. This 
will help city officials and departments gather city 
data in one place in a digitalized format.

The information will be gathered internally but 
will also be supported by data from external 
stakeholders such as Ministries, the Regional 
Authority, ongoing research programs, and 
University studies. 

The main goal of this action is to build the 
foundation of the new digital era of the city. 

Action Owner: City of Athens (Administration in 
collaboration with the CDO)

Partners: Municipal Departments, private and Public 
Organizations that have already implemented 
studies for the city, Ministries, the Region of Attica.

Funding sources: Municipal funds

Time frame: Short-term 

A.1.2 Action plan for transparency and 
accountability 

The aim of this action is to encourage the 
municipality to be more transparent and 
accountable to its residents. The action includes the 
following:

a. Develop a local government scorecard to foster 
transparency and allow for internal and external 
monitoring 

• Create a self-assessment to rate government 

performance at a district level

• Pilot a digital “polling” tool where citizens can rate 

all trust-building events and city services 

b.Launch a data-visualization gallery to promote 

government transparency 

• Make data collected by the city easily accessible 

and understandable 

• Add features that allow for community-influenced 

impact 

• Ask companies that have a stake in user-

centered (UCD) open innovation projects to share 
information and processing methods with users 
and residents. 

c. Establish a digital communications platform with 

an in-person outreach component 

• Make all the relevant action items, due dates, 

parties involved and consequences for inaction 
accessible to the public

• Create a feedback loop for NGOs, civil society,

Time frame: Short-term 

A.1.3  Public works calendar

The City of Athens, capital of the country, is the 
largest municipality in Greece that hosts the central 
core of activities for the whole country. Every day, 
public works are being undertaken across the city 
districts. Utility companies, transport organizations 
and other public or private entities implement 
public works and are obliged to issue a special 
works permit from the city services. 

In many cases these permits are not issued and 
there is ambiguity on type and location. There is 
a need to start tracking these works in a single 
calendar so that all responsible parties are fully 
aware of what is happening. 

This action is about developing an online common 
calendar that will capture all upcoming works, 
as well as potential guidance for the citizens 
(e.g. traffic arrangements). A MoU between the 
Municipality of Athens and the utility companies will 
be signed in order to set the framework. This is a 
first step towards a multilevel digital platform that 
will one day hold all relevant to the city functional 
information.

Action Owner: City of Athens (Deputy Mayor for 
Public Works and ORS)

Partners: Utility companies, Transport 
Organizations, other public work companies (private 
or public) and municipal department.

Funding sources: private donors, structural funds

A.1.4 Fuel management platform and smart waste 
management monitoring system 

The city needs to build an asset and fuel 
management platform, utilizing heavy duty sensors 
in order to measure its assets and provide insight 
to its operational management through the use of 
notifications, alarms and reports. 

This action focuses on two separate activities. 
The first activity is a single management service 
for fuel monitoring of petrol tanks. The city 
will install monitoring sensors in petrol tanks in 
schools for a start and then apply the monitoring 
system to other facilities. The main objective is to 
create a live monitoring system that will provide 
useful information on fuel consumption, create 
a tank registry, keep historical data and provide 
information and reports for future actions.

The second activity is to develop a smart waste 
management system by using sensors on waste 
trucks and bins. That way, the waste management 
department will be able to monitor on a daily basis 
the efficiency of the waste collection system while 
keeping a record of other crucial data such as 
maintenance, future procurements and reports for 
the development of new policies.

Melbourne urban forest strategy
As Cities are facing significant challenges such 
as climate change, population growth and urban 
heating, the city of Melbourne’s sets as a goal in 
its first Urban Forest Strategy to create a resilient, 
healthy and diverse forest for the future that will 
play a critical role in maintaining the health and 
livability of Melbourne.The city of Melbourne 
has undertaken an exceptional tree survey in the 
municipality and produced a register of exceptional 
trees that will be nominated for protection. The aim 
of the register is to recognize, celebrate and protect 
the exceptional trees that exist in the municipality 
in the private realm, which contribute to the urban 
forest and city character as a whole. Building the 
urban forest as a living ecosystem and ensuring 
that it provides the maximum benefits for our 
communities will rely on smart species selection, 
improving soil moisture retention, reducing storm-
water flows, improving water quality and re-use, 
increasing shade and canopy cover, and reducing 
infrastructure conflicts

A.1.5 Tree identity 

The City of Athens currently owns over 120,000 
trees which are growing within the city boundaries. 
There is however no existing registry for these 
trees. city services need to develop an application 
that will help build a register to record all of the 
tree characteristics such as their position, type, 
occupancy, age, classification, and canopy.

The city services have already started to record 
the trees on a GIS map but there is a need to build 
the capacity implement this work. A MoU with 
the Agricultural University of Athens will support 
the project by capitalizing on the expertise of its 
professors and students.

Action Owner: City of Athens (Department of Green 
and Parks)

Partners: Platform Partner, Agricultural University, 
Municipal Department of Green and Parks

Funding sources: Municipal funds

Time frame:  Short-term 

A.1.6 Urban resilience indicators 

Athens has been the center of economic crisis, 
especially local economy, socio-spatial relations, 
and civil unrest. 

The main goal of this action is to develop and 
implement Urban Resilience Indicators as a vehicle 
to map urban social processes in everyday life. 
Omonoia Square, the so-called heart of Athens, is 
an area which has experienced a significant decline 
in commercial activity. This area was used for one 
of our diagnostic activities to better understand 
how it could remain resilient in times of social and 
economic turmoil. 

This action aims to develop a Transferable Toolkit 
that will be extended to other areas of Athens 
in order to connect resilient urban planning 
and decision-making to the needs of Athenian 
neighborhoods.

The existing case study outcomes must be enhanced 
by statistical and sociological methodologies in 
order to make it more robust and transferable.

Communication Campaigns

% !

#

@

?

Description: 

Mistrust towards the central and local government 
constitutes one of the major resilience challenges 
for Athens. Due to the insufficient funding and the 
lack of cohesive structure the city cannot effectively 
communicate its priorities, programs and initiatives 
to the residents. Moreover, Athenians are particularly 
reluctant and dismissive towards municipal endeavors 
due to insufficient information and a lack of thorough 
communication strategies.

The city needs to better communicate its goals and 
actions to the people of Athens. It needs to upgrade 
its information and communication exchange with 
the citizens through the creation of a cross-media 
ongoing campaign, branching out to include a variety of 
stakeholder engagement tools through which the city 
will establish a more open relationship with the public. 
We are in the process of establishing a social media 
campaign focusing on issues related to waste collection 
and the role of the citizens in the city’s cleanliness. The 
social media campaign can be the baseline upon which 
other opportunities for communication and stakeholder 
engagement should be explored and introduced, with 
a focus on different topics such as sustainable mobility 
campaign, promotion of existing social innovation 
platforms implemented by the city, anti-rumor campaign 
for migrants and refugees, gender equality and others.

In order to enhance the resilience of the action, the city’s 
budget should include a percentage for each and every 
one of its projects “invested” in communication with 
the city’s residents. The city therefore needs to create a 
marketing and communications department that is both 
decentralized in the different municipal directorates and 
organizations, but also centralized and able to bring in 
the necessary human, technical and economic resources.

Major public events impact assessment

Description: 

The City of Athens regularly collaborates with partners 
to co-host cultural, sporting, and community events 
across the city. Example events include documenta 14, 
the Athens World Book Capital and Technopolis’ major 
events. 

The city should better understand the spillover effects 
and the economic, social, and environmental impacts 
these events have on the city. 

Athens therefore will develop an evaluation process and 
an assessment tool to understand the aforementioned 
impacts of the city events. The city will design policies 
and strategies based on data and assessment reports, to 
effectively promote its activities.

Digital agenda

Description: 

The Digital Agenda is a set of actions that will enhance 
the use of IT technologies and open new communication 
channels. It includes:

a. Update the back-office internal city services. This 
includes the municipal internal IT systems, e.g. payroll, 
citizen registry and databases. This also includes actions 
such as the digital signature and digital documentation.

b. Improve city services provided to the citizens though 
the municipal portal and the Digital Services Center. This 
includes services that the citizens can have access to from 
their personal computers. Services such as the issuance 
of a certificate, the payment of a fee, the submission of a 
query, and so forth can be provided electronically. 

c. Smart city refers to the development of IT 
technologies used in the public realm. This consists of 
three interrelated activities: expand a Wi-Fi network 
across the city districts, introduce broadband networks 
where possible, and introduce smart sensor monitoring 
system. Innovative and smart city technologies need

Health and social service centers

#

@

Description: 

During the ongoing socio-economic crisis, social service 
needs have increased. This action constitutes a data-
driven and evidence-based solution to the way social 
services and benefits operate, and it will rationalize the 
fragmented and dispersed system through which social 
services are currently being delivered. The variety and 
complexity of the residents’ needs underlines the urgency 
for a holistic approach.

The two components of the Integrated Social Services 
Network are: A) the installation of a Case Management 
System – an online platform for social benefits and 
service applications that allows for digital submission 
assessment, follow-up and feedback for each applicant. B) 
the transformation of one Health Clinic to a Multi-service 
Municipal Centre offering both social and health services.

Currently, the City of Athens is piloting this action 
through the operation of the Municipal Health Centre at 
Chanion Str. (6th city district) as a Multi-social Service 
Centre. This center provides services such as Medical 
Care, Psychosocial Support Services, Job Instruction 
and Legal Support. The pilot operation of an Information 
Technology System connects beneficiaries with other 
services (information and referral system and case 
management).

In the health sector, the centers could provide accessible 
healthcare throughout the city, focusing on diagnostic 
tests and primary care. Each center will cater specifically 
to the needs of the surrounding community, including 
primary care services, first aid and health education 
programs.

Map of the public realm 

% !

#

@

Description: 

There is a strong ambition to improve the public realm 
in Athens and to increase the use of public space by its 
citizens. Currently, public spaces are downgraded and 
poorly maintained due to insufficient resources and 
planning. Additionally, the illegal occupation of public 
space constitutes a continuous challenge for Athenians 
and affects their quality of life.

The City of Athens will map all public open space areas 
across the city in order to create a dynamic registry and 
to have an overview and understanding of what currently 
occupies the public space (vehicles, street furniture, 
tables and chairs, trees, etc.). The city wants to identify 
any obstacles that make the city less walkable and 
appealing.  This exercise will set the baseline for a public 
realm strategy and will help the city understand how 
these spaces can be improved.  

This exercise will set the baseline for a public realm 
strategy and will help the city understand how these 
spaces can be improved and how an effective control 
system can be established. A special group consisting on 
major city architects and urban planners has already been 
assembled in order to advise the Mayor and propose 
solutions for public space design and usage, starting with 
the historic and commercial center of Athens.

Goal C

Foster collaboration and engagement

The City of Athens has managed to survive the recent socio-
economic crisis by forging collaborations among the public, 
private and civic sectors. This is an increasingly important 
aspect of city governance and it is absolutely crucial in 
forging city resilience. This collaboration encourages 
innovation and is a key aspect of effective city governance. 
In order to foster resilience, the existing and proposed 
initiatives have to be streamlined, upscaled and replicated. 
Assessing and evaluating their impact will be a significant 
step towards a robust and integrated city fabric.

Thematic stakeholder platforms 

Description: 

The city recognized the need to create a platform that 
includes all of the CSOs and NGOs dealing with health 
and social services, in order to better communicate to 
the municipal departments which outside partners are 
available to assist with the citizens needs. Therefore, the 
city launched the Social Integration Initiative (SII) that 
now has more than 160 registered organizations offering 
health and social services. The civil employees can refer 
to the platform in order to determine which services are 
most appropriate to meet the needs of the beneficiaries 
in case the city does not meet these needs. 

This platform could be further expanded so as to include 
other services provided by the city such as partners in the 
private sector that can support the cities entrepreneurial 
initiatives and research and other partners related 
to greening the city. Additionally, organizations and 
municipal departments could provide updates on 
activities and open stable channels of communication 
through the SII platforms.

In order to achieve greater dissemination and effective 
impact of these platforms, a crowd-sourcing element 
should be added. NGOs, research centers and other 
organizations that wish to connect with the relevant 
municipal departments will have the opportunity to 
register directly.

synAthina platform

% !

#

Description: 

In July 2013 the City of Athens launched the awarded 
synAthina platform in order to establish a permanent 
and effective link between its services and the Athenian 
NGOs as well as the informal grassroots groups. This 
is a platform where citizen groups can connect with 
each other and suggest activities that contribute to the 
improvement of the quality of life for the Athenians. 

synAthina is a common space that brings together, 
supports and facilitates citizens’ groups engaged in 
improving the quality of life in the city. By coordinating 
the invaluable resource of the citizens’ groups, the City 
of Athens actively listens to the needs of its people.. By 
supporting the activities of the citizens the city creates a 
new perception of the relationship between civic society 
and local governance and cultivates their dynamic bond.

The main goal of the platform is to help simplify municipal 
procedures and strengthen citizen participation in the 
decision-making process. It also aims to encourage 
citizens to collaborate and network across all seven 
districts. Moreover, it will suggest educational programs 
and workshops to help co-create solutions that address 
small-scale urban issues.

University and city synergies

Description: 

Several major academic and research Institutions are 
located within city boundaries. Academic stakeholders 
such as professors, students and researchers are 
continually implementing studies and innovative 
projects that address important issues for the City 
of Athens. During the first year of its operations, the 
Office of Resilience and Sustainability met with many 
stakeholders from the academic and research sector, 
and collaborations have already been forged during both 
the city’s diagnostic phase and the Resilience Strategy 
design. 

Up to date, the city has been fostering and encouraging 
such collaborations on an ad hoc basis. Through the 
Athens Development and Destination Management 
Agency and the INNOVATHENS Hub of Innovation and 
Entrepreneurship of Technopolis City of Athens, the city 
has provided new opportunities to young scientists and 
supported startups and incubators. 

The main objective of this action is to establish and 
standardize long-term collaborations with the academic 
and research sector by developing a holistic approach to 
better use this crucial for the city resource.  

This can be achieved by connecting university professors, 
laboratories and students with municipal departments, 
opening two-way channels of communications, co-
organize master classes, events and conferences and 
finally institutionalizing typologies of collaboration that 
will sustain an ongoing dialogue with the academic 
community regarding major municipal endeavors.

Beneficial to the city University synergies should also 
be established directly with the city communities and 
neighborhoods. The Municipality should/could provide 
facilitation and motivation. The ORS together with the 
Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) 
have been developing a framework that sees the 
University as a major actor in community development, 
fostering social and business connections with the people 
that live around Victoria Square and the Kypseli area of 
the 6th District. Encouraging the university to play a more 
active role in shaping the district’s future will be beneficial 
to the university, its students and the area’s residents.

Furthermore, engaging student and young people at 
the community level is beneficial for the entire city. The 
Erasmus Student Network through its contacts with the 
ORS has already been mobilizing, designing up-cycling 
platform that would benefit the large migrant and refugee 
populations of the area as well as a “buddy system” for 
young refugees. The AUEB students are and can be more 
present in “creating” the public spaces and volunteering 
for programs to help the neighborhood, including food 
festivals and a variety of cultural events.

Athens partnership fund

% !

#

@

Description: 

The Athens Partnership was created to benefit Athenians 
by promoting high-impact partnerships between the City 
of Athens and the private sector, and by leveraging the 
resources and strengths of both. Through its non-profit 
fiscal sponsor, New Venture Fund, the Athens Partnership 
supports innovative public programs – in health, 
education, community development and other areas of 
need. The Partnership is an independent, nonpartisan 
entity that relies on contributions from foundations, 
corporations and individuals. 

Through the Athens Partnership, infrastructure projects 
and initiatives are supported in order to strengthen social 
cohesion, economic growth and overall quality of life in 
the city. The Athens Partnership aims to attract donations 
from foundations, businesses and individuals, including 
the Greek Diaspora.

The organization’s operation follows the most modern 
standards of accountability, transparency and 
effectiveness, with a special focus on financing innovative 
and pilot projects that, through modern technology 
transfer, benefit not only the city but also the municipality. 
As an independent organization working between the 
City of Athens and the private sector, it combines the 
strengths of both to the benefit of the Athenian residents 
who are the ultimate beneficiaries.

The Athens Partnership follows the tradition of successful 
models being in operation for many years in other major 
cities, such as London, New York, Los Angeles and 
Melbourne, where nonprofit organizations collaborate 
creatively with municipalities in areas of vital importance, 
such as sustainable development and the fight against 
poverty and the economic crisis. Thus, the Athens 
Partnership has capitalized on the experience we have 
gained and has upgraded the quality of our cooperation 
with all of those who intend to help.

Athens Culture Net

Description: 

The Athenian culture scene is dynamic, diverse and 
exceptionally interesting. Museums, galleries, private 
collections, theaters, performances, and emerging artists 
are all putting their mark on the city’s cultural identity. 
Over the past few years, major institutions have been 
developing successful and innovative projects regardless 
the continuous economic recession. 

The City of Athens created the Athens Culture Net 
(ACN) in order to connect with the city’s major cultural 
institutions. The ACN, operating in partnership with 
the local government, is a network that promotes the 
exchange of ideas, encourages collaboration, and shares 
best practices and resources. This is to to help Athens to 
stand out as a destination of cultural production, creative 
entrepreneurship and social integration. The network 
focuses, in particular, on the potential impact that art 
events can have on public space and urban fabric.

The city will explore ways to promote the ACN and 
enhance its sustainability in the future. The network 
should create added value to the city’s cultural capital, 
promote common strategies between different 
organizations and contribute to the This Is Athens city 
brand. The ACN should gradually open its scope to 
include other cultural institutions. The first step could be 
the adoption of the Small Museums of Athens Network as 
well as smaller and more niche artistic initiatives.

Supporting Actions

Climate change adaptation action plan

 A.1.2. Built environment

Athens is a very densely and anarchically built city 
with an aging building stock, high energy demands 
and low albedo surfaces. The use of sustainable 
materials and bioclimatic design (cool materials, 
shading structures, increase of vegetation) can have 
positive effects on climate change and help protect 
the city’s population. The adaptation measures that 
are suggested cover a wide range of actions. 

The actions to be taken are the following:
a. Regulate new pedestrian streets. (Actions 5.2.1, 
CAAP)
b. Establish a regulatory framework for the use of 
cool and sustainable materials in all municipal public 
works. (Actions 5.2.2, CAAP) 
c. Design and develop shading and natural cooling 
solutions in urban planning and  street furniture. 
(Actions 5.2.3-5.2.4, CAAP)
d. Record and monitor existing underground tunnels 
and develop routes and shelters for the case of 
future extreme heat waves or other crises. (Actions 
5.2.5, CAAP)

Timeframe: Short/Medium-term

A.1.1  Enhance green infrastructure in the city

The City of Athens targets investment into green 
infrastructure and nature-based solutions that could 
improve the city’s microclimate. These solutions 
could also limit the urban heat island effect and 
improve air quality, and reduce the impacts of 
flooding.. To achieve these goals, the actions to be 
taken are the following: 

a.Provide proper maintenance of the existing green 
areas so as to increase their environmental impact, 
and implement new planting in existing green areas 
that belong to the municipality of Athens. (Actions 
5.1.1-5.1.2, CAAP)
b. Enhance green infrastructure in the regeneration 
of public spaces. (Action 5.1.3, CAAP)
c. Design and create “Green Corridors” both within 
the municipality of Athens and on a metropolitan 
scale, in order to improve air circulation and 
walkability. (Actions 5.1.4-5.1.5, CAAP) 
d. Undertake the necessary regulatory procedures 
for establishing new green public spaces in the city. 
(Actions 5.1.6, CAAP)
e. Design and develop pocket parks, parklets, green 
roofs and vertical gardens in public, private and 
abandoned properties. (Actions 5.1.7-5.1.10, CAAP)
f. Enhance small urban framing boxes in school 
playground and develop urban farming in parks, 
public and private lots, roof gardens etc., and 
promote community farming in a municipal green 
area. (Actions 5.1.11, CAAP)

Climate change adaptation action plan

A.1.3 Public health protection

The municipality is responsible for making available 
data and services, to all residents, that contribute 
to the protection and the reduction of the health 
risks related to high temperatures. The Municipality, 
through strategic partnerships and the use of 
new technologies, can ensure the comprehensive 
dissemination of relevant information. The city 
also actively pursues better coordination with the 
relevant government authorities for implementing 
prevention and protection measures for the general 
population.

The actions to be taken are the following:
a. Expand the “cool centers” network so that 
citizens can protect themselves during high 
temperatures. (Actions 5.3.1, CAAP)
b. Establish public water fountains so that the public 
can have access to drinkable water. (Actions 5.3.2, 
CAAP) 
c. Protect air quality through establishing regulatory 
measures for traffic management. (Actions 5.1.3, 
CAAP)

Improve crisis preparedness of municipal 
administration services. (Actions 5.3.4, CAAP)

Major green areas managing authority

Description: 

Many open green areas exist within the Athenian city 
boundaries, which directly need strategic planning for 
their maintenance, management and further development. 
These large areas fall under the jurisdiction of different 
authorities. The City of Athens, the Region of Attica, the 
Ministry of Energy and Environment are some of the key 
players that need to collaborate and commit economic 
and other resources managing these green areas. 

For example, According to the Presidential Decree 
(No.187/16-06-2011) article 3, the Management Authority 
for two major Metropolitan parks, those of Goudi and 
Ilisia, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Energy and 
Environment and more specifically the “Urban, Suburban 
and Metropolitan Areas Planning Directorate.” In a similar 
vein, large areas such as Pedio Areos, Attiko Alsos, 
Elaionas, Zappeion, LofosArditou should be considered 
as high priority spaces for the larger metropolitan area, 
and swiftly establish a) clear juridical authorities, b) 
budget lines and c) realistic, efficient and sustainable 
maintenance and development plans.

The city will initiate the conversation with all the involved 
parties to collaborate with different levels of government 
(Region, Ministry of Energy and Environment, Ministry 
of Culture, Ministry of Finance) in order to be able to 
proceed. This should lead to the creation of a cross 
sectoral managing authority for most of the important 
green spaces in Athens (Pedio Areos, Attiko Alsos, Lofos 
Arditou, Zappeion).

Regarding the other major green areas that fall under 
municipal jurisdiction, the city has to design and 
implement sustainable and realistic plans, in order to 
be able to maintain and develop them. These are urban 
assets that have been underappreciated and under 
monitored. New collaborations should be forged with 
both the private and the civil sectors in order to achieve 
such a goal. The city will start with the revival of the 
National Park and the Hill of Lycabetus, two important 
city landmarks. 

This action will give back to Athenians appealing large 
green open spaces where they can walk, meet with friend, 
exercise, celebrate, bring some nature into their lives, 
let their children play. It will have a direct effect on the 
quality of everyday life as well as the city identity and the 
branding of Athens, gradually attracting more residents 
and maximizing the possibility for capital investments. All 
this is without taking into considerations the enormous 
benefits vis-à-vis the shocks and stresses that climate 
change brings to the city.

Description: 

The idea of moving the stadium of the beloved Athens 
soccer-ball team Panathinaikos away from the center of 
Athens is not new. Several solutions have been discussed 
during the last couple of decades and respective plans 
have drawn and advanced to different stages.

The project regained political and media interest in the 
beginning of April 2017 following a meeting initiated 
by the Greek Prime Minister Mr. Alexis Tsipras with the 
Mayor of Athens Mr. Giorgos Kaminis. The discussion 
which brought back to the forefront the relocation of 
Papathinaikos Stadium to the Goudi area plan.  

The liberation of the densely populated residential area 
of Alexandras Avenue from the nuisance of the traffic 
congestion, noise and generalized unrest that each 
soccer-ball match brings to the neighborhood would be a 
benefit. Adding to this, the plan is to create a large green 
area that connects the stadium lots with the so-called 
“Refugee Buildings” across the Avenue adds significantly 
to its appeal. 

The Refugee Buildings of Alexandras Avenue are an old-
fashioned, almost ramshackle urban formation consisting 
of eight parallelogram-shaped blocks with a total 228 
apartments, very few of which are inhabited today. They 
were built between 1933 and 1935 to host Refugees 
arriving in Athens after the Asia Minor war of 1922. In 
2009 the whole complex was characterized as a listed 
buildings, for their historical, cultural, socio-political 
and architectural heritage value. Today their future use 
is throttled by legislative decisions that have halted any 
further development. 

The plan of connecting via the creation of a large green 
area the two sides of Alexandras Avenue, by submerging 
or lifting above ground part of the Avenue, would bring 
benefits that far succeed the particular area. The densely 
build Athens center is today starving for green open 
spaces that can revive and boost the development of 
the particular neighborhoods, creating jobs, attracting 
investments, but also support Athens’ climate resilience 
mitigating extreme heat, flash floods and bad air quality. 
The same project proposes to design and develop two 
large and largely abandoned green areas that spill over 
several municipalities of the metropolitan area: the Goudi 
Metropolitan Park and the Double Development Area in 
Elaionas. 

Several announcements of different versions of such 
developmental projects have created a negative 
precedent. Due to the chronic delays in advance any of 
these proposals, the conflicting interests of stakeholders, 
as well as the total absence of proper communication and 
consultation channels with the Athenian public, this whole 
proposal should go forth building on a robust process of 
advocacy, municipal diplomacy, stakeholder engagement.

Elaionas: a resilient district 

% !

#

@

Description: 

The urban district of Elaionas is a post-industrial area, 
which is currently regulated to accommodate light 
industrial uses, logistics and crafts. The overall district 
has substantial green open spaces (assigned as such by 
Presidential decree) distributed among the neighborhood 
blocks.

However, the district remains underutilized because of 
lack of critical infrastructures, such as roads, sewage and 
streetscape, political will and investment interest. The 
current situation is to a large extent a result of conflicting 
interests, regulatory hurdles, and a lack of a clear vision, 
that could bring the different levels of government into a 
dynamic collaboration transforming this areas potential 
into an amazing part of the city. Apart from the central 
government administration delaying the implementation 
of critical infrastructure work in the area, the Athens 
municipality has also not completed the required urban 
studies for 30% of the Elaionas (approx. 45 hectares), as 
it also lacks adequate funding for the expropriation the 
provisioned spaces.

The envisioned project includes the revitalization of the 
entire district with a complete transformation, starting 
from the required infrastructures. As the city owns 
substantial land in the area, it is proposed that such real 
estate is utilized to provide (co-)working spaces for the 
creative and clean-tech industries in order to create an 
innovation district, of co-creation, green development 
and clean-tech innovation. The municipality can explore 
the potential for new modes of collaborative city-making 
in a networked society. For example the municipality 
can set the operational, land-use, and environmental 
framework, inviting proposals from Athenian architects, 
urban planners and landscape architects for the design 
of the different lots it owns. The principles will be those 
of innovation, holistic sustainable management (energy 
and waste neutral, high green ration, circular economy, 
etc) and urban well being providing the district with new 
types of sport facilities.

For the initiation of the above vision, the following 
actions/studies are required:

• urban studies for the remaining part of the district (45 

• technical studies for the main infrastructure, under 

hectares)

municipal authority

• strategic and business plan for the utilization of 

municipal real estate and its sustainable development

• collaborative city-making methodology pilot

Waste management action plan

% !

#

@

Description: 

The City of Athens Sanitation Directorate carries out the 
collection of municipal waste. This involves a 24-hour 
service, which operates 365 days a year. Currently there 
are 178 different waste collection programs implemented 
by the Waste Collection Department of the Sanitation 
Directorate. These programs serve the 664,046 
permanent residents of the city and almost 4.000.000  
tourists per year. 

There is a need to develop and implement a Resilient 
Waste Management Action Plan that will include new 
models of waste management tailor-made for Athens. 
The Resilient Waste Management Action Plan will be 
fully aligned with the Local Waste Management Plan 
that was submitted to the Region of Attica. Currently, 
the Resilience and Sustainability Office is in close 
collaboration with the Mayor, the General Secretary and 
the Deputy Mayor for Waste Management creating a new 
and improved Operational/Business Plan. In parallel, the 
Resilience Office asked from ARUP (our Strategy Partner) 
to develop a waste study (assessment of existing state 
of affairs and proposed future actions) and organized a 
problem-framing workshop in collaboration with 100RC 
Platfrom Partner,citymart. The results of these two 
studies, together with the development of a Modeling 
and Mapping Tool in collaboration with Findyr (100RC 
platform partner) consist the basis for the development 
of a Resilient Waste Management Action Plan.

B.1.3 Design and enhance stakeholder engagement 
in waste management

During the implementation of Phase II of the 
Resilient Athens Program, the collaboration with 
citymart and ARUP has provided new innovative 
proposed solutions in waste management. Citizens 
must play a crucial role to help improve the process 
of waste collection and city cleanliness. Waste and 
cleaning of the city are the most important aspects 
of the everyday life of the Athenians and measures 
need to be taken by both the city services and the 
citizens. 

stakeholder stakeholder engagement action 
plan will be designed in order to support the 
communication and awareness campaigns, together 
with the supportive actions that will take place in 
parallel.

Funding sources: Municipal funds

Time frame: Short-term

B.1.1  Efficient waste management logistics

The City of Athens currently has limited resources 
to keep the city clean. The economic crisis has 
led to public budget cuts, more bureaucratic and 
time-consuming public procurement, as well as 
reductions in staffing. As a result, current waste 
management and cleaning service programs are 
inefficient and in a state of continual crisis. 

The city needs to improve its logistics by combining 
the purchase of new equipment and the efficient 
management of equipment, human resources and 
available budget. The local waste management 
action plan proposes several logistics actions such 
as the development of a waste transfer station.

B.1.2. Design a forward-looking and innovative 
recycle and reuse program for athens 

The Recycle and Reuse Program in Athens is not 
working properly. Several problems, such as lack of 
bins, broken trucks and lack of human resources, 
have reduced the capacity of the recycling 
programs in Athens. On the other hand, the 
collaboration with the Hellenic Recovery Recycling 
Corporation (He.r.r.Co) is under evaluation by both 
parties, and even though the contract between the 
parties is overdue there is a need to redefine the 
scope of work towards a more efficient Recycling/
Reuse Program.

This action includes also the development of 
integrated “Green” Points in the city. These points 
will directly alleviate the current collection and 
transportation problems.

B.1.4 Incorporate data provided by the city on a

B.1.5 Value and job creation through circular econ-
omy 

This action is emerging from the need the city has 
for open and digital data. As mentioned in the 
previous actions, performance monitoring of many 
city activities is crucial, and that is especially true 
for the waste management and cleaning services 
of the city. Currently, city services monitor the 
performance through analogue data and hard 
copies. Due to the lack of capacity, this monitoring 
is insufficient and many times with no results. 

The main objective is to digitalize the whole process 
and to targetg two main areas. The first goal is to 
develop new data-driven policies and the second is 
to demonstrate the performance of the city’s waste 
management services to the citizens.

Time frame: Short-term

The circular economy provides solutions for 
many environmental, economic and geopolitical 
challenges that cities worldwide are facing. It 
provides the next step in resilience building, as it 
transforms waste into critical resources. 

Athens should do an opportunity mapping in 
order to identify which of its sectors can make 
the most impact in: value creation, job creation, 
better air quality and reduction in CO2 emissions, 
competitiveness in global markets, and reduction 
in resource use. It seems like our household waste 
system, and specifically our organic waste chain, 
could be a potential driver for the transition to 
circularity, i.e. one of the sectors that we could 
focus on in order to develop innovative strategies 
on how to extract value and create jobs.

ISOCARP urban planning seminar - Envisioning 
Future Cities: Athens 

Architects and urban designers should respond to this constant evolution and 
transformation by developing architectural and urban systems that allow for 
flexibility – permitting structure, programs and use to adapt and change based 
on shifting needs over time. Design questions in Athens must be approached 
in the expectation that the city will reshape itself throughout its life, building 
resilience into the development model as a result. Crucially, this adaptive 
perspective will allow for different modes of intervention in different conditions, 
whether stable or fleeting.

A seminar will be organized by ISOCARP and Resilient Athens during 2017 with 
13 local urban planners/architects and 13 members of ISOCARP (HABITAT 3 
Urban Agenda)

Sustainable mobility roadmap 

Description: 

Currently, there is a high dependency on cars to move 
around the city. There is limited public transportation 
infrastructure and therefore an increase in traffic 
congestion and poor air quality. In order to address these 
challenges, the Athens Mobility Forum will be responsible 
for leading the process of implementing Athens 
Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP). 

The Forum could eventually evolve into the Athens 
Mobility Agency which would be the governing body for 
the delivery of the SUMP. It can ensure that the plan is 
coordinated with all the relevant stakeholders across all 
city scales.

The main objectives of the Athens Mobility Forum are the 
following:

1. Institutional framework and governance
2. Multi-scale approach to urban mobility
3. Holistic and multimodal approach to urban mobility
4. Incremental implementation of a mobility plan

The first steps to be taken by the Municipality are 
described in the supporting actions.

C.1.2 Urban cycling plan

The Urban Cycling plan is designed consistently with 
the Regional Cycling plan, which is currently being 
implemented across several municipalities in the 
Attica Region. The Region of Attica has allocated 
a budget of 10 million Euros for the construction of 
the north axis of a cycling lane which is currently in 
progress. 

Following the development of the North axis that 
connects Gazi to Kifisia, the Urban Cycling plan 
suggests the following actions:

• Promote cycling in the Athens Historical and 

• Create new cycle lanes that connect the basic 

Commercial Triangle

North and South axes

• Create new parking lots for bicycles
• Implement communication and information 

campaigns for younger ages

• Incorporate bicycle in the touristic development of 

the city

Crowd-sourcing has been successfully used as an 
online problem solving and production model that 
presents great potential in the area of bicycle route 
planning. It taps into the collective intelligence of 
networked communities to co-create and support 
local policies and programs, as well as improve 
community engagement. We suggest that the first 
bicycle routes designed for the center of Athens 
should also take in to consideration the desires and 
proposals that the city will crowd-source through 
an open call to the Athens bicycle communities.

Description: 

Athens’ public space has been heavily neglected over 
the past few years. The city is currently developing new 
strategies aiming at revitalizing and regenerating these 
areas. One of them is the OPANDA initiative Culture 
Defeats Darkness that supports and brings cultural 
activities to heavily degraded urban areas. The end goal 
of this initiative is to regenerate depressed areas by 
bringing back the life to their public spaces. The city will 
upscale this methodology in depressed but liveable areas 
such as Victoria square and parts of Kypseli district. This 
will include a series of performances, cultural events, and 
small-scale cultural interventions supported by digital 
technologies. The project will be enforced by synergies 
between major cultural organizations in order to 
maximize its visibility and success.  The action builds on 
this belief in order to cultivate a new approach for Athens; 
public space and to enforce the productive collaborations 
between the municipal government and city’s cultural 
organizations.

Public space co-development 
framework

% !

#

@

Description: 

Athens’ public space has been heavily neglected over the 
past few years. Well-maintained streets, curbs, sidewalks, 
lighting, transit stations, parks and facilities signal a sense 
of well-being and municipal responsiveness that needs to 
be restored in the mind of Athenians.

The city will draft and implement a policy regarding 
the maintenance of public space that will take into 
consideration the limited municipal funds as well as 
Athens’ human capital. We will develop an action 
framework that will combine several Trans-Atlantic 
Policy Lab (TAPL) proposals along with two EU funding 
proposals (Urban Innovative Action and ICT-11-2017 
“Collective awareness platform for sustainability and 
social innovation”) in order to foster collaborations 
around public space maintenance and co-creation, and to 
catalyze participatory activities in the city. 

The action framework will be based on the following 
project ideas:

1. We Are Athens Initiative: 

Launch the We Are Athens initiative to beautify the 3rd 
and 6th districts and support the long-term maintenance 
of public space. We Are Athens seeks to develop a sense 
of community responsibility by empowering residents, 
visitors, homeowners, renters, business owners and 
NGOs to define the quality of life in their communities 
and establish a culture that supports the maintenance of 
public space.

2. Athens Creates program:

The Athens Creates program aims to embed art into 
public space, which proposes a creative placemaking 
program that promotes public life in the 3rd and 6th 
districts. Athens Creates is composed of a series of 
temporary placemaking interventions that are hands-on 
and participatory. Given the municipality’s limited budget, 
temporary interventions will produce the best results.

Action Plan has already been drafted. Next, the city 
needs to form a Food Council, invite stakeholders, open 
the dialogue and define the Council’s function within the 
administration. We want the Council to set the framework 
for a sustainable food system in our city. The Council will 
facilitate the dialogue between the civil society and the 
Municipality’s decision-making bodies in the three food 
focal areas: production, distribution and appreciation of 
good food. The goal is to ensure urban food resilience 
as well as nutritional education and security, support 
and enhance the blooming food entrepreneurship 
and tourism in Athens, connect with peri-urban food 
producing municipalities, procure green food and 
minimize food waste across all steps of the metabolism of 
the city.

D.1.2 Develop Varvakeios downtown food market

Varvakeios Food market is an incredible asset to the 
city Center and it represents the Food Policy Plan 
Flagship. Making it a beautiful and vibrant Athenian 
Food Hub can be easily envisaged. It is currently in 
decay and disarray. The City of Athens will design 
a refurbishment plan, which includes a restoration 
plan for the old train-station-looking building 
(early 1900) and the surrounding area including 
Varvakeios square, and a feasibility, logistics and 
management plan regarding its shop owners. 
Varvakeios Food Hub is an entrepreneurial node 
involving all aspects related to food. At the moment, 
its basic operation is retail food selling. This could 
be enhanced so that Varvakeios becomes a 24-
hour cultural and tourism center combined with the 
multifaceted thematic of food.

D.1.4 School street market pilot project 

The City of Athens has been addressing food 
poverty through municipal solidarity structures 
such as KYADA (City of Athens Hospitality and 
Solidarity Center) and a robust set of social welfare 
policies. And while in 2012 the eligible applicants 
for food support were around 7000 people, today 
there are around 25,000 people who receive a food 
basket or food coupons weekly.  In addition to the 
municipal efforts, there is a significant bottom-up 
movement of SCOs and NGOs that today provide 
food and food-related services, including Boroume 
which up-cycles leftover food. 

The City of Athens will build a strategy that reduces 
significantly food waste, with a 2050-zero-food-
waste target.

Time frame: Medium-term to Long-term

In a municipality with high unemployment and 
elevated rates of child poverty, schools can play 
a crucial role in improving social equity and labor 
market innovation. Food can serve as an anchor 
for action-based, intercultural and cross-class 
learning experiences, especially when street 
markets are employed as a means to encourage 
exchange. A unique opportunity exists to leverage 
the municipality’s rich food culture, the historical 
urban fabric, intellectual and artistic professional 
culture and innovative school policies in order to 
open school grounds to the community. This project 
improves the well-being of children in the target 
districts and builds long-term skills through self-
organized forms of learning. 

Key activities include:  a. Organize a School Street 
Market Team to plan and advance a School Street 
Market Pilot Project b. Use everyday objects (food) 
and everyday practices (a street market exchange) 
to situate lessons within place-based education 
c. Involve local leaders and civic associations in 
developing employment prospects for students still 
at school.

@

Description: 

The City of Athens has joined the global efforts of cities 
to mitigate climate change and reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHG). The Climate Change Mitigation Action 
Plan (CMAP) focuses on actions that aim at reducing 
energy consumption at the city level. The City of Athens 
has developed a GPC-compliant GHG emissions inventory, 
using 2014 as baseline year, through analyzing municipal, 
residential and commercial energy consumption. This also 
includes transportation, solid waste management and all 
related emissions. The greenhouse gas emissions were 
estimated at 5,069,040 tons of CO2equivalent which is 
equal to 7.63t/capita. The reduction target set is 40% 
reduction in GHG by 2030. Furthermore, the measures 
taken to mitigate climate change offer wider benefits to 
the city, such as financial (deriving from the reduction of 
energy costs) and social (deriving from job creation and 
protection of vulnerable population).

Climate change mitigation action plan

E.1.1  Municipal buildings and public lighting

a. The City of Athens owns and is responsible for the 
maintenance of over 1000 buildings. Most of them 
have been constructed in the period 1960-1990 
and lack thermal insulation resulting in high energy 
demands. The City of Athens has implemented and 
will continue to implement energy retrofits and 
soft energy-saving actions within its buildings to 
improve efficiency and reduce energy costs. The 
use of Renewable Energy Systems on buildings is 
also another important factor for reducing GHG 
emissions. (Action 6.1.1., CMAP)

b. The city is upgrading street lighting, replacing 
the existing 25-year-old network, with LED 
technology. Municipal street lighting network 
covers 930km in the city expanding over 3300 
streets. It corresponds to 66% of the total annual 
municipal electric energy consumption. The number 
of luminaires is estimated at 45000. The City of 
Athens is currently conducting a photo-technical 
study on the street lighting. (Action 6.1.2.,CMAP)

Action Owner: City of Athens (Relevant departures 
and ORS)

Partners: C40, platform partners, universities and 
research centers, private sector

Funding sources: NSRF, Municipal funds, private 
donors

Time frame: Short-term (ongoing)

E.1.2 Commercial and residential sector

a. The City of Athens will establish dedicated 
campaigns to raise citizens’ environmental 
awareness, encouraging them to cut costs by 
reducing their energy consumption at home. 
Statistical studies have revealed that 85,9% of the 
thermal energy consumed is used for heating, while 
67,3% of the electrical energy used is spent on 
household appliances. Educational campaigns in 
schools will continue through seminars/workshops, 
leaflets, interactive communication focusing on 
children, their information and awareness regarding 
their carbon footprint. (Action 6.2.1., CMAP)

b. Support, promote and disseminate information 
regarding national energy saving programs. The 
program “ENERGY SAVING AT HOME” initiated in 
2011, has already improved the energy efficiency 
of 40.000 houses. The City of Athens will promote 
national funding programs regarding energy 
savings. Such programs can lead to significant 
energy efficiency in the residential sector, reach 
up to 44% of the final energy used. (Action 6.2.2., 
CMAP) 

c. Increase the use of natural gas for heating 
demand in residential buildings. Currently diesel 
is the dominant choice of fuel used for heating 
demands in residential buildings. Assuming that 
30% of Athenian building will be connected to 
the natural gas grid through the National Savings 
Programs mentioned above, the City of Athens- 
in cooperation with the natural gas suppliers – will 
implement awareness raising activities, aiming at 
steering the remaining households towards energy 
efficiency. Choosing natural gas over diesel for 
heating demands could save up to 20% in total 
energy consumption in the residential sector of 
Athens. (Action 6.2.3., CMAP)

d. Promote nearly zero-energy buildings. The City 
of Athens will support in any possible way the 
conversion of 10% of the existing residential sector 
to nearly zero-energy-buildings until 2030. The 
City of Athens would like to become the point of 
reference for citizens seeking advice on this topic.

Climate change mitigation action plan

e. Climate Change Mitigation actions: a. increase 
green areas in low-green Athenian Districts, b. 
ameliorate local bioclimatic conditions through the 
use of cool materials, c. include shading elements 
throughout public areas. The above actions will 
have a significant effect in the reduction of air-
conditioning use as cooling devices during the 
hottest of months. (Action 6.2.5., CMAP)

f. Establish a municipal fund for energy upgrading 
of residential buildings.  The City of Athens will 
establish a municipal fund that assists residents to 
implement energy upgrading of their buildings and 
cut costs. Its efforts will be based on the example 
of the “Prosopsi” facades regeneration program 
that managed to renovate 4000 building facades 
in the first decade of the 21st century. If the City 
of Athens provides funds for energy upgrades to 
24.000 households until the year 2030, energy 
demands can be cut to 27% per residence. (Action 
6.2.6., CMAP)

g. Advocate for the benefits of energy savings, 
targeting entrepreneurs. This measure addresses 
the tertiary sector. Up to 8.000 buildings have 
been recorded as hosting entrepreneurial activities 
in the City of Athens. The program “Building the 
Future,” running under the Ministry of Environment 
and Energy, aims at the reduction of energy 
consumption in the tertiary sector. The City 
of Athens supporting this effort, will organize 
information campaigns on the benefits of energy 
savings, through ADDMA. (Action 6.2.7., CMAP)

h. Implementing Measures for energy savings in 
industry, which however has only a 3% contribution 
to the Athenian GHG emissions. (Action 6.2.8.,

a. By replace 20% of the existing old, diesel-fuel 
municipal fleet with new    technology vehicles 
by 2030, the municipality could achieve a 20% 
reduction of costs from fuel consumption. (Action 
6.3.1., CMAP)

b. The municipality will communicate and advocate 
for the benefits of eco-driving to the administration 
staff of relevant departments. residents of the City. 
(Action 6.3.2., CMAP)

c. Improve management and efficiency of the 
municipal fleet by using new technologies and 
rationalizing the existing routes. (Action 6.3.3., 
CMAP)

d. The municipality has commissioned a Sustainable 
Mobility Action Plan that aims at reducing the 
presence of cars in the city center, which would 
bring significant benefits regarding the mitigation 
of GHG emissions. (Action 6.3.4., CMAP)

a. Waste management contributes the 7% to 
the city’s GHG emissions. The City of Athens is 
developed a more sustainable strategic plan for 
waste management having as a target the 100% 
diversion of organic waste away from landfills by 
2030. This action is one of the most significant, in 
respect to its contribution to emissions reduction 
in the City of Athens and to our target of 40% 
reduction of GHG emissions by 2030. (Action 6.4.1.,

Energy poverty mitigation roadmap

Description: 

Energy poverty tends to become one of the biggest social 
problems in Europe. Greece is no exception. According 
to a recent study almost 25% of Athenian households 
suffer from energy poverty due to the economic crisis 
and are unable to cover their basic domestic needs. These 
households are unable to afford any heating during the 
winter and live in indoor temperatures that do not exceed 
6 to 7 degrees Celsius in the cold winter months. 

The City of Athens will implement measures for energy 
poverty elimination at city level and will develop 
programs to alleviate the most vulnerable populations 
suffering from energy poverty.

Renewable energy cooperatives

% !

#

@

Description: 

According to the European Commission, in France, Spain, 
Croatia and even Greece citizens have started to invest 
in renewable energy cooperatives, but different legal 
contexts and lack of support mechanisms mean they still 
lag far behind northern European countries. 

The depressed macroeconomic conditions in Greece, 
energy poverty and the lack of social cohesion could 
be mitigated by the creation of energy cooperatives 
in the form of either a social cooperative or a business 
association. 

The main objective of this program is to enable the City 
of Athens to facilitate the development of either energy 
cooperatives at a neighborhood level or larger resident 
consortium, by recognizing potential legal and other 
barriers proposing and helping citizens to overcome 
them. 

The Resilience and Sustainability Office will bring together 
experts and researchers from the public and private 
sectors in order to assess and promote the development 
of Renewable Energy Cooperatives.

Description: 

Athens has experienced numerous crises over the 
centuries. The City of Athens recognizes the need to 
preparing for crisis and having plans in place during 
emergencies. In order to design a strategic approach 
for crisis preparedness and management we are in 
contact with several research centers and governmental 
authorities that will guide us through the process. 

Our office will collaborate closely with a team of 
Professors and their Graduate Students from the 
Harokopeio University Postgraduate Program “Applied 
Geography and Spatial Planning: Management of Natural 
and Human Induced Hazards.” In the context of their 
practical training, the student team will help the office 
to coordinate a series of stakeholders who will, through 
MoUs, paid or unpaid services, will help Athens come up 
with a forward looking innovative strategic plan.

Description: 

Athens Resilience Strategy is guided by the principles 
of data-driven and forward-looking policymaking. It is 
a policy framework that will allow Athens to look more 
successfully forward, taking into consideration the critical 
shocks and stresses, and make the best use of critical 
resources and services as the city transforms through time. 

One of the main objectives of this endeavor has been 
to embed the logic and practices of resilience into 
the systems of the city. Engaging elected and the 
administrative staff in scenario-based exercises is one of 
the most effective way to inform and change mindsets 
around policy making. The Municipality will develop 
policymaking protocols, framed by different scenarios of 
what might happen to our city, based on forward-looking 
data collection and development.

Together with experts and the city administrators, we 
will start by considering different shocks and stresses 
scenarios, in order to prioritize, medium term actions 
of the strategy. The scenarios will be designed by 
universities and research centers in collaboration with the 
relevant municipal departments and with the help of the 
100RC Risks and Assets tool.

Metropolitan authority and other 
legislative and policy making reforms

Description: 

The City of Athens, the seat of national government, 
and the center of all major commercial and cultural 
activity have been strongly advocating for Metropolitan 
Governance to can ensure efficiency and effectiveness 
of governance in a city like Athens. Metropolitan 
Governance means a clear division of responsibilities and 
jurisdictions between the different levels of government: 
Central government, through the ministries, Regional and 
Decentralized authorities and Local municipal government. 
The cross-juridical and overlapping authorities complexities 
make it often very hard to serve citizens. We need discrete 
functions and transparent relations. The objective is a 
unified management that organizes all the jurisdictions and 
functions relating to life in large cities and the needs of the 
citizens, in the most efficient and effective way using the 
principle of subsidiary. 

The above is a long-term aim that involves years of 
advocacy and effort. In the short term however, the City 
of Athens will design and champion specific legislative 
reforms that are crucial for city’s survival in the coming 
years. Those reforms address the challenging financial and 
social environment of Athens legislation, helping the city to 
adapt and be more flexible in times of challenge. 

The legal department will issue a study for legislative 
proposals in order to ensure that the city can fully fulfill its 
functions. The key areas of focus:

1. Create the possibility of a municipal time-bank for 
exchanging/bartering goods and services on the level of 
the city districts.

2. Re-adjust the municipal taxation system in order to be 
able to provide specific incentives or disincentives to local 
entrepreneurs and Athenians in general.

3. Provide the ability to develop a crowd sourcing and 
crowd funding system for supporting municipal projects 
and services.

4. Provide a legal framework for spatial and temporal 
land use within city jurisdiction. This reform will permit 
temporary activities and interventions in vacant lots.    

5. Provide the right to municipalities to facilitate and 
provide digital access to labor coupons (ergosimo). The 
labor coupons will enable the City of Athens’ periodical 
extra-work platform a measure that mitigates the black 
economy while allowing people to increase their wages.

Goal A

Enhance planning in the face of

6. Re-adjust the legal framework regarding the sex 
workers and brothels licensing: Today in Athens none of 
the brothels are legal as the processes regarding their 
licensing are exorbitant and unrealistic which leaves 
all the sex workers in the city without social and health 
benefits.

7. Real-Estate Property Taxation allocated to the 
Municipalities: This is a long standing proposal that will 
liberate from its economic dependency to the central 
government, linking its budget directly to the citizens that 
it serves.

8. Issue kinder garden Permits for Home Day Cares: The 
limited capacity of municipal kinder gardens to cover 
the needs of the most vulnerable populations can be 
significantly supported by the creation of family day cares 
which today are not an option as there is no regulatory 
framework that can legitimize such activities.

9. Participatory Budgeting Regulatory Framework: 
Develop the ability for city districts to decide how to 
manage and distribute a specific percentage of the 
municipal budget.

Description: 

In the light of a potential shock and/or chronic stresses 
such as climate change, the city should use data to assess 
and address its weaknesses and be prepared for prevention 
and protection. Athens has identified five areas that require 
detailed resilience studies. The following resilience related 
studies will be commissioned to universities or/and other 
relevant researchers throughout public tender process:

a) A hydro-geological assessment of Athenian subsoil 
(underground streams, aquifer)

b) A register of underground passages and tunnels using 
topographical surveying

c) A traffic and transport study for the center of Athens, 

d) A study of Athenians’ mobility patterns using geo-
location of mobile phones (without impinging on issues of 
privacy) 

e) A critical networks food and fuel logistics study focusing 
on urban resilience (on the lines of “who feeds Athens” and 
“who fuels Athens”)

This action will be implemented with the collaboration of 
universities and research centers. These critical studies will 
allow foreseeing challenges before they occur and creating 
the basic knowledge that can support forward looking 
policies and actions.

Old building retirement

Description: 

The City of Athens around the late 1950’s witnessed an 
immense growth of population resulting in a golden era for 
the building sector. The majority of the Athenian building 
stock was produced between 1960 and 1980 and is of very 
poor quality. Today a great number of these buildings have 
aged and unsafe structural elements as well as low energy 
efficiency behaviour. They have not incorporated the 
regulatory guidelines for the Greek Building Code (in effect 
from 1985 and their increasing energy demands add to the 
cities GHG emissions having dire environmental effects. 
Since 2001 we have a revised New Seismic Code and this 
year (2017) we are expecting the new Energy Efficiency 
Code that will regulate all new construction, aligning us 
with the relative EU directives

Athens, a city struggling with strong UHI effects and 
heat waves yearly as well as high percentages of energy 
poverty among its populations (25-28%) needs strict 
energy efficient design criteria for zero-energy or low-
energy buildings. Athens is also a city under the threat of 
serious earthquakes. The time is right for a robust building 
retirement code followed by a new land use regulatory 
framework that increases open and green spaces. This 
will drive forth the reconstruction/economy of the city, 
renew the identity of the city, ameliorate the quality of life 
in the city and greatly increase the city’s resilience. The 
city is in dire need of new open and green spaces. Without 
the capacity to retire and demolish old buildings (whole 
blocks of buildings) and create open green spaces the city 
is going to continue being vulnerable to is most serious 
threats.

The City of Athens has already identified around 500 
buildings at the city center (University of Thessaly study) 
that could be prioritized, is working with legal experts in 
order to introduce the necessary legal reforms, and will be 
developing a strategic financial plan for expropriations and 
old building retirement as well as instruments of financial 
investment. This is an essential action and should be 
prioritized.

Workshops for promoting resilience 
Conference for Athens 

The city will organise a conference with municipal administrators and elected 
officials, representatives from the academic community as well as from the 
non-profit sector and the civil society in order to introduce the concept of the 
Municipal Neighborhood Network to key stakeholders and facilitate the best 
possible procedure and methodology for its creation.

The mistrust towards the public sector and the municipal administration and 
political authority has been defined as one of the major challenges for the 
resilience of Athens. The city recognizes that an efficient, interactive and 
transparent network can help evaluate the level of existing services as well 
collect and implement new projects identified by different stakeholders. 

During the Conference for Athens, the city district councils, the municipal 
departments and the political leadership will focus on specific resilient 
challenges of the city like the possible creation of a neighborhood watch 
program and the introduction of a feasible action plan for initiating a 
participatory budget in the municipality.

Municipal neighborhood network

Description: 

A recurring challenge for the Municipality is the 
communication gap between the city and its residents. 
The city recognizes that an efficient, interactive and 
transparent network that spreads throughout the city 
can help evaluate the level of existing services as well 
collect and implement new projects identified by different 
stakeholders. 

City of Athens aims to create an offline as well as online 
network that connect the political and administrative 
sector with the citizens at the neighborhood level. 
Athenians will be able to connect and interact with nodes 
of this network regarding their everyday life in the city. 
The goal is for the municipal authorities to help address 
the citizens daily challenges as well as to capitalize on 
the opportunities that different individuals and groups of 
people bringing to the city. 

The proposed structure will be developed in the level of 
the seven city districts and their neighborhoods. The city 
will strive to find the best way to be present on the ground 
thought a political ambassador and city representatives.

Building an efficient, interactive and transparent network 
can be a major catalyst for development, collection, 
evaluation and implementation of opportunities, efforts 
and offers of various stakeholders (from universities and 
institutions to private donors and citizens collectives). 

The network should be closely linked with municipal 
networks/projects like synAthina and Schools Open to 
the Neighborhood in order to maximize the impact to the 
city. Moreover, the role of the Office for Resilience and 
Sustainability, as a facilitator to this whole system can be 
significant here. 

66% of the citizens have not been in contact with 
municipal services and 31% of the citizens have been 
in the last 12 months. 79% cases were accomplished 
and 20% did not.

Municipal capacity building

#

@

?

Description: 

The continuous recession and budget cuts as well as 
a chronic lack of dependable data and the abounding 
bureaucratization of the public sector has created a climate 
of resentment and mistrust towards municipal employees 
and the city as a public. Moreover, the lack of transparency, 
absence of robust channels of communication, and 
ineffective and without continuity implementation of public 
consultation has contribute to the general belief that local 
authority is insufficient, unqualified and ill-equipped and 
often corrupted.

During the last few years, there have been steps made 
towards opening the decision-making processes 
of the municipal authorities to the Athenians, some 
more successful than others. Still, a vast majority of 
the population believes that there is no participatory 
decision making in Athens.  The most crucial is the lack of 
communication between different parts of the municipality 
regarding activities and decisions as well as their 
communication to the districts and to the citizens. 

To address this, the city will develop a capacity building 
program for participatory governance to be rolled out 
within the city administration and across city district 
councils. This action will be done in collaboration with a 
platform partner and will focus on developing a toolkit 
to facilitate the management and dissemination of 
information between the city leadership, city district 
councils, and citizens. 

The city will: 

a. Create a program to update the municipal skills in 
participatory decision-making. This will include holding 
seminars and workshops on the subject matter. 

b. Launch Athens Municipality Serves, a series of virtual 
and in person platforms and actions aimed at changing 
how public officials interact with residents, in an effort 
to earn the trust of residents and build confidence in 
government and its services.

c. Use the C40: Capacity Building for Carbon Disclosure, 
a series of seminars building capacity among the 
administration staff on greenhouse gas emissions data 
development and collection, as a model for a series of

Goal C

Engage with our neighborhoods

An "open city" is a city that listens to its people. Athens has 
been trying to create structures of participatory governance, 
built on bottom-up informed policy making. This is what will 
make city governance more relevant, fair and trustworthy. 
Apart from the Districts that have to be supported and 
reinforced as administrative units, the sub-category of the 
Athenian neighborhood is still meaningful as a loose type 
of community and mode of belonging. The proposed action 
will empower our neighborhood, fostering dialogue and 
participatory governance.

Learning from Athens

The Schools open to the Neighborhood initiative is, in a small number of schools, 
coupled with Designed for Better Learning project. Through DBL project, 
a collaboration between the city, the University of Crete and the Niarchos 
Foundation, 11 school units in Athens were redesigned, in order a) to improve 
educational outcomes and b) to reclaim and prove the value of schools for 
community engagement by using participatory design technics and processes. 
DBL focuses on classrooms and common areas, including recreation spaces and 
teachers’ lounges.  The city will examine further funding possibilities to expand 
this imitative in a greater number of schools.

Schools open to the neighborhood 

Description: 

The city has recognized that there is an opportunity to use 
school buildings to host community events. This is a way 
of maximizing the use of buildings across the city and to 
help enhance community networks. The aim of the “Schools 
Open to the Neighborhood“ initiative is to host crowd-
sourced by the neighborhood people activities, accessible 
to all Athenians, within school premises during after-school 
hours and weekends. 

School buildings become vibrant centers of activity for 
the community and students, teachers, parents, and 
residents are all invited to participate in education, cultural, 
athletic, and entertainment activities. The program also 
provides cleaning services and guards to monitor the area 
during the hours of operation. It includes maintenance 
works on participating schools such as graffiti removal, 
mending fences and installing safer, new court surfaces in 
schoolyards.

To date, over 2,554 Athens residents have signed up and 
currently 64 different activities are offered across the city.

Migration integration action plan

% !

#

?

Description: 

In the summer of 2015, Athens was faced with the short-
term challenge of finding temporary solutions in order to 
provide food, shelter and health care to large number of 
refugees arriving at or passing through the city. This was 
a tremendous challenge for the city, as it did not have 
any existing infrastructure to respond to the needs of the 
newcomers. 

To help address the needs of the refugees the city 
immediately dedicated a space for the construction 
of the Elaionas camp. Elaionas, the first temporary 
accommodation center in the country, currently provides 
shelter to nearly 2.400 refugees. The city also appointed 
a Deputy Mayor responsible for the migrant and refugee 
agenda. Moreover, with the support of international 
partners and local NGO, the city was able to provide first 
reception services, but also to start planning for a housing 
program currently underway, subsidizing the rent of vacant 
apartments for the refugees.

The city’s next goal is not only to provide first reception 
services to the population but also to draft and implement 
a holistic policy and action plan regarding the integration 
of migrants and refugees to the urban fabric. This plan 
should have a developmental approach and it should be 
based on the potential contribution and positive impact 
of the newcomers to Athens aiming at delivering solutions 
and achieving multiple benefits for all the residents. It will 
also take into consideration the output from the Athens 
Migration Exchange Network handbook.

the Municipality of Athens will set up a Migration 
and Refugee Coordination Center (MRCC) to 
prepare a refugee integration strategy. The MRCC 
will coordinate numerous city actors and will be 
responsible for managing the Municipality’s daily 
activities which relate to helping refugees. This 
will consist of liaising with major programs such 
as the UN Refugee Agency’s housing program, 
local stakeholders as well as other international 
organizations (e.g. Mercy Corps, International 
Rescue Committee) to provide emergency response 
services in case of a crisis. 

Additionally, an Observatory for Refugees and 
Immigrants will be created, which will collect data 
on refugees to support and inform the activities and 
services offered by the MRCC. The data will be open 
to local and international stakeholders and will help 
inform policies and planning decisions related to 
migrants and refugees.

Migration integration action plan

C.2.3 Community centers

The municipality plans to create with EU structural 
funds the following:

• Two Community Centers, one stationary in the 

city center and one mobile that will be visiting the 
seven different municipal districts

• Two Migration Integration Centers, one stationed 

in the city center and another one that will be 
mobile.

• A Center in the 4th district dedicated to the needs 

of the Roma populations. 

These centers will be reception places providing 
support and information regarding all types of 
welfare services provided by the City of Athens. 
All actions are related to social integration and 
supporting the subsistence level of the most 
marginalized populations. The Migration Integration 
Centres will be able to provide in addition 
supportive actions such as Greek language, history 
and culture lessons, intercultural activities for young 
people and children of local as well as refugee and 
immigrant populations, as well as activities that 
facilitate access to the job market.

Decentralization, Migration and Refugees) 

C.2.4 Activities aiming at immigrant population 
integration

The municipal initiative Schools Open to the 
Neighborhood was established in 2016 aiming to 
host activities, accessible to all Athenians, within 
school premises during after-school hours and 
weekends (separate description available below). 
While this initiative has already turned school 
building into vibrant centers of activity for the 
community and students, teachers, parents, and 
residents who participate in a host of educational, 
cultural, athletic, and entertainment activities, 
several of them already have managed to engage 
migrant populations. One of the most successful 
examples are the cooking lessons that engage 
women’s networks that get together and cook 
recipes from all over the world. The afternoon 
activities of neighborhood people in open schools 
in every district are the perfect environment for 
integration initiatives.

Goal A

Enhance the city’s identity and promote 
new types of belonging
The City of Athens needs a positive identity. One that can 
foster pride among its people while supporting the new 
types of identity and belonging that have emerged during 
the past few years. Athens has been a hotbed of social 
innovation, finding ways to survive across different cultures, 
religions and norms. The City of Athens should find ways to 
institutionally support the bottom up trends and initiatives 
that kept the city standing through the time of crisis.

Description: 

The City of Athens will tap into the experience of other 
cities such as New York and Detroit for designing and 
implementing an identity card for the residents of 
Athens which will renew a sense of belonging and pride 
for Athenians, enabling migrants and refugees in a 
large variety of administrative problems they now face, 
recharging commerce in the city and culture through 
special card benefits. Then new Athens ID will strengthen 
a relationship of transparency while promoting efficiency, 
accountability and a sense of inclusion between the 
municipality and the Athenians. This initiative will bring 
together and encouraging the commercial sector to 
participate, along with big cultural venues, utility services 
as well as municipal and other administrative and social 
services. It’s a win-win-win case scenario.

Creative economy strategic plan

Description: 

Athens’ rich cultural heritage is a major driver of growth. 
The creative industries are leading the capital’s transition 
to a smart, sustainable economy. Thanks to cutting-
edge technology and highly specialized staff - from 
multimedia editors to branding experts – Athens’ cultural 
entrepreneurs are forging new growth areas in Greece’s 
21st century economy.

The creative economy is especially vibrant in Athens, 
however the lack of strategic planning and a complex 
bureaucracy prevents the rise of the industry. The city will 
draft a plan focusing on supporting creative industry and 
on upgrading the role of the city through the creation of a 
friendly entrepreneurial ecosystem.

The improvement of a regulatory framework in 
combination with a holistic developmental approach 
that attracts capital investment will boost the quality 
of goods and services as well as improve the global 
position of Athens as a creative capital. The actions to 
be implemented are: formation of an Advisory Board as 
the overseeing body; commission an economic and fiscal 
impact analysis; draft a strategic action plan and start 
with most implementable interventions.

The mandate of the Advisory Board will be to investigate 
the connections between the informal and formal 
sectors as crucial for informed creative economy policy 
development support the creative industry at the local 
level and provide incentives to creative businesses 
located in the seven city districts. The aim is to boost 
the Athenian creative class by fostering creative 
clusters, encouraging use of empty buildings as creative 
hubs, supporting the creation of business incubators, 
accelerators and networks, and organizing special events 
across the city.

The creative industry can be an infinite opportunity 
for development, however its impact and 
contribution on the city’s economy is still vague. 
Athens will undertake a two-prong assessment of 
the creative activities:

a. Inventory, Assessment and Financial Analysis of 
the Creative Economy sector in Athens. The city will 
create an inventory of all activities related to the 
creative economy and then assess the economic 
impacts of these activities on the local economy.

b. Economic and Fiscal Impact Analysis of municipal 
cultural spending (OPANDA, Technopolis City of 
Athens, ADDMA projects, Athens Culture Net). The 
city will undertake a broad–based assessment of the 
value of public arts and cultural spending in Athens 
– starting from analysing itself.

Further funding decisions should be based on the 
KPIs that emerge from this work, which will provide 
the groundwork for an integrated strategy regarding 
Athens’ Cultural/Creative Economy.

C.2.3 Artists and residencies network

The Athenian art scene has been flourishing 
with new talents from Greece and abroad. The 
continuous economic recession as well as major 
events – such the significant documenta14 synergy 
with Kassel – creates an attractive but challenging 
environment for artists. 

Athens will create a network with artists and 
residencies in order to support the city’s emerging 
art scene. The network will attract advertising, 
funding tools and platforms of collaborative cultural 
entrepreneurship using the city as a demonstration 
space. More specifically Athens through the Artists 
and Residencies Network will:

• promote the residency programs for artists and 
researchers; housing thus becomes a space for 
dialogue and work giving artists more leverage as 
cultural identity makers, 

• offer Athens based artists more professional 

opportunities (e.g. art walks and open studios 
days, public arts commissions etc.),

• establish capacity building structures and tools 
for artists and cultural entrepreneurs, organize 
master classes and foster alternative educational 
opportunities, 

• cultivate Athens’ cultural brand through 

participation and partnerships with local and 
foreign institutions and artists, 

• support existing and create new art festivals.

Following the example of other successful city 
brands and an exciting beginning with its city brand/
tourist campaign in 2016, Athens will gradually 
adopt a common brand for all its endeavors: This Is 
Athens logo and branding. Currently the numerous 
and different municipal programs, organizations 
and initiatives lack a cohesive branding. This adds 
to confusion and lack of awareness considering the 
City of Athens while preventing the development of 
This Is Athens to its full potentials. 

This Is Athens brand should eventually be linked 
to the municipal business and strategic planning. 
The City of Athens will promote communication 
and collaboration between all the municipals 
departments and projects, which will inform and be 
informed by the holistic city brand This Is Athens.

Following the example of the Athens Tourism 
Partnership (ATP) as well as the Athens Convention 
and Visitors Bureau (ACVB) the city will scale up 
and maximize its partnership potential to include 
other major city investors in the funding and co-
creating major municipal initiatives.

The Athens Tourism Partnership (ATP) - a 
joint effort by the City of Athens, the Athens 
International Airport and Aegean Airlines - was 
established aiming at the city’s tourism sector 
growth, by positioning Athens as a modern cultural 
city destination. ATP agreed to pool resources and 
develop a 2016-2017 Marketing and Communications 
program under the official This is Athens brand 
umbrella. Marketing Greece was assigned the role 
of Campaign Manager. This is the beginning for 
building up capital synergies that will create and 
consolidate of a common concepts and effort, 
sustained by the addition of further investment 
and buy engaging more and more segments of the 
Athenian tourism providers. 

The Historic and Commercial Triangle’s 
Development Plan for Athens will be closely linked 
to the ADDMA synergies and partnerships. The 
vision and feasibility plan created for the center 
of Athens, will provide the “pull” for further

the residents of Athens who should be the first 
and foremost ambassadors of Athens and their 
municipality when in contact with visitors. The 
sense of pride and belonging can be channeled 
and maximized through the Athens ID program and 
card.

Therefore a close collaboration between ADDM and 
the ORS is crucial for the outline of a cohesive and

For every 60 people that visit Athens a new job is

City of Athens should negotiate with the tourism 
sector (e.g. large hotels, catering, shops) a quota 
for hiring Athenian residents (for example a 20%) in 
the tourism job openings. The City of Athens should 
consider using its prerogative to open up a local 
employment agency.

Green And Cultural Urban Corridors

Description: 

The city is looking into the opportunity of linking 
important green areas as well as several cultural 
landmarks together, by constructing green, walkable 
urban corridors. Already in the Climate Change 
Adaptation Action Plan, two different but compatible 
actions refer to the creation of Green Corridors, one 
more locally within the municipality of Athens and the 
other on a metropolitan scale. Existing green areas in 
the Municipality of Athens are scattered around different 
districts; their connection will create much better 
microclimatic conditions in the city. The same is true in 
regards to the city’s major historic landmarks and cultural 
centers: networking them, making it possible to walk from 
one to the other, magnifies their potential.. 

The proposed green and cultural corridor connects the 
National Auditorium, with the Olympic Stadium, the 
Zapeion Mansion and the Hill of Arditos. Then it continues 
to the Columns of Olympian Zeus linking them with the 
Acropolis Museum and the Great Pedestrian Walk of 
Dionysiou Aeropagitou . The next stretch would connect 
the Acropolis Museum with the National Museum of 
Modern Art , the Onassis Cultural Center and finally the 
Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center . The city 
center would thus open itself through a beautiful walkable 
and cyclable green boulevard, Syngrou Avenue, to the 
great gardens, library and opera house of the Niarchos 
Center, but also to Faliro: its natural seafront.

More important, but also more long-term, would be a 
similar corridor eventually linking Athens to the port of 
Piraeus. This corridor would transform Piraeus Avenue 
into a boulevard, connecting the Benaki Mouseum and 
Technopolis with the archaeological site of the Keramikos 
cemetery and the Ancient Agora of Athens. It would thus 
link these sites with the pedestrian road that surrounds 
the Acropolis, this time from the west. Pass through a 
redesigned Omonoia Square the green corridor would 
continue to the Archaeological Museum transforming 
Patision Avenue into a boulevard that would go through 
some of the most depressed neighborhoods of Athens. 
This is a very densely built and inhabited part of town, 
with the least green and open spaces, and the highest 
unemployment and poverty rates.

Sustainable municipal real-estate

Description: 

Athens is restoring and repopulating municipal buildings 
in order to create dynamic spaces for the Athenian 
neighborhoods. The city needs to design sustainable 
development plans for the management of these build 
resources that can support crucial and/or innovative 
industries and communities (creative economy, start-up 
community, civil society and social entrepreneurship). 

These efforts will start and use as pilot the recently 
renovated Serafeio Sports, Cultural and Innovation 
Center. The center includes a swimming pool, several 
sports fields, a playground as well as co-creation spaces 
and opportunities for large PV and other renewable 
energy systems.

Serafeio can provide a focal starting point for creating 
a methodology for sustainable development regarding 
different municipal buildings (reporting. KPIs, feasibility 
analysis, action plan etc.)

Description: 

Currently the City of Athens is undertaking a significant 
initiative called Trigono [triangle], piloting the 
development and revitalization of a small part in the 
Athens Commercial and Historical Triangle. The pilot area 
is expected to expand in concentric circles over the whole 
city center (and replicated in each of the 7 city districts 
in the future). Up scaling this project, i.e. designing the 
development and revitalization of the Center of Athens, 
needs a vision and a long term strategic plan that take 
into consideration the areas assets and special character, 
as well as its challenges. An analysis of the heat, energy 
and seismic characteristics of its building stock, a detailed 
and forward thinking mobility study, and an economic 
and fiscal Impact analysis of investment should inform 
both vision and strategy. This is a major project for the 
City of Athens; it will boost its economy, tourism and 
most importantly revitalize the city in a resilience building 
way that will allow it to have a future and thrive.

The Trigono project (2016-2018), which is supported 
by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, aims at upgrading 
the aesthetics, logistics, operation and maintenance 
of a small down town area, promoting walkability, 
entrepreneurship and stakeholder engagement, in order 
to revitalize approximately 110,000 square meters (27 
acres) in a holistic way. This small area is a characteristic 
part of the Commercial and Historic Triangle, i.e. the 
vibrant heart of Athens which in total includes its main 
commercial streets, the Parliament and several Ministries, 
major monuments, hotels and city squares as well as the 
central turn-of-the-century food market. Right below 
the Acropolis, it includes the Old Athens town of Plaka 
along with many contemporary cultural sites. However, 
the ubiquitous cars and traffic, the narrow crowded 
sidewalks and illegal encroaching of public spaces, the 
Urban Heat Island Effect, and the aging building stock 
limit the economic potential of the area creating negative 
impressions of the city to visitors, investors and residents.

Goal B

Maximize existing city assets and

Many of the city's assets have been wasted or underused. 
These include vacant buildings/apartments, empty lots, 
public and green spaces, roof tops and of course its human 
resources. Through the suggested actions we propose a 
shift of culture that reinvents and reinvests on all these 
assets that have up to now been overlooked.

Vacant buildings: crucial urban resource

Description: 

Athens will launch a strategic plan aiming at revitalizing 
the city’s center through empty building restoration and 
occupancy.

Over the years, the densely populated center of Athens 
has been plagued by high vacancy rates, deteriorating 
infrastructure, and absence of public and private 
investments. These conditions stifle the economic 
potential of the area and negatively impact visitors’ and 
investors’ impressions of Athens. There are approximately 
1.800 abandoned buildings within the municipality, more 
than 10% of which are also classified as dangerous for 
either structural or public health risks. Furthermore, 
from declining property values to increasing crime and 
municipal costs, the deleterious impacts of vacant and 
abandoned properties are well documented.

The Mayor of Athens has drafted a legislative amendment 
that would enable the municipality to facilitate the 
management and leasing conditions for abandoned 
buildings. This amendment allows municipalities to pursuit 
interested parties that could undertake the renovation of 
vacant and abandoned properties in the center of Athens 
in order to returning them to productive use and revitalize 
blighted neighborhoods.

The city should first champion passing the legislation 
amendment in order to be able to go forth with the 
implementation of a developmental and equitable 
strategy regarding abandoned buildings as well as the 
best possible maximization of their value. The program 
should draw inspiration from best similar practices 
from European and the US cities, from the robust 
study assessing the characteristics of these 1.800 
buildings issued by the Urban Planning Department of 
the University of Thessaly (sponsored by the Onassis 
Foundation), as well as from the existing ADDMA’s 
initiatives regarding the coupling of empty stores with 
young and creative entrepreneurs.

Vacant buildings: crucial urban resource

B.1.1 Creative uses of unused spaces

Due to the complex legal framework for private 
ownership and the continuing economic crisis, 
Athens currently exhibits many open empty lots, 
half built constructions and abandoned buildings 
throughout its 7 districts. The concept of temporary 
usage presents a set of solutions, inspired by other 
cities around the world while integrating a whole 
set of local urban dynamics that are creating today 
the right environment for co-creation, collective 
commitment and community engagement. 

Athens will create a framework of actions of 
creative uses of unused spaces cultivating the 
methodologies and the best practices shared in 
international networks and partnerships with cities 
within and outside Greece. 

a. Assess and implement the forthcoming URBACT 
action plan "Refill" focusing on creating an action 
plan with proposed solutions on the temporary use 
of empty spaces.

b. Investigate the multiple studies that populated 
the Franziska Orzo Project (2016) regarding 
incomplete construction of buildings and facilities 
left gaping in Metaxourgio and the Kerameikos area.

c. Examine the implementation possibilities of 
the Vienna project or Project Urbanaughts and 
Gratzelhotel (Neighborhood Hotel) for Athens 
together with investment possibilities.

Description: 

After six whole years of economic crisis the levels of 
unemployment in Greece are the highest in the Eurozone: 
23,3% in the general population and 44,2% among young 
people (January 2017: Eurostat) 

The City of Athens, except from the Municipal 
Employment Agency allowed by the local authority 
legislative framework (Kalikratis), doesn’t have other 
authorities regarding employment and job creation. 
However, through its two developments agency’s the 
Athens Destination and Development Management 
Agency and the Technopolis City of Athens, the City 
of Athens in the years of economic crises, through 
collaborations with all the city’s Professionals Associations 
and major partners from the IT sector, managed to 
establish several Business Start-up Incubators and 
Accelerators. The most famous of which INNOVATHENS 
located in Technopolis City of Athens.

Even though it does not fall under its precise jurisdiction, 
authority and scope, the City of Athens, through 
partnerships, innovative thinking and legislative 
amendments is ready to develop and launch a series of 
equal opportunity initiatives that will help employment 
and the development of SMEs.

B.2.1 Platform for extra work 

B.2.2 Work integration social enterprises

This is a policy proposal that was developed in the 
context of the Transatlantic Policy Lab (TAPL), an 
initiative instituted in Boston and Athens by 100RC 
Platform Partner, the Bertelsmann Foundation. The 
proposal aims at making the local labor market 
more efficient by enabling people to connect and 
identify informal employment opportunities.  

The Platform for Extra Work centers on how the 
municipality can make the local labor market more 
efficient by setting up a digital platform in which 
Athenians can seek informal employment. This 
initiative combats the black market, increasing 
individual income and contributing to GDP growth. 
Through this initiative the city will assess and 
qualify available demand, engage funders, and 
keep the market for extra work (which is largely a 
black market) under local control and supplied with 
bookings.

Funding sources: the Bertelsmann Foundation and

Time frame: Short-term to Medium - term

After 6 years of economic crisis with high levels 
of unemployment among locals and refugees 
unable to leave the country the City of Athens 
needs to find ways to help integrate people into the 
workforce. This is important for the city’s systems 
and structures, as Athens is actually emptying out, 
losing its population as many businesses have close 
and many houses are empty. In addition city staff is 
shrinking and the city doesn’t have the ability to hire 
more employees. 

The municipal social services department launched 
in 2016 a pilot program linking social welfare 
beneficiaries to social entrepreneurship. The pilot 
program included 20 beneficiaries. Based on that 
experience the city should scale it up and institute a 
whole series of Work Integration Social Enterprises 
based on the example of similar programs in Europe.

The following steps of the pilot program should 
be scaled up and enhanced by the experience 
of other cities/countries that have proposed and 
implemented policies that repositioned thousands 
of disadvantaged persons from conventional 
welfare structures in which they were simple objects 
of assistance, to full re-integration in society. That is 
transforming them into producers and generators of 
value for themselves and for others. 

a. Provide training for Social Services’ Employees 
implementing the methodology developed by the 
ADDMA’s program for social entrepreneurship 

b. Link beneficiaries from vulnerable populations 
with to social entrepreneurs

c. Monitor the beneficiaries’ progress 

d. Develop a robust methodology for the integration 
of socially vulnerable groups to social enterprises 

e. Develop a micro-loan scheme

Social housing program

Description: 

The continuous economic recession has left a significant 
percentage of the population facing the risk of 
homelessness as they cannot afford rent, taxes and loan 
payments. Therefore, the provision of an equitable, fair 
and sustainable module for social housing constitutes 
a crucial need for Athens. Even though it doesn’t fall 
within the limits of its jurisdiction the municipal social 
services have already established several such building to 
accommodate a small part of the marginalized population 
needs.

It is a resilient knowledge that achievements can only be 
gained through balanced and thoughtful development 
plans measuring the geographical urban and human 
resources. 

The city in collaboration with the central government 
should create a program to provide social housing 
in empty buildings of Athens in a diverse group of 
vulnerable populations and beneficiaries. The system 
should be based in a strict and fair model of evaluation of 
the beneficiaries based on meritocracy in order to justify 
the selection of the people and the implementation of the 
project.

Workshops for Promoting Resilience 
Organise a Polykatoikiathon

The city needs to capitalize on its unique and particular typology of apartment 
buildings, the Polykatoikias, and encourage better and new types of uses.

Since the start of the financial crisis, many urban residents in Greece (and in other 
countries around the world) are beginning to embrace and accept the apartment 
building as part of an effort to better understand their cities and, by extension, 
themselves.

We will organize a hackathon in which designer, architects, urban planners, 
academics and other professionals will prioritize existing opportunities and 
generate new ideas about retrofitting and rethinking potential uses of the multi 
story residential buildings of Athens. The possible outcomes will connect this 
fascinating element of the city with its resilient actions and provide ideas on 
addressing key issues like the energy poverty, the climate change and the social 
inequality.

Old train stations refurbishment

% !

#

@

Description: 

The Athens Railway Station, which is known by the name 
Larissa Station is the main railway station of Athens 
supporting long-distance travel to major destinations in 
the Greek mainland. The station is served by the Athens 
Metro and by the suburban train line that link it, though 
not directly, to the Athens International Airport. The 
station is a significant city landmark and resource as 
it serves large numbers of people on a daily basis and 
constitutes a crucial part of Greece’s historical and socio-
economic life.

The Athens Railway Station (Larissa Station) was 
inaugurated in 1904. It was built right next to an older 
train station, the Peloponnese Station, a listed national 
heritage site, constructed in 1884. The building was 
inspired by the Chemins de fer Orientaux in Istanbul. 
The Peloponnese Station was closed in 2005 and 
all its activities have been transferred to the nearby 
Larissa Station. The past years civil society informal 
organizations and other more formal stakeholders have 
organized successful events within the premises of the 
close building, highlighting its old world charm and its 
potential cultural, social and economic value. This old 
Athens gem is ready to be reborn though a brilliant, 
forward-looking regeneration project. The project should 
focus on developing Peloponnese Railway Station as a 
multimodal cultural and entrepreneurial (food) hub and 
a new landmark for the city maximizing its historical and 
architectural significance.

The Athens Railway Station (Larissa Station) struggling 
to fulfill the everyday demands of modern Athens 
needs to be renovated as well. The building can inspire 
and support a variety of architectural interventions for 
multiple uses and the grounds provide incentives not only 
for significant social, economic and environmental urban 
development. The renovation and refurbishing of both 
stations will provide new opportunities for a multifaceted 
development of the adjacent devastated neighborhoods. 
The station could become a vibrant part of the everyday 
life of the city.

In the 100RC network, the city of Bristol, United Kingdom 
is also investigating a new set of city metrics as the 
basis for designing and evaluating future city policies 
and programrs across different organizations and policy 
areas. Those metrics will measure city progress against 
parameters such as wellbeing, and inclusion alongside 
traditional economic indicators helping Bristol to move 
towards fairer and more sustainable future growth across 
the city and region. As part of this action, the Resilient 
Athens Team will collaborate with Bristol and its Chief 
Resilience Officer to share approaches and information.

#2 – Open data | Bristol

In the 100RC network, several cities, including the city of 
Bristol, United Kingdom are also pursuing the benefits 
of sharing the city’s data to address city challenges, 
promote innovation and make the city more open and 
accountable. By improving accessibility and citizen 
engagement with city open data platform provides

#3 – Bristol city 2066 Net-Zero Homes | Bristol

Most global governments are successfully delivering 
against their carbon emissions reduction targets. It is 
widely thought that climate change has been successfully 
contained to within 1.5 degrees. A Well-Being Index is 
used in political decision making in Bristol and many 
other devolved areas of the UK. The Circular city initiative, 
adopted by several UK cities, has led to a step-change 
increase in resource efficiency. Bath has been recognized 
for its excellence in resource hyper-efficiency and has 
become a leading example globally. Urban hubs such 
as Southmead, Hengrove and Thornbury have become 
increasingly restructured around localized services that 
support and promote zero waste.

Producers are required by international law to design 
goods for disassembly and reuse globally. There has 
been an accelerated effort to construct net-zero homes 
in Bristol’s rural areas and on brown-field sites, and a 
marked increase in regional food production in recent 
years. North Somerset has pioneered quality green 
housing in the UK. Smart metering is used across all 
domestic and commercial asset types, helping manage 
demand for energy and water. Over 500,000 new 
jobs have been generated as a result of the Vision for 
Sustainable Growth.

well as energy savings the rest of the time. It can operate 
as part of or independent from the utility grid. The 100RC 
city of New York is currently implementing the micro grids 
and micro grid networks solutions to local businesses. 
The Resilient Athens Team will reach to the city in order 
to identify the best possible approaches for Athens.

#13 Communication Campaigns | Barcelona

As part of its long-term strategy to improve relations 
between new immigrants and native residents, the 
Barcelona city Council launched an innovative public 
campaign to dispel rumors, misconceptions, and 
prejudices that local people have about minorities and 
newcomers. Modeled on successful campaigns that made 
drinking and driving, and smoking, urgent public issues, 
the initiative includes a series of videos that satirize 
various stereotypes, such as losing cultural identity 
because of immigrants. 

#9 – Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan

#14 Waste Management | Amman

In November 2016, 100 Resilient Cities - Pioneered by The 
Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) and C40 Cities Climate 
Leadership Group (C40) announced their partnership to 
leverage resources and facilitate cooperation between 
the two groups, along with member cities to ensure for 
robust climate change and resilience plans.  The Athens 
Climate Adaptation Plan is a result of the collaboration 
between two of the world’s leading urban networks and 
policy organizations. 39 cities are currently participating 
in both networks.

The sharp rise in the population in and around Amman 
(mostly due to recent influxes of Syrian refugees) has 
led to a 25% increase in the levels of waste generation. 
To meet this challenge, the city is developing a 
comprehensive program to reform the solid waste 
sector that will lead to the generation of renewable 
energy, reduction of CO2 emissions, and creation of 
new jobs. Besides developing and implementing a waste 
management framework, the city will establish waste to 
energy facilities and other pilot projects.

#10 - Goal B – Proactive Pillar | Thessaloníki

#15 Sustainable Mobility Roadmap | Bangkok

Thessaloníki the other Greek city in the 100RC network 
is currently developing actions to upscale the role of 
boroughs to the development and progress of their 
districts. The city is proposing a set of pilot projects 
that will introduce new methods of civic engagement, 
decentralize power and improve trust and engagement 
between local authorities and citizens. As we are growing 
in a common legal and regulatory environment, Resilient 
Athens team will collaborate with the city and its Chief 
Resilience Officer to share information about successful 
projects and lessons learn.

 city case studies & inspiration

Working with our partners

TransAtlantic Policy Lab | Proposals for an equitable and resilient Athens

education, health and employment. At the city level, 
the lab recommends enhancing economic opportunity 
by supporting individual access to legitimate periodical 
opportunities and leveraging Athens’ comparative 
advantage in the medical tourism sector. At the 
neighborhood level, the lab recommends strategies to 
engage youth and develop anchor institution-community 
relations. 

The place making group focused on developing context-
specific place making tactics to enhance social equity 
in Athens. Public space can play a crucial role in this 
process, serving as a crossroads for people, place and 
policies. Public space is where citizens exchange their 
views and the municipality’s collective culture, politics, 
economy and ecology come together. The City of 
Athens should undertake a sustained effort to activate 
participation, citizens’ views, knowledge and practices 
through public space. The recommendations put forth by 
the place making group are divided into three tiers. These 
tiers align with opportunities for short-term action, long-
term action and pilot projects aimed at spurring further 
projects and activities in both the short and long term. 

The TAPL recommendations were presented to the Mayor 
and to the Deputy Mayors as well the Athens Resilience 
Steering Committee and a series of other stakeholders. 
Several of them are integrated into the Athens Resilient 
Strategy and they have influenced the strategy and the 
overall resilience process in a profound and holistic way.

The Bertelsmann Foundation, with generous support from 
the Open Society Foundations, partnered with the 100 
Resilient Cities (pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation) 
and the German Marshall Fund of the United States 
(GMF) to launch the Transatlantic Policy Lab (TAPL). 
One American city (Boston) and one European city 
(Athens) have been selected to serve as pilot partners for 
assessment, analysis and policy implementation. TAPL 
convened a diverse group of American and European 
policymakers, practitioners and thought leaders to 
pursue innovative approaches to address the issue of 
social inequity. The group charged with identifying and 
designing customized policy solutions for implementation 
in each pilot city. 

The Athens Lab was designed to build on the key findings 
of the Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA), which 
used community engagement to rank and order the 
municipality’s resilience priorities. The recommendations 
contained finally fed into the Athens’ Resilience Strategy.

A week-long explorations by a team of trans-Atlantic 
experts from local government, nongovernmental 
organizations and the private sector, took place at 
Athens on June 2016. It composed of eight American 
and eight European policy experts drawn from a range of 
backgrounds. The 16 participants divided into two teams, 
each accompanied by one local expert from the city. Each 
team of experts focused on one of two neighborhoods 
within the city those of Victoria Square and Avdi Square. 
In order to identify the specific drivers of social inequity 
at work in Athens, lab experts from the perspective social 
equity and inclusive growth focused on two topics, which 
were job creation, employment and entrepreneurship and 
place making aiming at reviving public space for residents 
and businesses in each neighborhood.

The Athens Lab was an intensive, on-the-ground exercise 
designed to produce targeted and implementable 
recommendations based on community input. The Athens 
Lab’s findings constitute a recommendation memo for 
the City of Athens that outlines and includes specific 
proposals for improving social equity and economic 
opportunity in the two focus municipality districts, and a 
review of best practices (policies and programs). The lab 
produced the following recommendations as a result of 
its collaboration and engagement with City of Athens and 
local stakeholders in the three thematic areas: trust and 
accountability, economy and place making.

The trust and accountability group has proposed 
recommendations to support a more functional, livable 
and inclusive municipality that enhances well-being 
and opportunity so that all Athenians have the chance 
to thrive. This group proposes a municipal initiative to 
change the culture of how government serves citizens, 
be more transparent and accountable and galvanize 
residents to work toward making Athens a more 
functional, livable, inclusive and resilient city.

The economy group has developed its recommendations 
to boost resilience through initiatives to support trust,

Athens Network Exchange: Global Migration Resilient Cities at the Forefront

This Opportunity Report offers relevant approaches and 
examples of how to use data for better decision-making, 
as well as to better inform and engage residents.

Mass migration has grown into one of the major urban 
challenges of the 21st Century. As cities contend with the 
effects of climate change and aging infrastructure, they 
must also learn to adapt to waves of newcomers. Today, 
more than 60 million people have had to leave their 
homes because of conflict, in the largest wave of human 
displacement since World War II. Yet even this number is 
dwarfed by the world’s total population of international 
migrants, which peaked at 244 million in 2015. Regardless 
of their reasons for arrival, the overwhelming majority 
of migrants now remain in cities, and are helping shape 
their future. Like other urban pressures, migration also 
presents a powerful opportunity for building resilience. 
In September of 2016, eight 100RC member cities, with a 
broad range of experience absorbing migrants, convened 
in Athens to collaborate on migration as a key component 
of urban planning. Chief Resilience Officers (CROs) 
from Athens, Thessaloníki, Amman, Paris, Montreal, Los 
Angeles, Ramallah, and Medellin, shared what they have 
encountered, their successes and failures, and worked 
together to put forward practical solutions. The cities 
also had the additional expertise of partners such as 
the International Rescue Committee, MasterCard, Esri, 
the International Organization of Migration, Welcoming 
America, the Brookings Institution, Mercy Corps, and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 

Against the backdrop of the refugee crisis, Exchange 
participants seized the opportunity to make migration 
central to the urban agenda. Athens’ experience 
presented a poignant illustration of the need to prioritize 
solutions that provide multiple benefits through single 
interventions in both times of crisis and times of calm 
Global Migration: Resilient Cities at the Forefront 
reflects the exchange’s clear-eyed appraisal of the urban 
challenges of migration and the participants’ collective 
work to address and find opportunity in them. Organized 

into four approaches, the document highlights best 
practices and pressing challenges, and concludes by 
emphasizing the need for cities to develop better local, 
national, and international partnerships to successfully 
integrate newcomers and build resilience that makes 
cities better for all residents.

As mass migration challenges our cities in unprecedented 
ways, we must continue to build a foundation for 
incorporation into our visions for a resilient future. 
Through this hand-book, and the collaboration it 
reflects, we can build on the important work of moving 
beyond the sudden shocks of migration towards the 
possibilities it brings. We stand at a critical crossroads, 
where the actions we take now will impact the future of 
all our residents and generations to come. We have the 
responsibility to work together to recognize and adapt to 
an unpredictable future, and to remain committed to the 
equitable adaptation and transformation of our cities. 

“The numbers and statistics found in the Global Migration: 
Resilient Cities at the Forefront handbook attest for the 
crucial role that migration and refugee flows are and 
will probably be one of the main challenges that our 
city is and will face. As a result of the Athens Network 
Exchange and the discussion between the participating 
cities and experts what became evident was the need to 
move away from the perspective that sees this challenge 
as a humanitarian crisis that different countries and 
international organizations have to deal with. 

A resilient approach sees the influx of populations as an 
opportunity for urban center development. For those 
who will choose to stay in our country, it becomes a 
challenge for us to integrate them into our society in the 
best possible manner, helping the revival of our economy 
in the city’s neighborhoods. The newcomers can become 
a source of enrichment in the modern multi-ethnic and 
multicultural urban environment of our city.” 
Eleni Myrivili, Athens CRO.

Waste Management and Cleaning Services

A) Municipal waste collection and public 
realm cleansing strategy

The objective of the strategy is to perform a gap analysis 
between the existing municipal waste collection and 
public realm cleansing arrangements and the objectives 
that Athens Municipality aims to achieve in order to 
improve the resilience and the overall standards of their 
waste management system. 100 Resilient Cities, ARUP 
and the City of Athens collaborated for this strategy. 

and cleaning services. The result of this workshop is 
concluded in 3 reports.

Report #1: Building a culture of responsibility and 
awareness towards waste management

This Opportunity Report offers relevant approaches 
and examples of policies and methods for effective 
waste separation, educational programs, awareness and 
communication campaigns, as well as programs and 
incentives to increase compost and recycle levels.

The strategy concluded in a long list of recommendations 
categorized as:

Report #2: Enhancement of waste management 
infrastructure and equipment

Stakeholder roles and implementation

Resilient Athens: an inclusive and participatory process

Stakeholder roles and implementation

Core value of the resilience model is participation. 
Athens, like the other 99 Resilient Cities, introduced the 
concepts and methods of the 100 Resilient Cities program 
by convening an Agenda Setting Workshop (with 130 
Athenians). February 2016, the city started its resilience-
building journey by drafting a robust Stakeholder 
Engagement Plan.

A year and a half later, Athens is bestowed with this 
document created in collaboration with city officers 
and elected officials, central government authorities, 
academics, nonprofits, , entrepreneurs,  and a large 
variety of citizens and community groups. More than 
140 organizations and 900 citizens participated in 40 
workshops, conferences or public events. Athens initiated 
and co-hosted international meetings with fellow cities; 
international and local experts worked together trying to 
get a better grasp of the challenges the city is facing as 
they searched for resilient solutions.

Beyond the main three international collaborations 
around the themes of Migration, Climate Change and 
Social Equity, we also co-organized along with other 
municipalities, central government representatives, NGOs 
and the Heinrich Bell Foundation two large multiple day 
conferences on Municipal Energy Savings and Energy 
Poverty with about 200 participants. We also co-
organized with Symbiosis - Center for Political Studies of 
the Council of Europe, a two-day workshop on Open Data 
and local government with 100 participants including 
administrators from four other municipalities, relevant 
ministries and public utility companies. 

We also organized four cross-sectoral and cross-
jurisdictional working groups of more than 100 people and 
several smaller workshops aiming breaking municipal and 
cross level administrative silos. The topics covered heat 
waves and the urban heat island effects, greening the city, 
Athens assets and risks, women entrepreneurs, migration 
and integration, best practices for social cohesion and 
coexistence, city branding and public-private sector 
collaborations, urban planning and sustainable mobility.  
In February 2017, 30 city officers and 30 citizens 
participated in a Problem-Framing Workshop, organized 
by our platform partner citymart, aiming at identifying 
the challenges and providing realistic solutions to waste 
management and city cleaning.

Almost all of our municipal departments and agencies 
participated in meetings and discussions as well as 
workshops and conferences and provided key input 
regarding the everyday management of the city and the 
current legislative and regulatory framework of Greek 
local authorities.

The Resilience Steering Committee (RSC) played a crucial 
role as the overseeing body of the Athens Resilient 
Team. The RSC is an interdisciplinary cohort of high-level 
stakeholders from different governmental, academic 
and nonprofit institutions and areas of expertise. The 
committee comprises of 18 members and is led by 
the Mayor of Athens. The key objective is to provide 
interdisciplinary input and guidance on the content 
of the Athens resilience strategy on its development 
and integration into municipal operations, funding and 
implementation. The RSC met four times during the first 
year of the Athens Resilient Team’ operation and provided 
valuable input and inspiration in the formation of the 
Athens Resilient Strategy.

What comes next?

The Athens Resilience Strategy is the result of the 
invaluable investment of many busy people’s time, insight 
and inspiration generously provided in the context of 
many discussions, brainstorming sessions, structured 
workshops and research.  From university students to 
deputy mayors, from migrant women to the members 
of the seven city district councils and from international 
experts to Athens-based architects and planners, 
the resilience dialogue reach out to many relevant 
stakeholders, aiming at investigating as many as possible 
opportunities for a holistic, long-term and realistic 
resilience building plan for the city made out of robust, 
concrete and implementable actions. 

The shared and collaborative process will continue during 
the next phase of the strategy. Following the release of 
the strategy, we will start developing an implementation 
plan with the different municipal departments and 
city partners, to identify the priority actions for 
implementation in the short term By championing the 
strategy, city stakeholders, will forge the links between 
the Strategy and the city. By continuing full-heatedly 

the engagement with different stakeholders, with new 
working groups and the Resilience Steering Committee, 
we will proliferate and enhance the relations created 
during the first year of Resilient Athens.

We invite you to be part of the effort. We invite you to 
identify actions you would like to be involved in let us 
know of practices that you think are already contributing 
to our resilience goals. We are constantly looking for new 
partners, new ways of working and new ways to finance 
and find new resources for our city’s resilience building 
actions.

Monitoring and evaluation plan

Office of Resilience and Sustainability

Monitoring

Since December 2016, the new organizational chart and 
management structure of the City of Athens is in effect 
according to the governmental official gazette No 3812/
B’/28-11-2016. This management structure establishes, for 
the first time in the city, the Resilience and Sustainability 
Office (ORS) under the Mayor’s office. 

During the drafting of this document, ORS is funded by 
100RC while there are great efforts to participate in EU 
funded projects through collaboration with organization 
across Europe in the framework of large consortium.

Implementation

ORS team is currently working for over 1 year in the 
development of the Resilience Strategy. Through this 
exciting and resourceful work, the ORS has established 
its role in the city and the top management is in close 
collaboration with the Resilient Athens team. In this 
framework, the ORS has already undertaken the 
implementation of specific actions that are of high 
importance for the Mayor. In this context, the Resilient 
Athens team will undertake the implementation of 
specific action that will be appointed during phase III and 
in collaboration with the city stakeholders such as deputy 
mayors, municipal development companies, etc, will co-
implement other actions or provide assistance of any kind 
to the project management teams of these actions. 

More specifically, the ORS will:

• establish an Internal Monitoring Team to oversee the 

implementation of the Resilience Strategy 

• prepare Phase III: Implementation with 100RC. Available 

tools and services for implementation of Strategic 
Actions

• organize meetings with the relevant Deputy Mayors in 

order to select and prioritize implementable actions for 
the upcoming 2 years 

• launch a workshop with relevant municipal 

administrators to present the Resilience Strategy and 
set up specific targets and budgets

The main objective of the office is to ensure that the 
approved Resilience Strategy and its actions will be 
properly developed, implemented, monitored and 
reported. Additionally, ORS will closely collaborate 
with the vice mayors, municipal districts councils and 
other stakeholders inside and outside the municipal 
authority, in order to, promote and mature the resilience 
actions. The biggest challenge for the ORS, following its 
establishment, is to ensure its continuity throughout the 
different political leaderships and establish an office with 
high level experts and knowledge that will ensure the high 
level implementation of the Resilience Strategy. 

ORS will monitor the implementation and the impact of 
the actions using the monitor indicators for each action 
(see Appendix) specifically developed for this reason, 
while monitor the impact on the SDG goals as they have 
been allocated in each action. The monitoring indicators 
that will monitor the SDGs are being drafted by the 
General Secretariat of the Hellenic Republic.  Moreover, 
monitoring indicators and KPIs from the Sustainable 
Urban Development Plan, Integrated Territorial 
Investments Actions the Integrated Urban Development 
Plan will be assigned to each action as per the indicators 
specifically developed in the framework of these Plans.  

Evaluation

Each action of the Resilience Strategy will be monitored 
through the establishment of performance indicators. 
The evaluation of the actions will be the result of 
the measurement and assessment of the monitoring 
indicators. Evaluating actions, changing them if necessary, 
and being open about what has and has not worked, will 
be a significant benefit of Resilient Athens, both locally 
and across the 100RC network. Each action will have each 
progress and evaluation report which will be updated 
frequently. The evaluation will contain corrective action 
plans and suggestions on how to overcome specific 
barriers.

Glossary

Actions: Actions can be policies, projects, and initiatives. 
They can be very simple or complex tasks, at the local or 
metropolitan scale. Actions require collaboration between 
different stakeholders and level of governance in their 
implementation, ownership, data monitoring and impact 
evaluation. Actions can be:

• Short-term: 1-2 years 
• Medium term: 3-5 years
• Long term: 5-10 years 

Aspirational: It requires additional scoping before it can 
be implemented

Resilient Athens team: a group of staff from City of 
Athens and external agencies, who provide expert 
advice on particular subject matter, to help develop and 
implement Resilient Athens. 

Chief Resilience Officer: a position funded by 100RC to 
lead a city’s resilience-building efforts; the author of a 
city’s resilience strategy and the guiding hand for ongoing 
implementation of the strategy in the city. 

Discovery Areas: The key areas to investigate during 
Phase II of the resilience strategy. 

Goals: specific mid-term and log-term objectives that the 
city agrees are the most important to fulfilling the vision 
and the pillars. 

Pillars: long- term statements which address the vision 
statement and illustrate overall impact

Preliminary Resilience Assessment: a document that 
establishes an initial, qualitative understanding of 
the city’s strengths and weaknesses against the City 
Resilience Framework of drivers and sub-drivers. 

Resilience Steering Committee: a group of relevant 
decision-makers responsible for guiding and overseeing 
the delivery of Resilient Athens. 

Resilience Strategy: a plan for building resilience in a city. 
The strategy articulates the city’s resilience priorities and 
specific initiatives for immediate implementation, as well 
as its longer-term plans. 

Shock (or acute shock): a sudden event that threatens 
a city, such as an earthquake, flood, disease outbreak or 
terrorist attack. 

Stakeholder: an individual, group of people, or 
organization, either within or outside city government, 
with the capacity or influence to help build resilience.

Stress (or chronic stress): a longer-term problem 
that weakens the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or 
cyclical basis. Examples include high unemployment, an 
overtaxed or inefficient public transport system, endemic 
violence, and chronic food and water shortages.

10%Resilience Pledge: The 10% Resilience Pledge urges 
mayors of 100RC cities to make the most ambitious 
commitment to city resilience in history, promising 10% 
of their cities’ annual budgets toward resilience-building 
goals and projects, without raising additional funds or 
taxes.

Acknowledgements

Acknowledgments – it takes (more than) a city!

Resilient Athens was made possible by the generous 
support of the Rockefeller Foundation and the 100 
Resilient Cities (Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation). 
We owe them gratitude for supporting this important 
effort of resilience building in our city.
Without the inspiration, insights and unwavering 
support of our strategy partner, ARUP, the design of 
Athens’ Resilience Strategy would not be possible.. We 
also acknowledge the extensive contribution of the 
Bertelsmann Foundation, C40 Cities Climate Leadership 
Group,the Bloomberg Associates and the National 
Observatory of Athens.  

We also thank the following Chief Resilience Officers 
for our close collaboration in the context of the Athens 
Migration Exchange Network: 

Lina Liakou (Thessaloníki), 
Sebastien Maire (Paris) 
Fawzi Masad (Amman), 
Marissa Aho (Los Angeles), 
Santiago Uribe  Rocha (Medellin), 
Louise Bradette (Montreal),
Mohammed Saheen (Ramallah).

Resilient Athens is the result of the effort and 
collaboration of numerous city officers, representatives 
from organizations and institutions inside and outside 
the Municipality as well as members of informal and 
grassroots groups. Many busy people have given their 
time to take part in workshops, meetings, conferences 
and day-to-day discussions. We hope they will continue 
to be involved as we implement, evaluate and expand the 
actions that will build the resilience of our city over the 
decades to come.
