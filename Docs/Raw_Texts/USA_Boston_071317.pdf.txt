Friends,

There are few things that make me more proud than being mayor of this 
great city. With that pride comes a deep sense of history, responsibility, and 
awareness that we must work collectively to ensure that our future is a resil-
ient one. Our task is to confront our deepest challenges, find opportunity in 
them, and strengthen Boston for all Bostonians. 

With Resilient Boston, we have an opportunity to do just that. Through the 
dedicated work of Chief Resilience Officer Dr. Atyia Martin and the rest of 
our team, we have already begun to make great strides in making Boston 
stronger. We are addressing our most serious shocks, such as extreme 
weather events, and our chronic stresses, such as economic inequality and 
aging infrastructure. 

However, what sets our strategy apart is our commitment to view urban re-
silience through the lens of racial equity. Our engagement with race can no 
longer be isolated from our decisions and actions regarding other issues. In 
addressing the divisions of race in our city, we will be leveraging our diversity 
as a resource to strengthen our city as a whole. To that end, we are creating 
an open, honest, and continual dialogue. This is important now more than 
ever.

Rather than merely a symbolic gesture, or words printed on a page, only 
this kind of dialogue, with deep and searching honesty, can help the city 
develop meaningful resilience amid its many current and future challeng-
es. Dr. Martin worked tirelessly to ensure that the voices and concerns of all 
Bostonians are reflected in our vision for the future. 

In the coming decades, Boston’s population could well exceed 800,000 
people. The planning and policy decisions that shape the city’s future will 
be made over the next several years. As Resilient Boston makes clear, race is 
central to the success of nearly every issue the city encounters in this import-
ant and ongoing work. 

A truly resilient city is one that works to achieve equity: ensuring that vital 
services reach all residents, including the most vulnerable; providing access 
to opportunity for all; and actively fostering cohesive communities. Today, 
Boston is taking a major step toward achieving what is possible when we 
truly recognize and confront our deepest challenges. While we celebrate this 
seminal achievement, we also acknowledge that now begins the hard work 
of making resilience a reality. I invite you to join us in this work.

Sincerely,

Martin J. Walsh 
Mayor 
City of Boston

Resilient Boston

 

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities family, I want to congratulate 
Mayor Walsh and the city of Boston on the release of Resilient Boston. This is 
a major milestone for our partnership, and for a city doing some of the most 
pioneering work in the United States, our network, and beyond. 

 The cradle of American democracy, with a rich history of progressive social 
programs and civic activism, Boston is continuing its long tradition of ad-
dressing inequity. Central to Resilient Boston, the City’s framework for a re-
silient future, is racial equity. Rather than an isolated aspiration amid many 
others, racial equity guides other resilience initiatives, making Boston a true 
leader that other cities can emulate.

Building on The Blueprint—the first building block of the City’s Strategy 
released last fall—Boston continues the bold work of reflecting on systemic 
racial inequity as an urgent and defining problem. With this as its founda-
tion, the Strategy connects the issue of race with other challenges the City 
faces due to urbanization, globalization, and climate change. As the City 
prepares for major shocks, such as extreme weather events, and address-
es ongoing stresses like economic inequality and aging and inequitable 
transportation infrastructure, the lens of racial equity helps integrate these 
complex and interrelated issues in order to make the city stronger for all 
residents. 

Thanks to the tireless work of Boston’s Chief Resilience Officer, Dr. Atyia 
Martin, the Strategy reflects the concerns of Bostonians. Through open and 
honest dialogues across the city, Dr. Martin and her team engaged with 
over 11,000 Bostonians, and this engagement with all of Boston’s commu-
nities guided the development of the Strategy and the City’s priorities. The 
resulting Strategy is a true collaboration between the city’s leadership and 
Bostonians.

This kind of engagement has led to some of the most innovative initiatives 
we have seen in our global network. For example, Resilient Boston describes 
efforts to address mental health and trauma in communities across Boston, 
engage with all Bostonians—particularly the most vulnerable—in new ways, 
pilot and scale new economic mobility programs, and advance key transit 
improvements to promote equity.

From the beginning, Mayor Walsh’s bold commitment to honest introspec-
tion about racial equity and its role in shaping Boston’s future set the tone 
for the development of Resilient Boston. While the hard work is only now 
beginning, we are confident that the commitment of the Mayor, Dr. Martin, 
and the thousands of Bostonians already invested in the process will ensure 
its success.

We look forward to our continuing partnership, and to seeing Boston lead by 
example as a city that acknowledges and learns from its most difficult prob-
lems in order to build a future in which the city not only survives but thrives. 

Sincerely,

Michael Berkowitz 
President

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

As  one  of  America’s  oldest  cities,  Boston  has  long  been  a  beacon  for  those  who 
stand strong in the face of adversity: from the first Freedom Fighters paving the way 
for American independence to our collective response in the face of terrorism. Our 
thriving city reflects the best of a diversifying country—home to a highly educated, 
multicultural, and skilled population, a healthy economy, a high-functioning gov-
ernment, and world-class universities and nonprofit institutions. And we are driven 
by the belief that all Bostonians, even our most vulnerable, can stand strong in the 
face of any challenge to live, work, raise families, and thrive in Boston throughout 
their lifetime.  

Under  Mayor  Martin  Walsh’s  leadership,  our  city 
has already taken great strides in addressing some 
of  our  most  intractable  challenges—from  issu-
ing Boston’s first comprehensive citywide plan in 
more than 50 years, Imagine Boston 2030, to de-
veloping an action plan for carbon neutrality. Now, 
with  Boston’s  first  Resilience  Strategy,  the  City  is 
advancing a comprehensive action roadmap that 
builds upon these and other efforts to ensure that 
integrated  solutions  maximize  benefits  for  all 
Bostonians.

In  Boston,  achieving  citywide  resilience  means 
addressing  racial  equity  along  with  the  physical, 
environmental,  and  economic  threats  facing  our 
city.  We  are  developing  robust  systems  and  poli-
cies that ensure that we all rise together and leave 
no one behind. Only when every resident is able to 

reach their full potential, regardless of their back-
ground, will we be a truly resilient city.

In  2014,  the  City  of  Boston  was  selected  for  in-
clusion  in  100  Resilient  Cities—Pioneered  by  The 
Rockefeller  Foundation,  a  global  network  that 
helps  member  cities  around  the  world  become 
more resilient to the physical, social, and econom-
ic challenges that are a growing part of the twen-
ty-first century. Through the program, Boston hired 
its first Chief Resilience Officer in September 2015. 
Since  then,  the  City  of  Boston,  Dr.  Atyia  Martin, 
and her team have worked with more than 11,000 
Bostonians to develop Resilient Boston. This docu-
ment articulates our collective aspirations for our 
city and our future, and the resources needed to 
get there.

Our  Strategy  is  organized  into  four  long-term 
Visions  for  Boston,  each  of  which  has  a  corre-
sponding set of Goals and Initiatives. On their own, 
these Visions support Bostonians’ aspirations for a 
city that can withstand and surmount the impacts 
of every unexpected shock and stress, and where 
all Bostonians have the capacity to do the same in 
their own personal lives and communities. Taken 
together, these actions will make Boston a model 
for cities confronting the complex threats to their 
resilience. 

 

 

 Reflective City, Stronger People: We envision a 
city where our government leads by example to 
proactively  institutionalize  racial  equity  within 
its  programs  and  policies,  while  encouraging 
other  organizations  to  do  the  same;  where 
Bostonians engage with each other to heal and 
strengthen  our  connections;  and  where  com-
munities are trained and equipped to support 
each other and partner with government, busi-
nesses,  and  community  organizations  in  the 
face of shocks and stresses. 

 Collaborative, Proactive Governance:  We  envi-
sion a city that prioritizes community-led pro-
cesses and community partnerships, where City 
services are delivered equitably to people and 
communities, and City government reflects the 
diverse culture and people it serves.  

 

 

 Equitable Economic Opportunity: We envision 
a city in which intergenerational wealth-build-
ing  opportunities  are  accessible  to  every 
Bostonian,  no  family  lives  in  perpetual  fear  of 
displacement, and all children benefit from ed-
ucational  opportunities  that  prepare  them  for 
postsecondary education and careers.  

 Connected, Adaptive City: We envision a Boston 
where all residents are connected to each other 
and to their city through resilient infrastructure 
and  systems  that  meet  the  needs  of  all  fami-
lies. These connected communities will be pre-
pared for and can adapt to the urgent threat of 
climate change. 

is  ambitious: 

it  reflects  a 
Resilient  Boston 
cross-collaborative,  nontraditional,  and 
inclu-
sive  approach  to  developing  solutions.  It  breaks 
down  typical  City  silos,  uses  data  to  inform  deci-
sion-making, and ensures that programs and pol-
icies are developed using a racial equity lens. This 
Strategy builds upon existing plans and brings to-
gether Bostonians’ collective goals.

This is an exciting and critical time for the City of 
Boston, and transforming our systems and insti-
tutions to meet the needs of all Bostonians can 
only be achieved with your help. Please join us in 
strengthening Boston’s resilience by participating 
in this conversation. Your continued collaboration 
will help us create a more equitable and resilient 
Boston for all.

THE FOUNDATION  
FOR BUILDING RESILIENCE

ENVISIONING OUR FULL POTENTIAL IN BOSTON
The  City  of  Boston  is  growing—more  and  more 
people  are  choosing  to  live  and  work  here  each 
year. We are projected to number 724,000 by 2030 
and surpass our 1950 peak population of 801,000 
by  2050.1  Since  the  recession,  the  economy  has 
bounced back, unemployment reached its lowest 
recorded  level,2;3  and  we  are  in  the  midst  of  the 
third  major  building  boom  in  the  city’s  modern 
history.4 However, not every resident has been able 
to share in this recent prosperity. Many Bostonians 
are  facing  daily  and  compounded  pressures  of 
financial  insecurity  and  lack  of  affordable  hous-
ing.  In  addition,  our  aging  transportation  system 
does  not  serve  all  residents  equally,  and  health 
outcomes  continue  to  vary  by  neighborhood.5 
The achievement gap in education is a persistent 
and  vexing  challenge,  and  climate  change  and 
extreme  weather  events  pose  increasing  threats 
to  our  communities  and  infrastructure,  with  the 

greatest  impacts  often  felt  by  our  already  most 
vulnerable residents.6 These challenges are further 
compounded by systemic racial inequity and the 
resulting  harm  it  inflicts  upon  our  communities 
and families.

As  Boston  continues  to  grow,  we  must  ensure 
that  the  benefits  of  that  growth  reach  all  of  our 
residents. We have both the opportunity and the 
obligation to ensure that our growth benefits all, 
regardless of their race, class, or neighborhood. In 
today’s national political climate, this work is more 
important than ever.

We believe that the only way to foster citywide re-
silience is to address racial equity along with the 
physical,  environmental,  and  economic  threats 
facing  our  city.  In  this  spirit,  we  present Resilient 
Boston.  This  Strategy  strives  to  ensure  that  all 

8

Bostonians have the resources they need to over-
come  obstacles  and  thrive  throughout  their  life-
times.  Only  when  every  resident  is  able  to  reach 
their full potential, regardless of their background, 
will we be a truly resilient city.

This  Strategy  also  relies  on  cross-collaborative, 
nontraditional  partnerships  both  within  our  gov-
ernment  and  with  our  community,  regional,  na-
tional, and international partners in order to tackle 
complex  resilience  issues.  These  partnerships  are 
critical  to  developing  innovative  ways  to  leverage 
investment  across  physical,  social,  and  economic 
realms.

Resilient Boston  is  the  result  of  input  from  more 
than 11,000 Bostonians. It reflects a collaborative 
and  inclusive  approach  to  developing  solutions 
to address racial equity and resilience challenges. 
It seeks to break down typical City silos, use data 
to  inform  decision-making,  and  ensure  that  pro-
grams  and  policies  are  developed  using  a  racial 
equity lens.

Resilient Boston  aims  to  be  comprehensive  and 
encompasses  both  existing  and  proposed  initia-
tives. It builds upon existing plans, such as Imagine 
Boston 2030, the city’s first comprehensive plan in 
more than 50 years, in addition to other issue-spe-
cific plans focused on climate, transportation, ed-
ucation,  and  other  policy  areas.  We  are  integrat-
ing long-term resilience goals and policies into all 
of our plans, indicating the City’s commitment to 
carrying out this important work.

RACIAL EQUITY VS. EQUALITY
Racial  equity  means  “closing  the  gaps”  so  that  race  does  not 
predict  one’s  success,  while  also  improving  outcomes  for  all. 
Equity is distinct from equality in that it aspires to achieve fair 
outcomes and considers history and implicit bias, rather than 
simply providing “equal opportunity” for everyone. Racial equity 
is  not  just  the  absence  of  overt  racial  discrimination;  it  is  also 
the presence of deliberate policies and practices that provide 
everyone with the support they need to improve the quality of 
their lives.7

WHAT IS RESILIENCE?
Resilience  is  the  capacity  of 
individuals, communities, in- 
stitutions,  businesses,  and 
systems  within  a  city  to  sur-
vive,  adapt,  and  thrive—no 
matter what kinds of chron-
ic  stresses  and  acute  shocks 
they experience.8

BOSTON HISTORY AND 
CONTEXT TIMELINE

From  its  founding  in  1630  to  the  present  day,  Boston’s  history  has  been  shaped 
in almost equal parts by decisions made at the national level and local responses 
to those national policies. Our specific history of racism, discrimination, and social 
cohesion is no exception. Despite the city’s deep involvement with the abolitionist 
movement of the nineteenth century,9 generations of Bostonians have experienced 
implicit and explicit bias in all aspects of life—from interpersonal relationships to 
housing policy to educational opportunity—and continue to do so today.

Historically, national economic policies that were 
meant  to  address  the  needs  of  working  class 
Americans have largely excluded people of color.10 
For example, in the wake of the Great Depression: 
the  National  Recovery  Administration  offered 
more jobs and paid higher wages to White work-

ers;11 the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) wouldn’t 
insure  mortgages  in  neighborhoods  that  were 
home  to  communities  of  color,12  nor  in  “White” 
neighborhoods  that  did  not  incorporate  racially 
restrictive  covenants;  and  Social  Security  didn’t 
cover agricultural or domestic workers, who were 

1832:

Beacon Hill emerges as a 
prominent African American 
community in Boston, home to 
the first public school for Black 
children in the country (the Abiel 
Smith School),25 the African 
Meeting House, and the Hayden 
House, a prominent stop on the 
Underground Railroad.26

1848:

1882:

A series of local and federal 
rulings reinforce the institu-
tion of slavery, including the 
decision in Roberts v. City 
of Boston (1848) that main-
tained school segregation, 
the Fugitive Slave Act (1850), 
and the Dred Scott decision 
(1857).28

The Chinese Exclusion 
Act bars Chinese im-
migrants from enter-
ing the United States 
and requires Chinese 
residents already 
residing in the U.S. to 
register with the federal 
government.30

1843:

Personal Liberty Act (MA) 
(known as the Latimer Law): 
Activism in support of George 
Latimer, an escaped, formerly 
enslaved person, results in 
a new law prohibiting state 
officials from aiding in the 
return or detention of formerly 
enslaved individuals.27

1863:

The Earle Report 
recommends that 
Massachusetts Native 
Americans be considered 
citizens with full voting 
rights.29

largely people of color.13 Many of these programs 
provided  a  foundation  upon  which  White  fami-
lies could build wealth, but did no such thing for 
families  of  color.  In  Boston,  FHA  policies  allowed 
bankers  to  devise  a  plan  to  provide  low-interest 
loans to homebuyers of color14 but restrict them to 
Mattapan and parts of Dorchester, neighborhoods 
that remain majority of color today.15

Boston’s  physical  and  social  history  was  greatly 
impacted  by  several  national  policies  that  were 
enacted during the 1940s and 1950s. The Federal 
Housing  Act  of  1949  established  the  program  of 
Urban Renewal, providing cities with funding to ac-
quire parcels of land that were considered “blight-
ed.”16 Cities used the legal tool of eminent domain 
to  take  privately  owned  land  from  residents,  so 
long as it was put to “public use” and the govern-
ment  provided  “just  compensation.”17  However, 
in many instances, including in Boston, residents 
were  not  duly  compensated  for  their  property,18 
and  those  familiar  with  the  process  have  argued 

that the term “blight” was infused with racial prej-
udice.19 Using “blight” to describe neighborhoods 
with  higher  concentrations  of  people  of  color  al-
lowed governments to “relocate minority popula-
tions and entrench racial segregation.”20 In Boston, 
the  impact  of  these  policies  led  to  large-scale 
displacement  as  the  West  End,  a  neighborhood 
of  mostly  working-class  western  European  im-
migrants,  gave  way  to  Government  Center,21  and 
Chinatown ceded 1,200 units of housing to make 
way  for  a  highway  and  other  development.22  In 
2015, Boston Planning and Development Agency 
(BPDA) Director Brian Golden acknowledged the 
trauma caused by Urban Renewal and apologized 
to former residents of the West End on behalf of 
the City.23 

The  1960s  saw  federal  action  on  civil  rights,  with 
legislation  prohibiting  discrimination  in  employ-
ment,  voting,  and  housing.24  Influenced  by  the 
tireless  efforts  of  civil  rights  advocates,  the  Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 contained provisions that laid 

1933:

The New Deal 
ushers in reforms 
and policies 
designed to 
help struggling 
Americans during 
the Depression. 
However, many of 
these programs 
exclude people 
of color, exacerbating racial inequity and 
segregation.33 

1963: 

National civil 
rights activ-
ism is echoed 
locally with the 
Boston School 
Stay Out, the 
founding of 
Freedom Schools, and the Ruth Batson-
led effort to charge Boston Public 
Schools with discrimination, along with 
countless public demonstrations.36

1920s: 

1952:

The Great Migration begins.31 
Over the course of several 
decades, 6 million African 
Americans move from the rural 
South to the urban Northeast, 
Midwest, and Western United 
States.32

The Federal Urban Renewal 
Program reaches Boston, facil-
itating the demolition of build-
ings and residential displace-
ment across the city, including 
in Chinatown, the West End, 
and the South End.35

the groundwork for establishing affirmative action 
programs  and  codifying  a  proactive  and  holistic 
approach to civil rights for the first time. President 
Lyndon Johnson himself acknowledged that there 
was work to be done beyond the signing of these 
laws when he articulated in a speech to Howard 
University the principle of affirmative action: “You 
do not take a person who, for years, has been hob-
bled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to 
the  starting  line  of  a  race  and  then  say,  ‘you  are 
free to compete with all the others,’ and still just 
believe that you have been completely fair.”37 

In  the  1960s,  Johnson  also  initiated  the  War  on 
Crime,  a  set  of  policies  that  made  the  control  of 
crime  a  federal  priority,  giving  the  federal  gov-
ernment a role in local police operations.38 In the 
1970s, President Nixon declared a War on Drugs, 
which  over  the  course  of  a  few  decades  has  led 
to  mandatory  minimum  sentencing  and  higher 
incarceration  rates,  with  people  of  color  being 
incarcerated  at  a  disproportionately  high  rate.39 

According  to  the  NAACP,  African  Americans  are 
incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of White 
Americans,  and  one  in  six  Black  men  had  been 
incarcerated  as  of  2001.40  Though  Massachusetts 
has a lower incarceration rate than other states,41 
recent high-profile instances of police brutality in 
Florida,  Missouri,  New  York,  Louisiana,  Minnesota, 
Maryland, and elsewhere have inflamed racial ten-
sions and sparked nationwide protests. In Boston, 
protesters  have  recently  taken  to  the  streets  on 
numerous  occasions,  including  a  January  2015 
demonstration that shut down Interstate Highway 
93 during the morning rush hour.42

Perhaps  no  single  event  encapsulates  Boston’s 
fraught  history  with  racism  more  than  the  city’s 
experience  with  the  desegregation  of  its  public 
schools in the 1970s. In 1974, Boston was a large-
ly  segregated  city  in  which  children  of  color  did 
not have access to quality schools.43 With Boston 
unable  or  unwilling  to  address  its  disparity  and 
segregation problems on its own, parents of Black

Boston Public Schools students brought the issue 
to the judicial system. That year, Federal Judge W. 
Arthur Garrity found that Boston’s school commit-
tee  “knowingly  carried  out  a  systematic  program 
of segregation affecting all the city’s students” and 
ordered schools to be desegregated by means of 
busing.44  While  Boston  had  deep  racial  tensions 
before  busing,  the  implementation  of  this  order 
magnified these tensions. The mandate was met 
with  intense  backlash  by  some  White  residents 
and  set  off  a  violent  and  traumatic  conflict  that 
gained  national  notoriety.45  While  low-income 
White students were generally subject to limited 
educational  opportunities  that  mirrored  those  of 
young  Black  Bostonians,46  many  White  families 
with the means to leave the Boston Public Schools 
(BPS) system either fled the city or enrolled their 
children in private and parochial schools.47 Within 
a  year,  nearly  a  third  of  the  White  students  had 
been taken out of the school system, and overall 
enrollment had dropped by almost 20 percent.48 

Overall,  the  second  half  of  the  twentieth  centu-
ry  saw  Boston’s  population  fall  steeply  from  its 
1950  peak  of  801,000  to  just  under  563,000  in 
1980.  Boston  has  seen  continuous  growth  since 
then, and the city’s accelerated growth since 2010 
means  that  Boston’s  population  is  expected  to 
again match its peak in the year 2050.49 

Since 1970, the population of Boston has become 
more racially and ethnically diverse, and in 2010, 
people of color made up 53 percent of the popu-
lation.50 Despite the increasing diversity, however, 
neighborhoods still remain largely segregated. In 
fact,  according  to  2010  Census  data,  Boston  re-
mains  one  of  the  most  residentially  segregated 
large metropolitan regions in the country.51 In light 
of  Boston’s  history  of  racism  and  discrimination, 
it  will  take  a  concerted  and  significant  amount 
of effort to bridge divides that exist in our city in 
order to ensure that we grow in a way that fosters 
opportunity for all.

young people of color 58 and 
contribute to growing mass 
incarceration.

100 RESILIENT CITIES

100 Resilient Cities—Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) helps cities 
around the world become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic chal-
lenges that are a growing part of the twenty-first century. 100RC provides this as-
sistance through: funding for a Chief Resilience Officer in each member city who 
will lead the resilience efforts; resources for drafting a Resilience Strategy; access to 
private sector, public sector, academic, and NGO resilience tools; and membership 
in a global network of peer cities to share best practices and challenges.

Boston  joined  the  100RC  network  as  part  of  the 
second wave of cities selected in 2014, and through 
its  participation,  is  committed  to  demonstrating 
global  leadership  in  resilience  and  taking  advan-
tage of membership resources and opportunities.

100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of 
a view of resilience that includes not just shocks—
such as floods, nor’easters, and other acute events—

but also stresses that weaken the fabric of a city 
on a day-to-day or cyclical basis, such as economic 
hardship  or  social  inequality.  By  addressing  both 
shocks  and  stresses  in  a  holistic  manner,  a  city 
becomes more able to respond to adverse events 
and is better able to deliver basic functions in both 
good times and bad.

THE RESILIENCE DIVIDEND
By investing in resilience-building actions and ini-
tiatives, cities stand to reduce the impact of acute 
shocks and chronic stresses—including those that 
cannot easily be predicted today. As cities contin-
ue to invest in resilience and implement integrated 
resilience-building actions, they will improve out-
comes  for  individuals,  the  physical  environment, 
and the economy for future residents to enjoy.

Building  resilience  starts  by  identifying  our 
most  important  problems  first  and  figuring 
out the best ways to tackle them together. For 
example, solutions that make healthcare more 
accessible  can  also  keep  our  communities 
safer  from  crime  and  better  prepared  to 
handle emergencies. By considering how one 
policy can benefit the most people, resilience 
helps  everyone  in  the  city,  not  just  the 
wealthy  and  powerful,  and  ensures  our  city 
grows stronger, not just bigger.

Adapting 100RC for Boston: The story of why we applied

In recognizing that Boston still has not fully healed 
from the fight over school desegregation, we knew 
we needed to take deliberate steps to address the 
issues that this era revealed. People who don’t live 
here might think this is a conflict with a natural ex-
piration date, but we believe that even people who 
weren’t alive or here in the 1970s bear the burden 
of what happened then. This lingering trauma is an 
immediate impediment to our resilience. Our frac-
tured  foundation  means  that  we  lack  the  shared 
ability  to  implement  the  boldest  ideas—those 
ideas  that  take  the  greatest  popular  will  and  are 
necessary to address the biggest challenges Bos-
ton faces.

Today,  Boston  has  incredible  potential  to  be  the 
place  that  solves  the  country’s  most  intractable 
problems. We have a highly educated, diverse, and 
skilled population, a healthy economy, a high-func-
tioning  government,  and  world-class  universities 
and  nonprofit  institutions.  However,  our  history 
with systemic racism stifles the potential of these 
assets. We must acknowledge our history, heal our 
collective trauma, and advance racial equity, social 
justice, and social cohesion if we are to move for-
ward as a truly resilient city.

DEVELOPING 
RESILIENT BOSTON

From September 2015 to December 2016, Boston’s 
Chief Resilience Officer and her team worked with 
more  than  11,000  stakeholders,  including  resi-
dents,  community  leaders,  and  City  government 
employees across many departments. The process 
involved  careful  analysis  of  quantitative  trends 
and data, internal City coordination across differ-
ent  planning  processes,  community  meetings, 
and working group convenings in order to devel-
op clear, actionable initiatives that best articulate 
many Bostonians’ aspirations for their city.

Resilient Boston

Resilient  Boston  was  developed  in  close  part-
nership  with  the  Boston  Resilience  Collaborative 
(BRC), created as an advisory body to the process. 
The BRC includes more than 100 local experts in 
fields  such  as  racial  equity,  climate  change,  the 
built  environment,  transportation,  and  public 
health,  and  will  aid  in  implementation  of  the 
Strategy.

In order to introduce racial equity as a central com-
ponent of Resilient Boston, Mayor Walsh convened 
more than 1,000 Bostonians for the first in a series 
of public conversations about race, and issued The 
Blueprint: A Preview of the Principles & Framework 
for Boston’s Resilience Strategy in November 2016.

Residents  and  stakeholders  who  engaged  in  the 
process consistently expressed concerns that rein-
forced Boston’s identified shocks and stresses. We 
found that many Bostonians are eager for the op-
portunity to change the culture and conversation 
around  race  in  Boston.  Many  also  find  that  they 
don’t have the resources they need to achieve fi-
nancial security and are even at risk of being dis-

placed from their current neighborhoods. A large 
portion  of  residents  feel  that  City  programs  and 
planning  are  complicated  and  inaccessible,  and 
it  is  unclear  how  these  programs  support  local 
communities. Boston’s most vulnerable residents 
and  communities  often  suffer  unrecognized  and 
profound impacts from trauma. Lastly, many res-
idents  are  worried  that  Boston  is  not  adequately 
prepared to meet future infrastructure challenges.

The  Visions,  Goals,  and  Initiatives  that  form  the 
basis of Resilient Boston are informed by our his-
torical  perspective,  the  analysis  of  current  condi-
tions, and the feedback of these stakeholders. The 
Strategy’s implementation must be shared by all 
stakeholders, including City government, commu-
nity partners, institutions, and individual residents.

This  Strategy  is  grounded  in  equity  and  can  be 
used by stakeholders to trigger action, investment, 
and support to facilitate change, both from within 
City  government  and  more  broadly  throughout 
Boston. This has been and will continue to be an 
—inclusive  process  that  needs  participation  and 
ownership from all partners.

The historic growth in population that Boston is currently experiencing has 
brought about a wave of investment and opportunity; cranes are in the sky, 
our core sectors of education and healthcare are growing, and new business-
es, small and large, are opening across the city. The benefits of this growth, 
however, have not been shared by all.

While  our  city  enjoys  a  strong  economy 
overall, one in five Bostonians—and nearly 
one  in  three  children  under  18—live  in 
poverty.63 This disparity falls largely along 
lines  of  race.  Median  household  (family 
and  non-family)  earnings  for  non-Latinx/
Hispanic White Bostonians ($79,802) con-
tinue to outpace those of Black ($38,454), 
Latinx/Hispanic 
($30,883),  and  Asian 
($38,802)  residents.64  An  analysis  of  total  wealth,  rather  than  wages  alone, 
reveals  even  starker  disparities.  A  2015  study  by  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank 
of Boston revealed that White households in greater Boston have a median 
net  wealth  (total  assets  minus  debt)  of  $247,500,  while  African  Americans 
have  a  median  net  wealth  of  just  $8.65  Increasing  homeownership  among 
Bostonians of color can help close this gap, as homes are typically the largest 
asset that contributes to a household’s overall wealth.66 However, people of 
color in Boston face significant barriers to entering the city’s homeownership 
market. In 2015, Black Boston residents were denied a home-purchase loan 
at a rate 3.2 times as high as their White counterparts, and Latinx/Hispanic

residents were denied twice as often as White res-
idents.70  These  racial  differences  underscore  the 
vulnerability that people of color in Boston face in 
times of financial shocks and stresses.

From  2010  to  2014,  the  number  of  jobs  in 
Boston  grew  by  more  than  60,000  to  719,000.71 
Unemployment  has  decreased  since  the  Great 
Recession at a rate faster than both the state and 
the nation. A large part of this overall growth can 
be explained by Boston’s emergence as one of the 
foremost knowledge-driven cities in the country,72 
with large anchor institutions such as universities 
and hospitals making up a large percentage of our 
workforce and the booming tech and life scienc-
es sectors accounting for many new jobs.73 While 

Boston  has  recovered  well  from  the  2008  reces-
sion,  the  benefits  of  this  recovery  have  not  been 
shared  by  all.  For  instance,  while  these  growing 
sectors are great assets to our economy, many of 
the  new  jobs  that  they  offer  are  out  of  reach  for 
many Bostonians due to their high education and 
training  requirements.74  The  unemployment  rate 
among African Americans is 1.72 times higher than 
the  city  average,  and  the  Latinx/Hispanic  unem-
ployment rate is 1.38 times higher.75 Of particular 
concern is the fact that Boston’s economic growth 
has been disproportionately enjoyed by non-Bos-
ton  residents  who  work  in  Boston.  The  earnings 
of  Boston  residents  lag  significantly  behind  non-
residents,  even  when  accounting  for  educational 
attainment.76

The effects of climate change also present significant shocks and stresses for 
Boston. As a coastal city, Boston is at particular risk of flood or other damage 
associated  with  sea  level  rise.  In  2013,  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-
operation  and  Development  (OECD)  ranked  Boston  the  eighth-highest 
metropolitan  area  worldwide  in  expected  annual  economic  losses  due  to 
coastal flooding.78 The effects of rising sea levels could devastate our region, 
including  impacts  on  critical  infrastructure  such  as  Logan  International 
Airport,  North  and  South  Stations,  the  Boston  Convention  and  Exhibition 
Center, and the Seaport World Trade Center. In addition, critical City assets 
such  as  Boston’s  primary  data  center,  central  fleet  maintenance,  six  of 
Boston’s neighborhood emergency shelters, and Boston Police Department’s 
telephone  and  computer  communications  are  all  in  areas  susceptible 
to flooding.79

The increase in extreme weather events also presents a challenge for Boston. 
Since 1991, Boston has experienced 21 weather-related events that triggered 
federal or state disaster declarations.80 Had Superstorm Sandy hit Boston in 
2012  during  high  tide,  six  percent  of  Boston’s  landmass  would  have  been 
flooded,  including  portions  of 
every  coastal  neighborhood.81 
Severe  snowstorms  in  recent 
years  have  highlighted  the 
inability  of  regional  transpor-
tation  systems  to  adequately 
serve all residents. During the 
winter  of  2014-15,  a  record 
amount of snow fell in Boston,

(MBTA), the region’s transit network and the fifth- 
largest mass transit system in the country.83 During 
that record-breaking winter, the MBTA complete-
ly  shut  down  on  three  occasions,  and  the  entire 
system  faced  “lingering,  widespread,  systemwide 
interruptions”  for  several  months  after  the  snow 
had fallen.84 While economic impacts of the storms 
were widespread—estimated at nearly $2 billion in 
lost profits and wages throughout the region over 
a  one-month  period—hourly  wage  workers  were 
particularly hard-hit.85 Many of Boston’s most vul-
nerable workers had to endure days without pay 
when either their place of employment was closed 
due to snow or they were physically unable to get 
to work because the transit system had shut down. 
Boston  Public  Schools  also  closed  for  nine  days, 
further  compounding  the  problem  for  low-wage 
workers who also had to worry about childcare.86

In  addition  to  sea  level  rise  and  extreme  weath-
er  events,  climate  change  will  lead  to  increased 
average  temperatures  in  Boston,  as  well  as  local-
ized  urban  heat  island  effects.87  Rising  tempera-
tures and increased instances of extreme heat can 
cause  negative  health  impacts,  including  direct 
loss of life, increases in respiratory and cardiovas-
cular  disease,  and  challenges  to  mental  health.88

VULNERABLE POPULATIONS89
When we talk about “vulnerable” populations throughout this document, we want to make sure to not 
project a general victimhood on these residents. Bostonians are strong and capable, and these popu-
lations are no exception. However, it is also important to acknowledge that these residents are subject 
to inequities not faced by more privileged Bostonians, including historical and systemic discrimination, 
exclusion, marginalization, exploitation, and underrepresentation. Nothing about someone’s race, na-
tional  origin,  age,  etc.,  makes  them  inherently  vulnerable;  we  see  acknowledging  vulnerability  as  an 
assessment of the system’s deficiencies, rather than a judgment of Boston residents.

TERRORISM

Just as we are preparing for natural disasters, Boston must also prepare for 
terrorism  threats  in  an  increasingly  volatile  geopolitical  landscape.91  As  the 
response  to  the  2013  Boston  Marathon  bombing  demonstrated,  effective 
partnerships between municipal, state, and federal actors are crucial in ex-
treme  situations.  Because  of  these  strong  partnerships,  all  people  with  se-
rious  injuries  were  evacuated  within  22  minutes  of  the  explosions.92  In  the 
following days, the Boston Police Department worked closely with surround-
ing  municipalities,  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  Office,  and  the  FBI  to  investigate  the 
circumstances of the bombing. For months after the attack, the City worked 
to provide services for victims and their families, such as a family assistance 
center, housing accessibility modifications, and support groups to help ad-
dress collective trauma.93

Since the 2013 Marathon, Boston has 
increased its capacity to respond to 
acts of terrorism. In the year follow-
ing  the  bombing,  Boston  received 
an  $18  million  grant  from  FEMA 
through  the  Urban  Area  Security 
Initiative  program  and  used  those 
funds to invest in: specialized equip-
ment for police, such as bomb-sniff-
ing dogs and command vehicles; new fire detection equipment; and greater 
investments in communications interoperability so that first responders can 
communicate with each other.94

The coordinated reaction to the Marathon bombing, often viewed as a suc-
cessful example of immediate disaster response,95 was not without criticism. 
At the same time that many Boston residents united with supporters across 
the country and around the world under the slogan “One Boston,” others—
predominantly  residents  of  color  in  neighborhoods  that  experience  higher 
rates  of  chronic  violence—felt  disconnected  from  the  city’s  perceived  unity. 
Community groups contrasted the attention paid to the bombing with the 
lack of attention paid to more frequent instances of community violence. One 
community group, Blackstonian.org, launched a website keeping a running 
count of shootings in Boston following the bombings, highlighting the need 
for more coordinated interventions in the face of individual acts of violence 
and trauma.97

In  order  to  build  resilience  and  racial  equity  in  Boston,  we  must  come  to-
gether to heal our collective trauma and protect ourselves from the impacts 
of future instances of violence and trauma. Until we can heal together, the 
unresolved trauma experienced by our communities will continue to erode 
social cohesion, perpetuate ongoing problems, and undermine our efforts to 
prevent and prepare for future traumatic events.98

Boston’s 
healthcare 
sector  has  long  been  a 
source of pride. We are 
home  to  some  of  the 
world’s 
leading  hos-
pitals  and  medical  re-
search institutions, and 
we opened the nation’s 
first  community  health  center  in  1965,  a  model 
that  has  since  been  expanded  across  the  state 
and  now  provides  medical  care  to  one  in  seven 
Massachusetts residents.99 The 2006 Massachusetts 
healthcare reform, which served as a model for the 
Affordable Care Act, has driven the rate of insured 
Bostonians up to 94 percent as of 2013.100

Despite  the  overall  strength  of  healthcare  in 
Boston,  residents  experience  stark  disparities  in 
health outcomes. Average life expectancies range 
from a high of 87.2 years for Asian residents to a low 
of 77 years for Black residents.101 Black and Latinx/

Hispanic residents experience higher rates of hos-
pitalization  due  to  asthma,  heart  disease,  diabe-
tes, and nonfatal gunshot/stabbing incidents than 
White residents.102 These disparities are even more 
pronounced  at  the  neighborhood  level,  where 
premature mortality rates in Dorchester are nearly 
twice as high as in West Roxbury (249 and 136 per 
100,000 residents under 65, respectively).103

Substance abuse, particularly opioid addiction, is 
a growing problem in Boston. Between 2012 and 
2015, the number of opioid overdose deaths more 
than doubled, from 64 to 141.104 Overall, hospital-
izations  for  substance  abuse  have  also  increased 
significantly,  from  48.9  hospitalizations  per  1,000 
residents in 2008 to 54.8 hospitalizations per 1,000 
residents  in  2012.105  While  opioid-related  over-
doses  are  significantly  higher  for  White  residents 
than  for  Black  and  Latinx/Hispanic  residents,  co-
caine  overdoses  are  significantly  higher  for  Black 
residents.106

Boston has long been a center of education. The nation’s first public school 
was  founded  in  Boston  in  1635,  and  Harvard  College,  the  first  college  in 
America, was founded a year later just across the river.108 We are also home 
to the first large free municipal library in the United States.109 Students come 
to  Boston  from  all  over  the  world  to  train  at  our  numerous  institutions  of 
higher learning.

Although  we  are  seen  as  a  hub  of  learning,  Boston  residents  experience 
significant  and  persistent  achievement  gaps  along  racial  lines.  In  2015, 
White  fourth-graders  scored  27  points  (13  percent)  higher  on  the  National 
Assessment of Educational Progress reading scale than their Black and Latinx/
Hispanic peers, a gap that has only grown in the past 12 years.110 The Boston 
Public Schools high school graduation rate reached an all-time high of 72.4 
percent in 2016, but White and Asian students still graduate at a significantly 
higher rate (82.5 percent and 88.2 percent, respectively) than their Black and 
Latinx/Hispanic peers (69.3 percent and 67.1 percent, respectively).111 Black 
and Latinx/Hispanic students are also disciplined at a higher rate than their 
White and Asian peers. In the 2015–16 school year, Black and Latinx/Hispanic 
students received out-of-school suspensions at rates of 7.5 percent and 4.3 
percent, respectively, while only 1.3 percent of White students and 0.8 per-
cent of Asian students received out-of-school suspensions.112

We know that early childhood education can be the key to closing these gaps. 
While Boston has enough Pre-K seats citywide to meet overall demand, only 
75 percent of Boston’s four-year-olds have access to a high-quality seat, and 
those seats are not evenly distributed across neighborhoods.113

Boston, home to the nation’s first subway tunnel to use electric traction exclu-
sively,116 is served by the MBTA, the country’s fifth-largest mass transit system. 
While many residents rely on the MBTA to commute on a daily basis, with the 
network serving 1.3 million passengers on an average weekday,117 the system 
is aging and not consistently reliable. A 2014 report from the National Transit 
Database stated that the MBTA had the greatest number of mechanical fail-
ures  of  any  major  transit  system  in  the  country.118  The  complete  shutdown 
of the system on numerous occasions during the 2014–15 winter sheds fur-
ther  light  on  the  system’s  overall  vulnerabilities  (see  “Climate  Change  and 
Environmental Stresses” section on pg. 20).

In addition to Boston’s systemwide transportation challenges, residents also 
experience disparate access to fast and reliable transportation options. While 
41 percent of residents live within a ten-minute walk of a rail station or key 
bus  route,  Hubway  station,  and  carshare,  commute  times  vary  widely  by 
neighborhood. Communities  of  color,  in  particular,  face  significantly  higher 
commute times and less reliable transit options. For example, nearly one in 
four residents of Mattapan, a neighborhood whose population is more than 
90 percent people of color, spend more than an hour commuting to work 
each way, and there are limited reliable transit links between the neighbor-
hood  and  employment  centers  like  the  Financial  District  or  the  Longwood 
Medical Area.119

SYSTEMIC 
RACISM

A common theme among the resilience challenges discussed in this chapter 
is that they all disproportionately impact Boston’s communities of color. This 
becomes an even greater issue when we look at how Boston has grown and 
what our current demographics are. As Boston has grown in recent decades, 
we have become increasingly more racially diverse with Boston’s population 
becoming predominantly people of color in 2000, despite only five percent of 
residents being people of color in 1950.120

Viewing our challenges in light of our current demographics, it becomes clear 
that our greatest challenge to resilience is the chronic statistical inequity ob-
served  between  communities  of  color  and  non-Latinx/Hispanic  White  resi-
dents. This inequity leads to significant disparities in economic and quality of 
life outcomes, and disproportionate impacts after disasters. Furthermore, im-
migrants, people with disabilities, children, and older adults are concentrated 
in  neighborhoods  with  higher  percentages  of  people  of  color,121  creating  a 
multidimensional challenge.122

Evidence of systemic racism is visible throughout Boston. Significant oppor-
tunity  and  achievement  gaps  persist  along  racial  and  socioeconomic  lines, 
and Boston is one of the most residentially segregated metropolitan regions 
in the country,123 resulting in pockets of the city where cycles of poverty and 
lack of opportunity seem intractable. If Boston fails to address racial inequity, 
then a growing population of people of color means a growing number of 
residents will face unnecessary barriers to success. This scenario will inhibit 
economic growth and prosperity for all.124

 

SYSTEMIC RACISM
Systemic racism is the result of overlapping policies, programs, practices, institutions, and people who 
exhibit racial bias. These entities can hold various forms of power, and they can wield it to disadvantage 
people of color, either intentionally or unintentionally. While not insignificant on their own, these entities, 
when combined, result in a distinct cumulative oppression that comprehensively restricts the opportu-
nities of people of color and ultimately leads to the disparate outcomes we see today.125

Oftentimes,  systemic  racism  persists  even  without  obvious  signs  of  interpersonal  racism.  In  her  2009 
book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,  Michelle  Alexander  writes 
that visible instances of interpersonal racism “make it easy to forget that many wonderful, good-hearted 
White people… nevertheless went to the polls and voted for racial segregation… Our understanding of rac-
ism is therefore shaped by the most extreme expressions of individual bigotry, not by the way in which it 
functions naturally, almost invisibly (and sometimes with genuinely benign intent), when it is embedded 
in the structure of a social system.”126

Resilient Boston

RESILIENT BOSTON: INTRODUCTIONOUR IDENTIFIED SHOCKS AND STRESSES BOSTON’S RESILIENCE CHALLENGES

How can approaching  
resilience with a racial equity 
lens benefit all Bostonians if it 
focuses on people of color?

The Initiatives that are part of Resilient Boston are designed to improve the lives 
of all Bostonians. We recognize that people of color often face additional barriers 
resulting from systemic racism, but that improvements to different systems within 
the city will benefit all residents.127 We aim to improve the lives of all residents, while 
making a deliberate effort to reduce disparities between White residents and resi-
dents of color.128

Healing racial divisions will provide multiple bene-
fits to all Boston residents. Racism has historically 
divided us, preventing us from collectively working 
toward goals and policies that benefit us all, such 
as  income  and  wealth  equity,  social  services,  af-
fordable housing, and quality public education.129 
Beyond  policy  changes,  racism  keeps  us  isolated 
and  in  homogenous  social  networks,  prevent-
ing us from connecting with the diverse cultures, 
ideas, and friendships offered by our neighbors.130 
Negative images of other racial and ethnic groups 
have  created  feelings  of  fear  and  anger  toward 
those we do not know, clouding our judgment and 
creating  unnecessary  stress.131  Resilient  Boston 
provides Bostonians with the tools to address their 
own  racial  biases  and  improve  outcomes  for  all 
residents.

Racial  equity  will  also  help  improve  the  local 
economy  for  everyone.  People  of  color  make  up 

an increasingly large share of Boston’s workforce. 
Removing  oppressive  economic  barriers  that 
they face will lead to a stronger overall workforce, 
a  more  competitive  local  economy,  and  greater 
community  wealth.132  Decades  of  research  sug-
gest that social diversity makes us more creative, 
diligent,  and  innovative,  and  makes  us  better  at 
working  toward  consensus.133  Recent  research 
also indicates that as cities grow more diverse as 
a result of immigration, wages tend to increase for 
all workers, regardless of income bracket.134

By  confronting  racial  divisions  and  bias,  we  can 
build resilience for all Bostonians. We can improve 
the economy, the systems that we rely on, and our 
collective  well-being.  Beyond  these  benefits,  ad-
vancing racial equity is fair, just, and our responsi-
bility as a city. Resilient Boston provides concrete 
actions to advance racial equity across the city and 
improve the lives of all Bostonians.

EMBEDDING RESILIENCE 
AND RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS 
PLANS

A major goal of Resilient Boston is to bring together other major Boston planning efforts into one coor-
dinated strategy to leverage investment, maximize benefits, streamline efficiencies across implementa-
tion agencies, and embed racial equity and social justice.

IMAGINE BOSTON 2030, Boston’s first comprehen-
sive citywide plan in 50 years, creates a framework 
to preserve and enhance Boston, while embracing 
growth as a means to address our challenges and 
make the city stronger and more inclusive.

1.  AGE-FRIENDLY  BOSTON  challenges  the  city’s 
public  agencies,  community  groups,  businesses, 
and cultural, educational, and religious institutions 
to  consider  how  changes  to  policy  and  practice 
can enhance the quality of life for Boston’s aging 
residents.

2. BOSTON CREATES calls for an “arts and culture 
renaissance” in Boston—weaving arts, culture, and 
creativity into the whole fabric of city life.

3.  BOSTON’S  WORKFORCE:  An  Assessment  of 
Labor Market Outcomes and Opportunities takes 
stock  of  the  current  and  projected  labor  market 
conditions  facing  Boston  residents,  and  under-
scores  the  pressing  need  for  education  and  job 
training resources for residents.

4.  BUILD  BPS  provides  a  strategic  framework  for 
facilities  investments,  as  well  as  curriculum  and 
instruction reforms that are aligned with the dis-
trict’s  educational  vision.  BuildBPS  establishes 
a  $1  billion  commitment  over  10  years  of  invest-
ments, more than double the capital spending on 
BPS facilities over the last decade.

5.  CITY  OF  BOSTON  SMALL  BUSINESS  PLAN  is 
a  road  map  that  will  guide  the  City’s  approach 
to  supporting  small  businesses  as  they  start  and 
grow in Boston. The plan reflects the commitment 
to understanding the needs of Boston’s small busi-
ness community and streamlining small business 
services.

6. CLIMATE READY BOSTON is an initiative to de-
velop climate-resilient solutions that will prepare 
our city for climate change.

7. ECONOMIC INCLUSION AND EQUITY AGENDA 
seeks to harness growth to create a Boston that is 
inclusive  and  provides  ladders  of  opportunity  for 
all—women,  minorities,  veterans,  new  Bostonians, 
children,  individuals  with  disabilities,  and  seniors 
in every Boston neighborhood.

8. GO BOSTON 2030 is a City of Boston initiative to 
envision a bold transportation future for Boston for 
the next five, ten, and 15 years.

9.  HOUSING  A  CHANGING  CITY:  BOSTON  2030 
outlines  a  plan  to  produce  53,000  units  of  hous-
ing to accommodate population growth and cre-
ate a city where all Bostonians, regardless of race, 
age, economic status, or physical ability, can find a 
place to call home.

10.  OPEN  SPACE  AND  RECREATION  PLAN, 
2015-2021  presents  the  process,  analysis,  plan 
goals, and objectives for improving and protecting 
open space in Boston.

RESILIENCE AND 
RACIAL EQUITY LENS

Boston’s  Resilience  and  Racial  Equity  Lens  is  an 
approach  to  looking  at  policies  and  programs  to 
understand:  how  they  may  be  able  to  maximize 
resilience investments; how they may be inadver-
tently increasing racial inequities and social injus-
tices; and how we can intentionally take action to 
address these challenges.

For Resilient Boston, we focus on assessing a pol-
icy’s  or  practice’s  resilience  value  based  on  the 
multiple benefits that can be achieved if we con-

sciously  ask  key  questions  about  maximizing  in-
vestments that strengthen our resilience.

We have elevated equity as the core imperative to 
achieve  citywide  resilience,  and  we  are  commit-
ted  to  deliberately  measuring  the  resilience  and 
racial equity values of our initiatives. The National 
Academy  of  Public  Administration  has  created  a 
framework  for  evaluating  equity,  which  we  will 
employ, using the four distinct categories listed on 
the facing page.135

OUTCOMES: Examination of whether policies and 
programs have the same impact for all groups and 
individuals served. This is different from the criteria 
below: It is a focus on outputs and results versus 
procedures and inputs.

PROCEDURES:  Examination  of  questions  of  fair-
ness  within  existing  policies  and  programs  relat-
ed  to:  procedural  rights  (due  process),  treatment 
(equal protection), and application of eligibility re-
quirements or criteria (equal rights). This includes 
fairness in management practices such as hiring, 
promotion, and awarding of contracts.

ACCESS: Review of current policies, services, and 
practices  to  determine  the  level  of  access  to  ser-
vices/benefits and analysis of reasons for unequal 
access.

QUALITY: Review of the level of consistency in the 
quality of existing services delivered to groups and 
individuals.

WHO IS DISPROPORTIONATELY 
BURDENED?
Resilient  Boston  is  focused  on  advancing  racial 
equity, but it also recognizes the intersectionality 
of people of color with other groups experiencing 
social injustices. The Resilience and Racial Equity 
Lens  asks  for  whom  there  are  differences.  We 
begin with race, but the question is also an oppor-
tunity to look at other categories of people facing 
persistent inequities.

RESILIENCE AND RACIAL EQUITY VALUE
Each initiative within Resilient Boston will contribute to both resilience and racial equity within our city, 
often  at  multiple  scales.  We  describe  these  contributions  as  “resilience  and  racial  equity  values.”  The 
chart below describes how the resilience and racial equity value contributes to the impact of each initia-
tive within Resilient Boston, at levels ranging from the individual to citywide. In addition, each initiative 
throughout this Strategy highlights these values graphically, noting how the initiative contributes to re-
silience and racial equity at the various scales. For more detail, please refer to the Summary of Initiatives 
located in the Appendix on page 136.

organizations to connect in a way that fosters social 
cohesion so we can draw on each other’s strengths 
in circumstances both ordinary and extraordinary. 

We envision one Boston where race and class do 
not determine our residents’ ability to thrive, heal, 
and connect in daily life or during emergencies.

GUIDING  PRINCIPLE:  The  only  way  to 
create  citywide  resilience  is  to  embed 
racial  equity,  social  justice,  and  social 
cohesion within infrastructure, environ-
mental, social, and economic aspects of 
resilience. We are putting people first. 

Historically,  acute  shocks  and  chronic 
stresses have disproportionately affect-
ed low-income communities of color.135 
The  Strategy  development  process  re-
vealed the need for a framework within 
which  opportunities 
for  advancing 
equity  Goals  could  be  identified  and 
prioritized.  This  means  that  policies 
must  be  analyzed  for  their  impact  on 
historically  vulnerable  and  under-re-
sourced populations.

Resilient Boston calls for the evaluation

RESILIENT BOSTON: INTRODUCTIONA GUIDE TO THE RESILIENCE STRATEGY

A GUIDE TO THE 
RESILIENCE STRATEGY

Resilient Boston is an integrated set of collaboratively developed Visions, Goals, and 
Initiatives that collectively position Boston to create sustainable change and deliver 
equitable results to strengthen our citywide resilience. The following are descrip-
tions of each part of the Strategy:

Visions:  Aspirational  views  of  the  future  that  we 
believe  will  lead  to  an  equitable  and  Resilient 
Boston.

Goals:  Proposed  ways  of  achieving  the  Visions 
based  on  the  highest-priority  needs  identified  in 
the community engagement process.

Initiatives: Policies, programs, or practices that the 
City and partners will implement to help reach the 
Goals. 

Actions:  Concrete  steps  that  illustrate  how  we 
plan to advance each initiative.

Targets:  Measures  for  tracking  progress  toward 
achieving the Visions, Goals, and Initiatives within 
the Resilience Strategy. These targets are meant to 
be starting points to help us establish pathways for 
measuring the achievements of our Goals moving 
forward.

Timeframe: The general amount of time required 
to implement an action. These timeframes include:

•  Short term: Within one year

•  Midterm: Within two to three years

•  Long term: Within four to five years

RESILIENCE QUALITIES
Resilient systems withstand, respond to, and adapt 
more readily to shocks and stresses to bounce back 
stronger after tough times, and live better in good 
times. Extensive research has shown that resilient 
cities  demonstrate  seven  qualities  that  Resilient 
Boston is incorporating to advance resilience and 
racial equity within the city.

Throughout  this  document,  these  icons  will  be 
used to illustrate the qualities of resilience present 
in our Initiatives.

Boston will reflect upon its history and confront present 
realities  of  racism  in  daily  life  and  during  emergencies. 
Additionally,  we  will  increase  the  ability  of  all  residents, 
especially  historically  marginalized  communities,  to  act 
and  partner  with  each  other,  government,  and  private 
and nonprofit organizations during good times and crisis.

Boston  will  create  a  shared  sense  of  ownership  across 
residents,  community  organizations,  and  business-

Boston  will  enhance  infrastructure  to  withstand  shocks 
and  stresses,  while  including  the  needs  and  strengths 
of  marginalized  communities.  We  will  adapt  to  chang-
ing circumstances and emergencies by facilitating rapid 
recovery  that  (1)  doesn’t  worsen  existing  inequities  and 
(2)  proactively  advances  racial  equity,  social  justice,  and 
social cohesion.

 VISION 1: REFLECTIVE CITY, STRONGER PEOPLEVISION 1: OVERVIEW OF GOALS

VISION 

REFLECTIVE CITY,  
STRONGER PEOPLE

We  envision  a  city  where  our  government  leads  by  exam-
ple to proactively institutionalize racial equity within its pro-
grams and policies, while encouraging other organizations 
to do the same; where Bostonians engage with each other 
to  heal  and  strengthen  our  connections;  and  where  com-
munities  are  trained  and  equipped  to  support  each  other 
and partner with government, businesses, and community 
organizations in the face of shocks and stresses.

GOAL  1.1:  Acknowledge  the  damage  that  systemic  racism 
continues to inflict on our communities and develop delib-
erate institutional approaches to achieve and sustain racial 
equity in Boston policies, practices, and culture. 

GOAL 1.2: Facilitate an open, ongoing dialogue for healing, 
learning, and action to address racism and strengthen social 
cohesion in communities.
GOAL 1.3  Advance the ongoing development of communi-
ty training for healing, well-being, and preparedness in the 
face of chronic stresses and traumatic events.

Racial inequity is a multilayered problem facing Boston. The effects of racism 
limit opportunities for residents of color, create unnecessary barriers across 
races, and prevent social cohesion. By not tackling the effects of racism at an 
institutional  level,  we  miss  opportunities  for  collective  action  across  shared 
struggles and hinder our citywide resilience. Creating a reflective city with 
stronger people  means  providing  Bostonians  with  opportunities  to  under-
stand and address the root causes and effects of racism and trauma. It means 
creating  a  shared  community  understanding  of  how  racism  operates  in  its 
many forms, to combat the traumatic impacts of persistent systemic racism 

44 

Resilient Boston

VISION 1: REFLECTIVE CITY, STRONGER PEOPLEVISION 1: OVERVIEW OF GOALS

and  social  injustices  that  disproportionately  burden  communities  of  color.1 
With this shared understanding, Bostonians will be able to address our own 
implicit racial bias and shift our thinking and actions to promote racial equity. 
By offering residents the tools needed to reflect upon, address, and heal from 
the residual effects of policies and practices that have institutionalized ineq-
uity, we will grow stronger together as people and as a city.

In a 2005 study, Boston res-idents reported their levels of perceived discrimination in a variety of social settings. The results indicate that Black and Latinx/Hispanic respondents faced greater perceived discrimination than their White counter-parts in almost every cate-gory, revealing the persistent nature of racism. Additional research indicates discrim-ination can sometimes be hard to detect in isolated incidents; when experiences between people of color and White people are com-pared, however, discrep-ancies in treatment more clearly emerge.3Photo Credit: Teen EmpowermentVISION 1: REFLECTIVE CITY, STRONGER PEOPLEVISION 1: OVERVIEW OF GOALS

GOAL 1.1  Acknowledge the damage that system-
ic racism continues to inflict on our communities 
and  develop  deliberate  institutional  approaches 
to achieve and sustain racial equity in Boston poli-
cies, practices, and culture. 

Advancing  resilience  and  racial 
equity will require a citywide effort 
to acknowledge the extent to which 
racism has become entrenched in 
Boston’s 
institutions—public  and 
private—over  generations.  Recently 
on the national stage, highly visible 
instances  of  police  brutality  com-
mitted against unarmed people of 
color have shed light on one specif-
ic  way  in  which  implicit  racial  bias  and  institutional  racism  impact  people 
of  color.  What  are  not  often  reported  and  discussed,  however,  are  the  less 
obvious but pervasive, everyday ways in which racism operates. For instance, 
implicit  racial  bias  and  discrimination  influence  policies  and  practices  in  a 
way that contributes to inequitable outcomes for Bostonians of color, includ-
ing higher levels of stress,4 residential segregation,5 greater difficulty in finding 
employment,6 and harsher treatment by the criminal justice system.7 The City 
is  leading  by  example  by  acknowledging  the  effects  of  entrenched  racism 
and developing policies, programs, and practices that promote and advance 
racial equity. We will partner with private and nonprofit organizations to sup-
port their own efforts to do the same.

IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS
Implicit racial bias describes unconscious attitudes and stereotypes about different racial groups. These 
attitudes unintentionally affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in ways that negatively impact 
people of color. While these biases may not necessarily always align with our declared beliefs or values, 
they develop in our subconscious impulses over our lives, beginning at a very early age, through direct 
and indirect messages. By addressing our implicit racial bias, we can take the necessary steps to ensure 
our actions are not perpetuating inequity.

GOAL 1.2  Facilitate an open, ongoing 
dialogue  for  healing,  learning,  and 
action to address racism and strength-
en social cohesion in communities.

Beyond  acknowledging  past  trauma,  Bostonians  will  be  made  stronger  by 
engaging  in  an  honest  and  transparent  dialogue  about  tackling  systemic 
racism at a personal, community, and citywide level. One of the most famous 
and  visible  catalysts  of  racial  trauma  in  Boston’s  recent  past  was  the  vola-
tile response to the court’s efforts to desegregate Boston Public Schools in 
the 1970s. This trauma has been internalized by many residents who haven’t 
been  given  the  tools  to  process  these  events  and  their  long-term  impacts. 
Given the opportunity to understand, reflect upon, and cope with this type of 
trauma, Bostonians will be equipped to eliminate their own prejudices over 
the longer term. Once every Bostonian has the capacity to understand, reflect 
upon, and cope with the trauma resulting from both past and ongoing im-
pacts of systemic racism, we will be a much more resilient city. We will pro-
vide Bostonians with opportunities to collectively confront racism and heal 
from its impacts by hosting community conversations about Bostonians’ ev-
eryday experiences with racism and strategies for action.

GOAL  1.3  Advance  the  ongoing  development  of 
community  training  for  healing,  well-being,  and 
preparedness  in  the  face  of  chronic  stresses  and 
traumatic events.

Equipping  Bostonians  with  the  tools  that  they  need  to  heal  from  chronic 
stresses and traumatic events will make our families and communities more 
resilient.  Often,  the  most  immediate,  accessible,  and  impactful  support  to 
individuals comes from their closest neighbors and immediate social networks. 
Community  leaders,  such  as  school  principals,  clergy  members,  and  sports 
coaches,  are  often  best  positioned  to  identify  those  who  require  trauma-
related  health  interventions.  While  resources  to  support  such  interventions 
have typically been focused on community response to emergency events, 
trauma  also  arises  from  long-term  community  stresses—such  as  long-term 
poverty and neighborhood violence—but often goes unaddressed.10 We will 
bolster community-based interventions9 that support overall mental health 
and well-being in the face of chronic stresses and trauma, especially those 
faced  by  children  and  youth,  by  building  an  ongoing  trauma-response 
infrastructure at the neighborhood level.11

PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT

When traumatic events occur in our 
neighborhoods, the impacts extend 
far beyond the persons immediate-
ly  affected  by  those  events.12  This 
graphic illustrates that the impacts 
of trauma can affect nearby witness-
es, friends and family, and the com-
munity as a whole. Estimates show 
that  for  every  person  immediately 
injured or impacted by a traumatic 
event, four to ten secondary victims 
suffer  from  psychological  stress  as 
a  result.  Recent  studies  show  that 
trauma  can  even  be  passed  down 
through new generations.13

Launch Racism, Equity, and Leadership 
(REAL) Resilience Program

Incorporate  resilience  and  racial  equity  into  City  policies  and  pro-
  WHAT   
cesses through a resilience program that includes trainings, data collection, 
monitoring,  and  sharing.  In  an  effort  to  understand  the  full  impacts  of  our 
policies, programs, and practices on communities of color, the Mayor’s Office 
of  Resilience  and  Racial  Equity  (MORRE)  will  convene  an  internal  group  of 
cross-departmental representatives to guide the program’s implementation. 

  WHY    Throughout American history, public policies have largely reinforced 
systemic  racism  and  resulted  in  disproportionately  negative  impacts  on 
people of color, both intentionally14 and unintentionally.15 In order to effec-
tively combat the legacy of inequity resulting from these policies in Boston, 
we are committed to developing innovative approaches to public policy that 
proactively advance racial equity. Regular internal City government training 
opportunities  will  reinforce  the  City’s  commitment  to  resilience  and  racial 
equity goals and ensure that all facets of decision-making, from daily polic-
ing of our communities to long-term housing decisions, consistently move us 
closer to racial equity.

EMBEDDING THE RESILIENCE AND  
RACIAL EQUITY LENS WITHIN IMAGINE BOSTON 2030

Throughout the development of Imagine Boston 2030 (IB2030), 
the City worked to incorporate the principles of Resilient Boston 
into the planning process. Specifically, we made sure that the 
following principles and questions were being addressed in the 
IB2030 plan:

1.   What was the impetus for this policy, program, or practice, 

and what gaps or unmet needs does it fill?

2.   Where will the effects of this action be most felt, and what 

is the rationale for the selection of these geographies?

3.   Which communities will likely be most impacted by this policy, program, or practice, both 

intentionally and unintentionally, and how have these groups been engaged in its development?

4.   How will this action be monitored over time and responsive to changing community needs?

MORRE will continue to partner with other City agencies and departments to leverage the Resilience 
and Racial Equity Lens throughout the implementation of IB2030 initiatives.

Partner with Boston Organizations 
to Advance Racial Equity

  WHAT    Engage businesses and nonprofit partners to join the City in advanc-
ing racial equity by addressing inequities within their organizations and in-
dustries, and share best practices. 

 RESILIENCE QUALITIES 

  WHY    The public sector alone cannot bring about racial equity. Since orga-
nizations  across  all  sectors  are  impacted  by  implicit  racial  bias,  they  unin-
tentionally contribute to the pervasiveness of the problem. Collective efforts 
across  public,  private,  and  nonprofit  organizations  throughout  Boston  are 
needed.  We  all  have  the  opportunity  to  learn  from  both  experts  and  each 
other to address this challenge and create collective change in our city. While 
the City is leading by example by prioritizing resilience and racial equity, it 
is equally important for Boston’s non-government partners to also embrace 
these principles to truly create systemic change.

A TRANSFORMATIONAL APPROACH
Targeting  racial  inequity  at  a  systemic  level  requires  a  comprehensive  ap-
proach. Beyond working to change individual policies and practices, we must 
also transform our entire systems of thinking and acting so that racial equity 
is deliberately embedded into every facet of our collective decision-making. 
Adopting  this  transformational  approach  is  no  simple  task;  changing  Bos-
ton’s  decision-making  culture  will  take  time  and  effort,  but  the  impacts  of 
this approach will be much more significant than those that may result from 
smaller-scale interventions.

How the Private Sector Can Lead: 
PricewaterhouseCoopers Case Study
In the summer of 2016, our country was concerned, saddened, and anxious follow-
ing shootings in Dallas, Baton Rouge, and St. Paul. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) 
U.S. Senior Partner Tim Ryan wrote his staff to check in, and messages poured back 
from employees emotionally affected by the series of violent and divisive events.

What he heard was how much people wanted to 
connect with others to process what was happen-
ing. So Tim invited everyone to a firmwide, ongoing, 
and candid conversation on race called ColorBrave. 
The conversations were not always easy and were 
sometimes  uncomfortable.  However,  they  better 
equipped  partners  and  employees  with  greater 
insight as they worked together, talked with their 
families,  and  interacted  with  others  in  the  com-
munities.  Tim  has  noted,  “I’m  talking  with  other 
business  leaders  because  no  single  organization 
can  solve  these  issues  alone.”  He  has  communi-
cated with other business leaders, including those 
from the World Economic Forum (WEF), an inter-
national  annual  meeting  for  global  political  and 
business elites. 

PwC didn’t stop there. As of last fall, as part of the 
firm’s commitment to develop inclusive leaders, all 
newly  hired  or  promotion-eligible  employees  are 
now  required  to  take  Blindspots  training,  which 
helps  staff  learn  about  potential  unconscious 
bias  so  they  can  be  even  more  effective  coaches 
and leaders. 

Additionally,  John  Farina,  PwC  Boston’s  market 
managing  partner,  recently  hosted  a  stand-
ing-room-only  ColorBrave  discussion  at  PwC 
Boston  with  Boston’s  Chief  Resilience  Officer  Dr. 
Atyia  Martin  as  the  guest  speaker.  He  reminded 
all  those  attending  that  “at  PwC  no  one  stands 
alone—we  are  in  this  together.”  John  also  com-
mented that “this dialogue on race has opened up 
new  perspectives  by  helping  us  see  these  issues 
through the eyes of others. It requires trust to feel 
you can bring your authentic self to work. Having 
these conversations is helping us feel more com-
fortable  with  doing  that.”  He  added,  “It  doesn’t 
happen overnight, but I think we are making prog-
ress in talking about race and how it impacts our 
employees, clients, their families, and the commu-
nity.  Our  people  of  all  races,  colors,  and  genders 
are feeling stronger for it.”

VISION 1: REFLECTIVE CITY, STRONGER PEOPLEINITIATIVE 3

Connect Bostonians to Reflect 
and Confront Racial Inequity

  WHAT    Create opportunities for Bostonians to reflect on the city’s history of 
racism, inequity, and community strength to confront racism and build stron-
ger relationships with each other. Identify and implement new and creative 
opportunities for the City and residents to learn from one another, including 
through  community  workshops  and  digital  storytelling  in  partnership  with 
community groups, businesses, and arts and cultural organizations 

  WHY    Understanding how implicit racial bias and racism negatively affect 
people’s  lives  can  prepare  Bostonians  to  address  their  own  internal  biases 
and work toward solutions that can help dismantle systemic racism. Similarly, 
developing a shared understanding of the city’s history as it relates to racism 
will encourage Bostonians to confront today’s inequities and build upon past 
efforts by other Boston residents to build a more racially equitable city.

Increase Access to Mental Health 
and Trauma Resources

  WHAT    Expand and build upon community mental health services, includ-
ing supporting neighborhood trauma response teams, hosting educational 
events on topics related to mental health and trauma, and helping residents, 
particularly children and youth, find resources to address individual mental 
health needs.

  WHY    Bostonians face many forms of trauma, as a result of both unexpect-
ed shocks and chronic conditions, such as neighborhood violence, evictions, 
and systemic racism. While shock events, such as a sudden act of terrorism 
or  a  storm,  typically  trigger  large-scale  emergency  responses  that  may  in-
corporate  trauma  resources,  trauma  generated  by  long-term  stresses  often 
goes unaddressed—particularly among Bostonians who do not benefit from 
access  to  private  trauma-based  care.  By  providing  both  preventative  and  
response-based trauma resources, we will ensure that our children, families, 
and communities are stronger and better able to recover when faced with 
larger disasters.

Boston Public Health Commission
The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) is an example of a City agency making 
strides toward advancing racial equity. The Racial Justice and Health Equity Initiative 
(RJHEI)  is  BPHC’s  organizational  transformation  process  that  began  in  2011,  fol-
lowing years of work focused on overcoming health disparities in Boston. It aims 
to integrate racial justice and health equity principles into all operations—aligning 
practices, policies, processes, systems, and structures to measurably reduce health 
inequities in Boston. The RJHEI cuts across all BPHC programs and activities and 
focuses on five areas: racial justice, community engagement, equitable policy and 
practice, quality improvement, and racially explicit and data-driven health equity. 

To  achieve  this,  BPHC  designed  a  comprehen-
sive learning and practice program known as the 
RJHEI Professional Development Series (PDS). The 
series includes a required 14-hour Core Workshop, 
a  minimum  of  eight  hours  of  advanced  Practice 
Workshops,  coaching  and  consulting  upon  re-
quest,  and  ongoing  staff  dialogues.  The  Core 
Workshop,  offered  over  two  full  days,  provides 
foundational  learning  on  health  equity,  racism, 
and  racial  justice  by  exploring  Boston  neighbor-
hood health data, national and local policies, and 
examples  of  progressive  action  at  the  individual, 
community,  and  governmental  levels.  Advanced 
Practice  Workshops  and  consulting  support  staff 
capacity  to  integrate  this  learning  into  everyday 
work, while staff dialogues extend learning oppor-
tunities  to  less  formal,  ongoing  sessions  among 
staff and ensure the sustainability of the ongoing 
transformation. 

BPHC created and trained an internal facilitation 
team  to  implement  these  strategies,  engaging 
staff from across the commission as workshop fa-
cilitators  and  coaches  in  a  diverse  co-facilitation 
model. This approach allows participants to work 
with experienced practitioners in a dynamic and 
safe  environment  that  supports  open  conversa-
tion and exploration of the impacts of racism on 
health, policy, and practice. Ninety-five percent of 
BPHC’s current workforce has participated in the 
Core Workshop and other elements of PDS.

We envision a city that prioritizes community-led processes 
and community partnerships, where City services are deliv-

GOAL 2.1: Ensure employment equity and better serve all 
Bostonians by increasing the representation of the city’s di-
verse population in City government.

GOAL 2.2: Enhance decision-making capacity in City govern-
ment by bringing together our residents’ and our govern-

policies, practices, and processes.

GOAL 2.3: Improve the collaboration, evaluation, and deliv-

The effectiveness of City government hinges upon the strength of its partner-
ships and connections with those affected by its decision-making. Fostering 
truly inclusive and accessible governance means making a concerted effort to 
partner with diverse communities citywide. We are creating a culture of col-
laborative, proactive governance to ensure that our City government reflects 
Boston’s  diverse  population  and  facilitates  authentic  interactions  between 
Bostonians and City representatives. Doing so will require promoting greater 
transparency  in  policymaking  by  investing  in  data  collection  and  regularly 
reporting on our progress toward achieving our resilience and racial equity 
goals. We are building a culture that prioritizes the needs of every Bostonian, 
values inclusive community engagement, and embraces race-conscious data 
collection and analysis. This culture shift puts us on a pathway to achieving 
collaborative, transparent, and proactive governance in Boston.

Resilient City Government 

Effective City response to shocks and stresses relies upon close collaboration and coordination across its 
departments and agencies. When a broad spectrum of City resources and actors are brought together, 
the City is able to cast a wide net to support Bostonians and, crucially, coordinate with other jurisdictions 
in times of need. Boston’s response to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, for instance, demonstrat-
ed a well-integrated local, state, and federal emergency response system made possible through close 
internal coordination.1 In the long term, Boston’s resilience will depend on its ability to generate and 
sustain this degree of internal government cohesion. Vision 2 frames the City’s approach to improving 
collaboration between departments and agencies to maximize its ability to partner with Bostonians.

MODIFIED EMPLOYEE 
CAREER MODEL 
Treating employees as cus-
tomers reframes the employ-
ee career model designed to 
attract and engage (rather 
than manage) employees by 
focusing on employee deci-
sions (instead of HR process-
es) that form a continuous 
series of journeys (instead of 
a single career or role-based 
life cycle).

GOAL 2.1  Ensure employment equity and better 
serve all Bostonians by increasing the repre-
sentation of the city’s diverse population in City 
government.

Historically,  Boston’s  City  government  has  suf-
fered  from  a  lack  of  diversity,  resulting  in  a  staff 
that has not matched the racial, ethnic, and cul-
tural  makeup  of  Boston  at  large.3  By  increasing 
the representation of the city’s diverse population 
in City government, we will foster more robust un-
derstanding  and  connections  between  the  City 
and  its  residents.  The  quality  of  these  relation-
ships is critical to improving the delivery of government services in partner-
ship  with  our  communities.  The  Walsh  administration  has  taken  deliberate 
steps  to  prioritize  diversity  in  government  appointments  and  recruitment: 
the City’s cabinet is currently composed of 50 percent people of color,4 and 
44 percent of full-time hires since January 2014 have been people of color. 
In 2015, Boston Police Department’s (BPD) new recruits were composed of 
36 percent women, and BPD’s share of recruits who were Black and Latinx/
Hispanic was representative of their citywide populations.1 Despite these ef-
forts, people of color are still underrepresented across various City job types 
and  salary  ranges.5  Through  initiatives  in  Vision  1:  Reflective  City,  Stronger 
People  and  this  Vision,  Collaborative,  Proactive  Governance, we  will  sup-
port new and existing initiatives being advanced by the Human Resources 
Department and Mayor’s Office of Diversity. These initiatives are designed to 
improve human resources processes from recruitment to separation to more 
intentionally engage employees and Bostonians of color. We will also invest in 
new programs to increase the retention of existing employees of color.

The City’s Diversity Dashboard, an online plat-
form  released  in  May  2016,  allows  Bostonians 
to  track  the  City’s  efforts  to  diversify  its  staff 
along racial and gender lines. Using this metric, 
City staff (not including Boston Public Schools) 
loosely mirrors Boston’s population as a whole, 
but  a  close  look  at  staff  salary  ranges  reveals 
wide discrepancies between employees across 
race  and  gender.  For  instance,  people  of  col-
or  are  severely  underrepresented  in  positions 
earning  more  than  $60,000  per  year.  Explore

GOAL 2.2  Enhance decision-making capacity in 
City government by bringing together our res-

knowledge and skills to better develop policies, 
practices, and processes.

Bringing  more  voices  into  the  decision-making  process  will  help  us  better 
understand and address the needs of all Bostonians. Recent citywide public 
engagement  efforts,  such  as  those  deployed  through Go Boston 2030 and 
Imagine Boston 2030, have successfully engaged Bostonians in physical and 
digital  spaces  through  various  interactive  mediums,  and  have  favored  con-
tinued engagement over one-time interactions. We will establish resources 
for  City  agencies  to  learn  from  and  build  upon  these  and  other  successful 
models  of  community  partnership  from  Boston  and  around  the  world.  We 
will also launch a multimedia platform to facilitate interactive engagement 
with Resilient Boston and the sharing of relevant readings, videos, and other 
resources.

GOAL 2.3  Improve the collaboration, evaluation, 
and delivery of City services to better meet the 
needs of all Boston residents.

Proactive governance necessitates the ongoing, transparent tracking of key 
performance  indicators.  Tracking  these  indicators  enables  the  government 
and public to mutually identify unaddressed needs and collaborate on solu-
tions, while holding the City accountable to its own goals. The City current-
ly publishes information on its service delivery performance using an online 
metrics aggregator called CityScore (boston.gov/cityscore). While this data is 
useful in keeping government accountable for its citywide performance, the 
information provided by the platform is limited by its broad scope—there is 
no  mechanism  by  which  Bostonians  can  track  City  service  delivery  in  their 
own  neighborhoods,  for  instance.  We  commit  to  improving  transparency 
and promoting greater accountability by expanding this platform to include 
neighborhood-level data.

Bostonians  more  effectively.  We  will  reframe  community  engagement  in  a 
way that fosters constructive long-term relationships; facilitates healthy con-
flict resolution between residents and government in an open, honest, and 
equitable manner; and utilizes research, best practices, and community guid-
ance to drive optimal results.

  WHY    Some  Bostonians  have  expressed  that  they  do  not  feel  their  voices 
inform decisions that affect their own neighborhoods. When developed in-
clusively, community engagement practices can create opportunities for all 
Bostonians to have a stronger voice in how their city functions. By creating 
these opportunities, the City will be able to build and sustain public trust, and 
ensure that policies and programs are more equitable for all residents.

ACTION
Design Labs
Facilitate  collaborative  problem  solving  and  idea 
generation  across  government,  businesses,  com-
munity  organizations,  and  residents  by  hosting 
Design  Lab  workshops.  Labs  will  address  specif-
ic  challenges  being  faced  by  City  government 
and  Bostonians  to  co-create  community-driven 
solutions.  Workshops  will  advance  the  goals  of 
Resilient  Boston  by  developing  innovative  ap-
proaches to building stronger community-govern-
ment relationships while prioritizing the inclusion 
of Bostonians who are typically underrepresented 
in  government  decision-making  processes.  In  the 
short  term,  the  City’s  Department  of  Information 
and Technology (DoIT) will host Design Labs to help 
improve Boston.gov’s accessibility and functionality.

ACTION
Community Engagement 2.0 
Launch  a  community  engagement  training  and 
co-learning  series  to  catalyze  collaboration  be-
tween City employees and residents. Through the 
series, City staff and Bostonians will jointly partici-
pate in trainings to learn about existing communi-
ty engagement frameworks and develop a shared 
understanding of the processes and goals of com-
munity engagement. City agencies will share best 
practices  in,  and  lessons  learned  from,  resident 
engagement  across  City  departments.  In-person 
sessions  will  supplement  an  online  resource  for 
collaboration to facilitate sharing strategies, asking 
questions, and receiving feedback.

ACTION
Community Resilience Fellowship 
Program
Develop a fellowship program in partnership with 
MORRE and the Environment, Energy, and Open 
Space  (EEOS)  Cabinet.  This  program  will  enable 
residents  in  neighborhoods  with  high  social  vul-
nerability to participate in the implementation of 
Resilient Boston and Climate Ready Boston, pro-
viding  opportunities  for  everyday  Bostonians  to 
increase  engagement  and  preparedness  in  their 
communities.

ACTION
Youth Civic Engagement and 
Neighborhood Exploration Pilot
Launch a citywide, youth-led pilot for middle school 
students  to  increase  city  engagement,  neighbor-
hood  exploration,  and  equity  through  technolo-
gy. MORRE will partner with the Mayor’s Office of 
New  Urban  Mechanics  (MONUM)  to  support  the 
Engagement Lab at Emerson College and Niantic, 
the  creators  of  Pokémon  GO,  to  engage  youth  to 
have the power to place more than 100 PokéStops 
throughout Boston. Through an investigation and 
exploration process, young people will advocate for 
meaningful, but not always well-known, landmarks 
to become featured in the game. Through this pilot, 
we will build a foundation for future youth engage-
ment and neighborhood exploration to build civic 
skills, while advocating for resilience and equity in 
communities.

  WHAT    Establish a dynamic online platform that builds upon the initiatives 
found within Resilient Boston. This interactive resource hub will provide resi-
dents with information relevant to the Strategy, and opportunities for collab-
oration and community input. The platform will include educational materi-
als—in the form of toolkits, reports, and videos—along with Resilience Strategy 
implementation updates and information on related events.

  WHY    A recurring theme throughout the Strategy development process was 
the need for an accessible centralized online platform for Bostonians to share 
resources  and  collaborate  on  the  visions  and  goals  described  in  Resilient 
Boston. This Resilience Strategy document is a product of that process and 
features key initiatives, but does not include all of the ideas that came out 
of the engagement process. An easily accessible online portal could serve to 
elaborate on the full scope of initiatives developed throughout the Strategy 
development process and would allow Bostonians to take part in its continual 
development and implementation.

ACTION
Interactive Resilience Strategy
Develop  an  interactive  Resilience  Strategy  that 
is transparent, accessible, and updated regular-
ly to reflect the City’s progress. Because Resilient 
Boston is meant to be iterative and collaborative, 
community, government, and business partners 
will  be  able  to  submit  requests  to  include  new 
or ongoing initiatives that support the Strategy’s 
Visions and Goals. 

ACTION
Relevant Resources and Tools
Identify and share relevant reports, books, videos, 
and  other  resources  available  from  our  partners 
throughout  the  city,  across  the  U.S.,  and  interna-
tionally. For example:

   Promising Practices: Case studies that high-
light existing efforts across the city that support 
the Resilience Strategy.

   Conversation Tools: Guides to help community 
members and organizations conduct effective 
dialogues that acknowledge and understand 
racism, develop shared language, and take ac-
tions that advance racial equity.

   MORRE Learning Series Updates: Access to 
upcoming events that advance the goals of 
Resilient Boston, either hosted or supported by 
MORRE. For more information on the MORRE 
Learning Series, see the Action titled “Dialogue

Create a Funding Pipeline for 
Community-Led Resilience Initiatives

  WHAT    Connect  grassroots  community  initiatives  that  align  with  Resilient 
Boston with a diverse portfolio of funding opportunities to create a pipeline 
for community investments. We will prioritize underserved communities to 
expand  their  access  to  resources  and  foster  increased  collaboration  within 
and across neighborhoods. 

  WHY    Achieving the visions and goals of the Resilience Strategy will require 
the contribution of all communities. However, we recognize that communi-
ties of color can have limited information about, and access to, the resources 
that they need to improve their communities and strengthen their resilience.

Communities typically have many “third spaces,” or places that are between 
home (our “first spaces”) and work (our “second spaces”) that contribute to our 
collective well-being. It is in these third spaces that we frequently connect and 
create with others—parks, barber shops, and coffee shops are all examples. In 
addition to any economic or transactional values that third spaces bring to a 
neighborhood, they also contribute to the cultural and social resilience of our 
city, and must be invested in, continuously updated, and designed from the 
bottom up. Specific funding will be designated to support our communities’ 
priorities, including enhancing third spaces.

Youth Lead the Change: 
Participatory Budgeting 

Boston’s participatory budgeting pro-
cess provides an opportunity for resi-
dents to determine how to best utilize 
government resources. 

Boston boasts one of the first instances of youth-
led  participatory  budgeting,  an  initiative  that 
began  in  2013  and  allows  youth  ages  12—25  to 
determine  how  to  spend  $1  million  of  the  City’s 
capital budget.10 For Boston’s process, we have al-
lowed young people, particularly through the Mayor’s Youth Council, to be involved in both the budget 
allocation and the development of particular projects under consideration. The partnership between the 
City of Boston and the Participatory Budgeting Project (PBP) allows for young Bostonians to be at the 
forefront of engaging their fellow youth and being a crucial part of decision-making.

The goals of Youth Lead the Change are to: 

1.   increase youth power through engagement in meaningful decision-making process-

es, proving that young people are the solution, not the problem; 

2.   allow all voices to be heard in the democratic process; 

3.   build stronger, safer, and healthier communities by bringing neighborhoods together, 

solving community problems, and developing projects that will improve the wellbe-
ing of all residents; 

4.   strengthen a citywide sense of pride, solidarity, and equality by creating a uni-

fied Boston across neighborhoods where everyone feels part of a growing 
community; and 

5.   develop pathways to civic life by creating an entry point for young people to become 

civically engaged and learn about the city and government.

Through this process the City has been able to collect valuable information about youth ideas and opin-
ions. The process has revealed ways in which the City of Boston has been able to leverage the participato-
ry budgeting model and process to positively and successfully engage youth citywide. Most importantly, 
it sheds light on many of the challenges associated with the participatory budgeting process, and pro-
vides data about how youth in Boston view City government and programs.

particular communities. We will use this analysis to inform our recommenda-
tions on policies, programs, and practices that advance equity.

  WHY    Boston is already at the forefront of City data collection and open data 
access for the public, aggregating data on City services, geographic features, 
demographics, and more. The City will build upon ongoing efforts by utilizing 
new and existing data sources to advance resilience and racial equity across 
the city. There is an opportunity, for instance, to further break down data by 
race  and  neighborhood  to  identify  critical  gaps  and  opportunities  for  im-
provement. This will ensure that as the city grows and improves, gains will be 
seen across all populations.

LIFE COURSE OUTCOMES1 

This graphic illustrates the idea that when certain conditions are met over the course of our develop-
ment, they can improve our financial stability and life outcomes. These age benchmarks are estimates 
that show approximately when goals can be met to reduce economic barriers. There is a need for strong 
networks and communal support across the entire course of one’s life, not just at earlier or later stages. 
Support at individual junctures is necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve economic stability.

While Boston’s economy is growing, that growth is not shared equitably. A young Bostonian living in one 
neighborhood faces vastly different outcomes from another living just a few minutes away. Many studies 
show that a Bostonian’s race dictates his or her access to quality affordable housing, digital technology, 
and educational opportunities, all of which are foundational building blocks for intergenerational wealth 
building. Providing equitable economic opportunity for all means eliminating long-standing barriers to 
wealth building for Boston’s communities of color. 

Throughout this chapter, we will highlight challenges and opportunities for Boston residents to meet 
these conditions and remain on the path to financial stability. Beneath the timeline, you will find the 
specific corresponding Initiatives that are designed to help Bostonians achieve these milestones. The 
Initiatives outlined in this Vision will support Boston residents to stay on the course to financial stability 
at every step throughout their lives.

Equitable economic opportunity also means providing safe, affordable, and 
stable housing for all Bostonians. Though we are beginning to see the soft-
ening of rents,6 21 percent of Boston households spend more than half their 
incomes on housing.7 Low-income neighborhoods with sizable communities 
of color—notably East Boston, Mattapan, and Roxbury—feel the effects of this 
trend most acutely.8 Through the actions laid out in Housing a Changing City: 
Boston 2030, the City has added more than 12,000 new units and has an ad-
ditional 7,237 under construction, as of December 2016. More than 1,100 new 
units are designated as affordable for low-income, non-elderly residents, with 
264 new units for low-income seniors that are either permitted or complet-
ed.9 The mayor has also recently submitted an anti-displacement package to 
the Massachusetts legislature.10 We will continue to advocate for its passage 
while providing targeted home-ownership assistance to curtail displacement.

23  percent  of  Boston 
Public  Schools  (BPS)  facilities  are  connected  to  the  Boston  Fiber  Optic 
Network (BoNet), leaving out some of the communities with the highest con-
centrations of residents of color.13 In recent years, Boston has made strides 
in providing free public wifi for all 20 commercial districts in the city’s Main 
Streets neighborhoods program,14 with the majority of access points located 
in Roxbury and Dorchester.15 The City of Boston has also supported Tech Goes 
Home,  an  award-winning  initiative  that  removes  barriers  to  technology  for 
vulnerable communities.16 We will build upon these initiatives by investing in 
an expansion of broadband in schools and within the city’s subsidized hous-

GOAL 3.4    Prioritize equitable 
education opportunities to close the 
gap for young people of color.

The  path  toward  intergenerational  wealth  building  for  Bostonians  of  color 
begins with access to a high-quality education. It ensures every Bostonian’s 
lifelong economic opportunity. Today, 15 percent of Boston residents above 
the age of 25 lack a high school diploma, and close to one-third of this popu-
lation lives in poverty, reflecting the strong relationship between educational 
attainment and earnings.18 Moreover, educational opportunity varies widely 
by  race:  the  graduation  rate  for  White  students  is  13.2  percentage  points 
higher than that of their Black peers.19 We will work to close gaps for young 
Bostonians of color by expanding early childhood programs, promoting a resil-
ience-based approach to education throughout the city, and fostering great-
er links between Boston’s K–12 and postsecondary educational institutions.

SHOCKS AND 
STRESSES

 

In order to address economic inequality, Resilient Boston takes a “com-
munity wealth building” approach to local economic development. Unlike 
traditional economic development strategies that focus mostly on attract-
ing outside firms for the purpose of increasing the total number of jobs, a 
community wealth building approach also promotes growing local assets 
and ownership, creating inclusive jobs that pay living wages, and devel-
oping  collaborative,  supportive  ecosystems  to  create  a  “new  normal”  of 
economic activity.

Link Bostonians to Jobs, 
Entrepreneurship, and 
Financial Empowerment Tools

  WHAT    Ensure  all  Bostonians  have  access  to  emerging  growth  industries 
and  asset-building  opportunities.  The  City  will  conduct  a  detailed  study  of 
Boston’s  economic  opportunity  ecosystem  to  forecast  emerging  fields,  un-
filled jobs, and entrepreneurial opportunities. This study will inform city policy 
makers, organizations, and communities in designing workforce efforts to link 
Bostonians to these opportunities while ensuring that people of color benefit. 
The City will continue to integrate resources for personal financial success and 
wealth building through the existing Office of Financial Empowerment.

  WHY    Total employment in Boston is expected to increase by 110,000, or 15 
percent, from 2014 to 2030.21 Previous jobs forecasts conducted by the City 
have  identified  growing  industries,  such  as  healthcare  and  high-tech  man-
ufacturing, and the City will build upon this research to identify new oppor-
tunities and prioritize investments in workforce development programs that 
prepare Bostonians of color for these occupations. Securing good-paying jobs 
is essential for building wealth and achieving economic resilience.

mission to link those seeking financial security and wealth generation with access to capital, financial 
education, and financial services. We will continue to ensure Bostonians receive these critical services 
at the City’s Financial Opportunity Centers and further integrate into other social services with City and 
community partners.

Remove Barriers Facing 
Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs

  WHAT    Support small business development for people of color by imple-
menting  a  planning  process  that  is  friendly  to  small  businesses  and  devel-
oping  targeted  educational  resources  for  small-business  owners.  This  mul-
tipronged  approach  will  be  coordinated  with  the  Small  Business  Center, 
announced by Mayor Walsh in 2016, and will complement the Center’s role 
as a one-stop  shop offering tools for Boston entrepreneurs.

  WHY    Despite the fact that people of color make up 53 percent of the city’s 
population, only 32 percent of Boston’s businesses identify as minority owned. 
Entrepreneurs of color face obstacles, including limited access to established 
business  networks,  capital,  and  affordable  real  estate  options.24  Small  busi-
nesses  disproportionately  bear  the  burden  of  emergencies  and  disasters, 
including the impacts of climate change.25 Furthermore, current zoning for 
businesses  is  inconsistent  across  the  city,  resulting  in  neighborhoods  that 
do not have access to certain types of small businesses (as consumers and 
owners)  because  of  inequitable  zoning  and  an  unclear  process.  Enabling 
small  business  creation,  growth,  and  stability  will  increase  the  amount  of 
middle-income jobs available to Boston residents.

ACTION
Small Business Lending in Historically 
Underserved Neighborhoods
Provide MWBE small businesses with information 
and support to access newly developed small busi-
ness loans that will target strategic industries and 
neighborhoods  to  ensure  that  these  small  busi-
nesses and entrepreneurs also have the opportuni-
ty to thrive. In March 2017, Mayor Walsh launched 
a  business  capital  and  finance  unit  to  distribute 
flexible  gap  financing  and  microloans  to  restau-
rants, immigrant-owned businesses, women- and 
minority-owned  businesses,  and  industrial  small 
businesses within the City of Boston. These flexible 
loans  will  assist  businesses  in  rehabbing  existing 
buildings,  new  construction  and  expansion,  pur-
chasing equipment, and startup costs.

ACTION
Business Zoning and Design Changes 
Conduct a process to reassess current commercial 
zoning as well as the zoning process in partnership 
with the Boston Planning & Development Agency 
(BPDA).  The  desired  outcome  is  to  remove  zon-
ing obstacles that currently hinder small business 
growth, particularly within communities of color.

ACTION
Small Business Resources 
Create  educational  resources  in  partnership  with 
the Office of Small Business Development that spe-
cifically target small-business owners. MORRE will 
provide  technical  assistance  to  apply  a  resilience 
and  racial  equity  lens  for  the  development  and 
distribution of these resources to ensure that they  
provide information on the wide array of challeng-
es facing small-business owners, including climate 
change  preparedness  tools;  are  translated  into 
multiple languages for widespread reach; and are 
inclusive of all types of small businesses, including 
worker  co-ops  and  other  employee-owned  busi-
ness models. Additionally, the Office of Small Busi-
ness  Development  has  expanded  a  multitude  of 
mentorship  opportunities  for  minority  entrepre-
neurs,  minority  and  women  tech  entrepreneurs, 
and  an  industry-specific  mentorship  network  for 
retail and restaurant businesses.26

ACTION
Leverage Anchor Institutions to Support Small Businesses
Identify ways to increase large institutions’ local spending with the city’s small businesses by sharing data 
and best practices, making connections, and jointly investing in supplier development and support. In 
March 2016, the City of Boston released the Citywide Small Business Plan, a roadmap that will guide the 
City’s approach to supporting small businesses as they start and grow in Boston. One key strategy outlined 
in the plan was to launch an anchor council that will work to set goals to increase local purchasing.

Keep Bostonians in Boston:  
Addressing Housing Challenges

  WHAT    Build  upon  ongoing  efforts  of  Imagine Boston 2030  and Housing 
a Changing City to  prevent  displacement  in  Boston  by  advocating  for  the 
Mayor’s  anti-displacement  legislative  package  with  the  Commonwealth  of 
Massachusetts, increasing homeownership, and promoting home improve-
ment efforts among low-income Bostonians.

  WHY    Boston consistently ranks among the most expensive housing markets 
in the country.27 As a result of high rents and decreasing real median wages, 
a majority of Boston renters pay more than 30 percent of their incomes on 
rent.28 Conversations with residents reveal an overwhelming sense, particu-
larly among Bostonians of color, that rising housing costs are an increasing 
burden.

HOUSING A CHANGING CITY

One goal set forth in Housing a Changing City is to double the pace 
of  middle-income  workforce  housing  production,  creating  20,000 
units  citywide  by  2030.  Reaching  this  goal  will  require  15,000  new 
units of housing. Of these, approximately 4,000 units will be created 
via the Inclusionary Development Policy or from units subsidized in 
mixed-income developments.29

Home Ownership and Maintenance 
Continue to grow homeownership through down-

work  to  strengthen  Boston  Home  Center’s  (BHC) 
no-interest  loan  program  for  home  repairs,30  to 
help people stay in their homes.

ACTION
Affordable Housing Production 
Strengthen  policies  that  encourage  the  produc-
tion  and  maintenance  of  deed-restricted  low-, 
moderate-,  and  middle-income  housing.  These 
policies  include  the  Inclusionary  Development 
Policy (IDP) and Linkage Fee, the reuse of surplus 
City  parcels  as  locations  for  affordable  housing, 
and the Community Preservation Act.31

ACTION
Anti-Displacement Legislative Package 
Advocate for Mayor Walsh’s recently announced statewide anti-displacement legislative package. These 
policies would make legal representation in eviction proceedings a right; allow the City to amend the 
zoning code to protect the IDP; require landlords to notify the City in case of eviction; allow tenants and 
nonprofits to purchase properties subject to foreclosure before they are placed on the open market; and 
provide an income tax credit of $1,500 to landlords who provide unsubsidized units at below-market 
rents to qualifying households.32

Create an Economic Mobility Lab

  WHAT    Plan  development  of  an  Economic  Mobility  Lab  that  would  work 
across  City  departments  and  agencies  to  advance  economic  mobility  for 
Bostonians. The Lab would analyze existing programs and policies; highlight 
and expand interventions that are most effective; and pilot innovative, scal-
able  solutions  to  promote  economic  security  for  everyone.  Key  preliminary 
areas of focus would include programs addressing vocational training, mid-
dle-income housing, and childcare. 

  WHY    Currently, many Bostonians lack the economic resources to achieve 
self-sufficiency. Moreover, economic opportunity differs starkly by race. A lack 
of retirement and financial savings, lower homeownership rates, and rates of 
debt contribute to the long-term economic challenges facing Bostonians of 
color. These factors also mean that short-term disruptions have significantly 
greater acute impacts on these families, generating extreme stress.33

Boston Ujima Project
The  Ujima  Project  is  a  community  wealth  building  “ecosystem”  rooted  in  work-
ing-class  communities  of  color  that  seeks  to  organize  “neighbors,  workers,  busi-
ness  owners,  and  investors  to  build  a  new  community-controlled  economy 
in Greater Boston.”

these 

Ujima  brings  communi-
ty  members  together  to 
pool  resources  and  al-
locate 
resources 
democratically  to  meet 
their  own  needs.  The  Uji-
ma  Project  is  building  a 
Community Capital Fund 
that will pool savings and 
investments  from  its  diverse  membership  and 
leverage  that  equity  to  pursue  additional  capital 
from universities, union pension funds, foundation 
endowments, and local banks and credit unions. 
Ujima  then  hosts  democratic  neighborhood  as-
semblies  to  engage  members  in  a  participatory 
budgeting  exercise  to  distribute  this  capital  to 
help meet the enterprise, housing, and consumer 
needs  of  the  community.  In  August  2016,  Ujima 
organized  more  than  170  individual  community 
members  to  invest  $10,000  in  a  crowd-funding 
campaign to lend to local Ujima businesses, and 
recruited three nonprofit and private institutional 
matching investors, bringing the total investment 
fund to $20,000.

Ujima  is  also  working  to  establish  community 
standards for the kind of housing, jobs, and com-
mercial  development  needed  to  build  wealth  in 
working-class  communities  of  color.  These  stan-
dards will consider business practices, such as liv-
ing  wages,  CORI-friendly  hiring,  local  purchasing, 
environmental  impact,  and  affordability.  Local 
businesses that adopt these standards will receive 
a  special  Good  Business  certification  and  will  be 
eligible  to  join  Ujima’s  Business  Alliance,  gaining 
access to capital, technical assistance, cooperative 
purchasing, human resource programs, and other 
joint ventures to strengthen operations and mar-
ket share. Ujima will also advance campaigns for 
the  local  government  and  anchor  institutions  to 
direct  their  investments,  subsidies,  and  procure-
ment dollars to Ujima’s network of certified good 
businesses and nonprofit developers.

Programs  like  these  are  advancing  community 
wealth building in Boston. To learn more about the

In early 2016, Boston participated in an international forum to explore policies that advance equity. As 
part of the Transatlantic Policy Lab, Boston hosted experts from local government, philanthropy, think 
tanks, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector from Europe and North America in a series 
of interactive sessions to share Boston innovations, learn from Trans-Atlantic best practices, and collabo-
rate in developing programs and policies for Resilient Boston. Through informational briefings, site visits, 
and small-group discussions with community leaders and stakeholders, the Lab led to place-based rec-
ommendations to build further on innovative practices in Boston that advance equity and resilience, 
with a particular focus on policies related to education, jobs, and technology. The Lab targeted its anal-
ysis on East Boston and Roxbury. Not only did this opportunity facilitate trans-Atlantic dialogue and the 
exchange of policy innovations among Boston and global partners, but it also contributed to many of the 
initiatives featured throughout Resilient Boston. The Lab was supported by the Bertelsmann Foundation, 
with additional generous support from the Open Society Foundations, and in partnership with 100RC 
and the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

Prepare all Students for Equitable 
Postsecondary Education and Career 
Opportunities

Improve access and outcomes for students of color through equitable 
 WHAT  
educational  pathways,  supporting  all  students  so  that  they  can  succeed  in 
postsecondary education, training, and career opportunities.

 RESILIENCE QUALITIES 

 WHY   Ensuring that all BPS students graduate from high school ready to suc-
ceed in postsecondary education, training, or careers is one of the most effec-
tive ways to provide Bostonians with lifelong economic opportunities. While 
graduation rates for all students have generally increased over the past several 
years, these gains have not been equitable. For example, the graduation rate 
for White students is 13.2 percentage points higher than that of their Black 
peers.35 By working to provide all students with rigorous academic options 
and career preparation, we can reduce these gaps and promote economic 
mobility for all Bostonians.

RESTORATIVE PRACTICES IN EDUCATION
Restorative  practices  in  education  center  around  the  need  to  “restore  good 
relationships when there has been conflict or harm.” Restorative practices seek 
to resolve conflicts in a healthy and productive manner while reducing the po-
tential for future conflicts to arise. These practices can improve the well-being 
and educational outcomes of students of color across the city.36

educational  outcomes  and  engagement.  For 
instance,  the  Opportunity  Youth  Department, 
launched during the 2016–2017 school year, pro-
vides  training  and  resources  to  help  schools  ad-
dress attendance issues and to connect students 
with  additional  services  when  necessary.  BPS  is 
also  integrating  social  emotional  learning  into 
K-12  curricula  and  expanding  positive  behav-
ior intervention and support, models such as the 
Comprehensive Behavioral Health Model.

ACTION
Tuition-Free Higher Education 
Build  upon  existing  partnerships  between  BPS 
and  community  colleges  to  provide  tuition-free 
degrees for BPS graduates at four-year public col-
leges.  Currently,  full  tuition  and  mandatory  fees 
are  covered  for  eligible  BPS  graduates  to  attend 
three  community  colleges.  We  will  develop  a 
strategy  for  expanding  the  program  to  include 
four-year public colleges to help more Bostonians 
access the lifelong benefits of these valuable edu-
cational options. In addition to addressing the cost 
of higher education, the City also plans to address 
other  barriers  to  access  through  integrated  sup-
port services, such as remedial classes, and career 
navigation services.

ACTION
Dual Enrollment 
Collaborate with BPS and local higher-education 
institutions  to  introduce  a  dual-enrollment  pro-
gram that allows students to earn tuition-free col-
lege credits while in high school.

ACTION
Connect Education to Employment
Connect  emerging  employers  with  educational 
institutions to better provide Bostonians with the 
skills they need to thrive in the local economy. This 
includes  helping  Boston  residents  secure  intern-
ships, apprenticeships, and other entry points into 
the workforce.

 WHY    High-quality  pre-K  and  early  childhood  education  is  a  critical  path-
way  to  economic  opportunity.  Yet  due  to  persistent  gaps,  not  all  young 
Bostonians have access to these educational options. In addition, an import-
ant approach to helping children and youth thrive academically is support-
ing their social and emotional well-being. On average, for every $1 invested 
in Social Emotional Learning (SEL) programming, there is a return of $11.37 
There are opportunities for organizations serving children and youth to take 
a resilience-building approach to support children in need while addressing 
multiple challenges holistically.

We envision a Boston where all residents are connected to 
each other and to their city through resilient infrastructure 
and systems that meet the needs of all families. These con-
nected communities will be prepared for and can adapt to 
the urgent threat of climate change.

GOAL  4.1:  Develop  a  redundant  and  reliable  public  trans-
portation  network  to  provide  equitable  accessibility  for  all 
Bostonians.   

GOAL 4.2:  Prepare  for  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and

Boston communities to address climate change and other 
emergencies.

RESILIENCE AND RACIAL EQUITY LENS:  
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
Resilient Boston has identified specific initiatives considering environmental justice for people of color 
and low-income communities. Communities of color are often disproportionately impacted by environ-
mental shocks and stresses and are less likely to have access to the political power necessary to rectify 
these disparities.1 The City of Boston is committed to simultaneously addressing racial equity and en-
vironmental challenges through community-led plans and adaptation measures. To that end, we will 
partner closely with people of color who are already working at the grassroots level to address the poli-
cies, programs, and practices that enable environmental disparities.

Resilient Boston

VISION 4: CONNECTED, ADAPTIVE CITYVISION 4: OVERVIEW OF GOALS 

Building a connected, adaptive city will require us to strengthen human and 
social connections and develop the strong, reliable, and flexible physical in-
frastructure necessary to support a thriving Boston for generations to come. 
Boston is a coastal city; our waterfront assets are facing an increased risk of 
flooding, impacting our homes, jobs, and systems. The city’s public transpor-
tation accessibility and mode options are strong overall, but the current distri-
bution of transit service throughout the city leaves some communities with-
out reliable access and others with direct access but little to no redundancy 
in  the  event  of  an  interruption.2  Connecting  Bostonians  to  each  other  and 
their city means investing in resilient infrastructure to protect assets and close 
gaps  in  distribution;  it  also  means  partnering  with  communities  to  cham-
pion  resilience-building  efforts  together.  And  most  importantly,  it  means 
close partnership and collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of 
Transportation (MassDOT) to ensure that funding and infrastructure support 
this  vision.  Boston’s  transportation  system  works  in  collaboration  with  the 
state and requires a great deal of partnership and coordination between the 
state and local municipalities.

GOAL 4.1  Develop a redundant and reliable public 
transportation  network  to  provide  equitable  ac-
cessibility for all Bostonians.  

By  improving  the  re-
dundancy  and 
reli-
ability  of  our  transpor-
tation  system,  we  will 
combat  transit  disrup-
tions  caused  by  cli-
mate  change  impacts 
and  other  disruptions 
that can lead to infrastructure failure. Our goal is to ensure that all Bostonians 
can  easily  access  the  opportunities  that  Boston  has  to  offer.  Today,  Boston 
neighborhoods with high concentrations of populations of color suffer from 
the highest transportation costs, adding an additional stress to communities 
that can afford it the least. During extreme weather events, which are becom-
ing more frequent due to climate change, these vulnerable communities are 
most  affected  by  shutdowns  in  public  transit,  which  disrupt  access  to  jobs 
and can trigger lasting financial impacts.6 Go Boston 2030, the City’s 15-year 
transportation vision, advances actions that prioritize making travel predict-
able on Boston’s transit and roadway networks by developing a dense system 
of interconnected walking, biking, transit, and driving networks. We will sup-
port the implementation of these efforts by applying a resilience and racial 
equity lens to key initiatives. 

TARGETS 

  Ensure that every 
home in Boston 
will be within a 
ten-minute walk of a 
rail station or key bus 
route stop, Hubway 
station, and carshare 
by 2030

GOAL  4.2  Prepare  for  the  impacts  of  climate 
change and other threats while accelerating sus-
tainable  infrastructure,  environment,  and  com-
munities.  

A connected and adaptive Boston means that communities across the city 
can prepare for the urgent and increasing impacts of climate change. Climate 
change is leading to increased flooding in coastal and inland communities 
throughout the city, as well as a greater frequency of extreme weather events. 
The city’s summers are also getting hotter, putting Bostonians at greater risk 
of  respiratory  and  cardiovascular  diseases,  mental  health  challenges,  and 
loss of life.8 The City is advancing a robust set of targeted initiatives, through 
Greenovate Boston and Climate Ready Boston, that will prepare Bostonians 
for the effects of climate change. We will further these initiatives by develop-
ing  place-based  strategies  designed  to  make  communities  less  vulnerable 
to threats like flooding and extreme heat. We will also invest in resilient and 
affordable energy systems to ensure that our communities are not only using 
efficient and green energy, but will also remain connected during major dis-
ruptions to the energy grid following a shock.

TARGETS 

  Increase the tree 
canopy coverage, 
number of cool 
roofs, and number 
of neighborhood 
groups with es-
tablished plans for 
coping with urban 
heat island effects 
in neighborhoods 
threatened by ex-
treme heat

  Increase the number 
of critical services/

GOAL  4.3  Improve  the  collaboration  of  partners 
working  in  Boston  communities  to  address  cli-
mate change and other emergencies.  

Strategic  partnerships  between  City  government  and  Bostonians  can  pre-
pare  them  for  climate  change  impacts  by  connecting  communities  to  re-
silience-building opportunities. Communities with both formal and informal 
social networks are able to bounce back stronger no matter what challeng-
es  they  face.  However,  communities  facing  chronic  stresses—such  as  pov-
erty  or  regular  incidents  of  neighborhood  violence—may  find  preparing  for 
emergencies to be particularly difficult.  Shared climate change impacts and 
emergency  preparedness  can  provide  common  ground  to  foster  stronger 
connections between neighbors, businesses, nonprofits, and government. We 
will advance a more integrated approach that leverages existing partnerships 
between community organizations and the neighborhoods that they serve 
to build resilience from the ground up. We will achieve this by collaborating 
directly with community-based organizations already working in neighbor-
hoods  across  Boston  to  develop  strategies  to  address  the  various  effects  of 
climate change and to strengthen community preparedness.9

TARGETS 

  Increase the number 
of neighborhoods

paredness plans that 
include neighbor-
hood risks to climate 
change

  Reduce potential 
economic loss and 
any loss of life from

CIVIC COMMUNICATIONS  
INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESILIENCE
Reliable civic communications infrastructure is essential to community resilience. Whether coming to-
gether in celebration, peaceful protest, or in times of emergency, residents should be able to communi-
cate with each other, City government, and those far away. In this spirit, the City and community partners 
will explore ideas for ad hoc or agile communication systems, policy changes, and other ways  to support 
open and continuous communication processes and provide a basic communications safety net, even 
when traditional channels of communication are insufficient or otherwise unavailable.

Sea Level Rise in Boston

The  City  of  Boston  recently  released  up-to-date 
projections  related  to  future  climate  change.  The 
message that these projections send is unambig-
uous: the pace of relative sea level rise is acceler-
ating  here  in  Boston,  demanding  a  coordinated 
response. By 2050, sea levels may be as much as 
1.5  feet  higher  than  they  were  in  2000;  by  2070, 
they  may  be  as  much  as 3 feet  higher  than  they 
were then.10

The area of Boston exposed to stormwater flooding 
is projected to grow steadily throughout the cen-
tury.  As  early  as  the  2050s,  7  percent  of  the  total 
land area in the city could be exposed to frequent 
stormwater  flooding  from  10-year,  24-hour  rain 
events. As the sea level continues to rise, the likeli-
hood of major floods will increase from a 1 percent 
annual chance to a monthly reality.11

Higher  sea  levels,  along  with  increasing  extreme 
storm  and  precipitation  events,  means  increased 

flooding  along  our  shores  and  within  our  com-
munities, putting stresses on our sewer, transpor-
tation, and building infrastructure systems.12 With 
Climate Ready Boston and related planning efforts 
such  as  Resilient Boston,  we  are  readying  our-
selves,  our  communities,  and  our  homes  to  face 
these changes.

For our most vulnerable, the geographic distribu-
tion  of  coastal  and  inland  riverine  flooding  could 
mean disproportionate impacts both at home and 
work,  affecting  the  local  and  regional  economy 
through  physical  damages,  stress  factors  (mental 
stress and anxiety and lost productivity), displace-
ment  costs,  and  losses  due  to  business  interrup-
tion.13 Partnering  with  our  communities  to  better 
understand, prepare for, and mitigate climate risks 
strengthens our citywide, community, and person-
al resilience.

Advance Resilient 
Transportation Systems

  WHAT    Build a more resilient transportation network by improving access in 
key corridors, adapting transport infrastructure to climate change, and ensur-
ing equitable distribution of resources.

 RESILIENCE QUALITIES 

  WHY    More resilient and equitable transportation networks will ensure that 
all Bostonians are able to access all parts of the city safely and reliably. It also 
means  that  we  will  be  able  to  better  withstand  major  disruptions.  We  are 
putting pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users on an equal footing with mo-
tor-vehicle drivers to improve the quality of life in Boston by creating streets 
that are both great public spaces and sustainable transportation networks.  
Furthermore, by leveraging the resilience and racial equity lens and investing 
in key corridors, such as the Fairmount/Indigo line, the City of Boston and the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts are prioritizing service improvements while 
ensuring that our transportation networks meet the needs of all Bostonians. 
As we have seen in past major storms, our transit system is vulnerable to major 
disruptions  from  the  impacts  of  climate  change.14  Adapting  our  system  to 
withstand these emerging threats is critical for all Bostonians. Our sidewalks 
are an important part of our multimodal transportation network and need to 
be safe and reliable for everyday use. We will ensure that sidewalk repairs are 
more equitably distributed throughout the city.

Fairmount Indigo Line Service 
Improvements to Promote Equity
Develop  the  business  case  for  the  Massachusetts 
Bay  Transportation  Authority  (MBTA)  to  invest  in 
the Fairmount Indigo Line to meet the city’s grow-
ing transportation needs and address longstand-
ing  transportation 
inequities.  Imagine  Boston 
2030  identified  the  Fairmount/Indigo  Line  as  a 
key  corridor  for  expanding  access  to  opportuni-
ty  and  reducing  disparities  through  coordinated 
investments  in  transportation,  neighborhood  vi-
brancy, and education. Go Boston 2030 has simi-
larly prioritized improving Fairmount Line service. 
To  advance  these  key  goals,  the  City  will  partner 
with  the  MBTA  to  mobilize  investment  in  these 
much-needed 
improvements  while  ensuring 
affordability.  

ACTION
Climate Resilient Transportation 
Infrastructure
Ensure that key transportation networks can with-
stand  the  impacts  of  climate  change  while  pro-
moting  an  improved  quality  of  life.  Go  Boston 
2030 put forth an aspirational target that all trans-
portation  systems  will  remain  operational  during 
a flood or snow event, with sufficient alternatives 
provided  to  residents  in  the  event  of  disruptions. 
While  planning  for  necessary  climate  resilience 
upgrades to our transit infrastructure, we will lever-
age  all  opportunities  to  create  multiple  benefits.  
For  instance,  when  a  station  is  being  retrofitted 
for sea level rise, we can leverage that investment 
to  also  mitigate  heat  and  promote  equity.  The 
Fairmount/Indigo Line, already a strong candidate 
for investment, is ideally positioned to unlock resil-
ience value for Bostonians by ensuring that it is not 
just more accessible and better serviced but also 
resilient to climate change.  

ACTION
Sidewalk Maintenance Policy
Revamp Boston’s sidewalk policy to address sidewalk maintenance and repair by more proactively col-
lecting data on sidewalk conditions citywide. Currently, our sidewalk policy depends upon notifications 
from concerned residents to the City’s 311 service.15 Putting the onus on residents means that resources 
are likely to be unevenly distributed to neighborhoods with high 311 utilization. We will explore new 
methods  of  gathering  sidewalk  data—including  the  deployment  of  inspection  units—and  develop  a 
more systematic approach to evenly allocating scarce resources for sidewalk repairs.

Open  Space  Cabinet  will  work  to  integrate  les-
sons learned within Climate Ready Boston’s com-
munity  climate  planning  efforts,  including  those 
taking place at the district level. Armed with these 
findings,  we  will  be  able  to  provide  guidance  on 
replicating  these  community  engagement  and 
resilience-building efforts in other neighborhoods, 
while  recognizing  that  each  neighborhood  pres-
ents its own unique challenges.

Expand Distributed Energy to 
Vulnerable Communities

  WHAT    Develop action plans for Community Energy Solutions in areas with 
significant concentrations of critical facilities and vulnerable populations. We 
will implement resilient, low-carbon energy sources, including district energy, 
local energy generation, and microgrids, to provide critical alternative energy 
sources whenever Boston’s energy system is disrupted. 

  WHY    Energy  redundancy  helps  to  ensure  that  critical  facilities—such  as 
grocery stores, pharmacies, senior homes, and affordable housing develop-
ments—can remain operational during and after extreme weather events. This 
redundancy is especially critical for cooling homes in neighborhoods that are 
most susceptible to the urban heat island effect. Redundancy can also pro-
tect neighborhoods from the increasing threat of cyberattacks on the power 
grid.16 Finally, a clean energy microgrid provides environmental and econom-
ic benefits year-round by providing affordable energy that offsets the energy 
load from the main power grid, reducing day-to-day costs.

ACTION
Lower Roxbury Microgrid Pilot
Prioritize the development of a microgrid in Lower 
Roxbury. MORRE previously supported the Boston 
Community Energy Study’s identification of a pilot 
location  in  Lower  Roxbury  for  feasible  microgrid 
investment  based  on  the  presence  of  social  vul-
nerability,  high-energy-use  buildings,  affordable 
housing, and the co-location of critical facilities.17 A 
microgrid in Lower Roxbury could provide contin-
uous power to critical sites used by local residents 
and  provide  substantial  avoided  monetary  losses 
during neighborhood power outages. 

ACTION
Expand Microgrids 
Partner with communities to support the expan-
sion of microgrids into other vulnerable communi-
ties. By design, microgrid projects can help create 
local, high-paying jobs and provide cost reductions 
for  energy,  both  of  which  can  provide  significant 
benefits  to  vulnerable  populations  throughout 
Boston.18  We  will  explore  the  possibility  of  build-
ing  additional  microgrids  by  supporting  com-
munity  engagement  and  research  in  additional 
neighborhoods.

VISION 4: CONNECTED, ADAPTIVE CITYPROMISING PRACTICE 

The Guild
The Guild, founded in 2012, is a mission-driven social enterprise led by residents 
of color from Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, and beyond, intent on transforming 
their neighborhoods into living labs of innovative thinking, healing, asset creation, 
green  technology  demonstration,  resilience,  and  sustainable  economic  develop-
ment. The Guild seeks to develop and pilot sustainability solutions and initiatives 
that promote racial equity, health, beauty, and prosperity.

expanded its footprint to Four Corners, Mattapan, 
and  Roxbury  and  has  engaged  well  over  19,000 
community  residents.  By  summer  of  2017,  the 
Guild  will  have  under  its  stewardship  more  than 
200,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor neigh-
borhood venues.

The  amazing  work  of  the  Guild  reimagines  our 
urban environment and contributes to Boston’s re-
silience by developing new, self-sustaining models 
for  socially  and  environmentally  responsible  eco-
nomic development.

In  2012,  the  Guild  partnered  with  the  City  of 
Boston  across  multiple  departments  (DND,  ISD, 
ONS, Mayor’s Office, Parks and Rec, Public Works) 
to  design  and  pilot  a  temporary  licensing  ar-
rangement whereby community members could 
ensure, improve, and steward public land resourc-
es for community benefit. The Guild describes its 
approach  to  transforming  formerly  vacant  public 
land  as  “sustainable  metroscaping,”  or  an  adapt-
able, interim land-use model for building inner-city 
capacity,  environmental  health,  and  econom-
ic  opportunity  in  a  way  that  responds  directly  to 
community needs, interests, and untapped skills. 
Formerly vacant sites are now hubs of community 
events, gatherings, fitness, dance and music class-
es, urban agriculture, and a lending library. 

With  a  wide  array  of  community  residents  and 
partners,  the  Guild  has  launched  demonstration 
projects that shift local discourse toward commu-
nity governance of public resources, healthy-eating 
wisdom in communities of color, alternative uses 
of public streets, interfaith collaboration, and the 
support  and  engagement  of  local  entrepreneurs 
around community gaps and needs. The Guild ini-
tially  licensed  and  took  on  stewardship  of  more 
than 35,000 square feet and, within the first year, 
engaged over 3,500 residents. Today the Guild has

Adapt for Extreme Heat 

  WHAT    Conduct an analysis of extreme-heat threats that takes into account 
social vulnerability, and use this analysis to inform policy and investment de-
cisions that prioritize populations with the greatest need.

 RESILIENCE QUALITIES 

 Extreme heat is one of the most disproportionately harmful climate 
  WHY   
change–related threats for people of color, low-income communities, older 
adults,  people  with  medical  illnesses,  and  children.  Climate Ready Boston 
prioritized extreme temperatures as one of the major hazards Boston must 
address in order to adapt to climate change. The rate of increase in average 
temperatures is accelerating, meaning that Boston’s average summer tem-
peratures and number of days with extreme heat will continue to increase 
over  time.  Increased  instances  of  extreme  heat  are  expected  to  become 
more  commonplace  in  the  near  future  as  a  result  of  climate  change,  and 
this heat can be especially dangerous in neighborhoods with older buildings 
and  less  green  infrastructure,  leading  to  what  is  known  as  the  “urban  heat 
island effect.”

Boston’s Heat Emergency Action Plan
Prioritize  Roxbury  for  the  implementation  of  the 
City’s  Heat  Emergency  Action  Plan,  reducing 
community  members’  vulnerabilities  to  extreme 
heat  and  then  scaling  up  best  practices  city-
wide.  We  will  pilot  practices  that  include  lever-
aging  neighborhood-level  volunteers  to  check  in 
on neighbors during heat events and will partner 
with nonprofits and healthcare providers to regis-
ter disabled residents who lack cooling capacity in 
their homes.  

ACTION
Heat and Vulnerability Analysis
Use  a  resilience  and  racial  equity  lens  to  infuse 
social  vulnerability  into  neighborhood  heat  anal-
yses. We will build upon the ongoing work of the 
Trust for Public Land to map land surface tempera-
ture  and  identify  potential  high-priority  locations 
for green infrastructure. This analysis will help the 
City to determine the most effective strategies for 
protecting Bostonians from extreme heat.

ACTION
Heat Adaptation Projects
Recommend heat island reduction strategies that 
will benefit vulnerable populations. Strategies may 
include  deploying  home  cooling  equipment,  in-
centivizing cool roofs, expanding the tree canopy, 
and installing cool pavements.

 As projected in Climate Ready Boston, frequent stormwater flooding 
  WHY   
is expected to impact over 85,000 Bostonians as early as the 2070s, with every 
city neighborhood set to be exposed. The impacts of stormwater and river-
ine  flooding include road disruptions, damage to residential and commercial 
property, and decreased mobility. These impacts will increasingly affect resi-
dents throughout Boston, with disproportionately disruptive effects on social-
ly vulnerable populations.  

Coastal flooding, distinct from more regular stormwater flooding, is also par-
ticularly  dangerous  for  vulnerable  populations.  Projections  developed  for 
Climate Ready Boston indicate that there is a near-term risk to residents of 
East Boston, while a major coastal storm could also significantly impact areas 
of Roxbury and portions of Dorchester.  

Targeting neighborhoods with higher proportions of vulnerable populations 
for flood adaptation measures will protect livelihoods while improving every-
one’s quality of life.

the green infrastructure location plan called for in 
Climate Ready Boston that will help site and pri-
oritize green infrastructure such as bioswales, rain 
gardens,  permeable  pavement,  tree  plantings, 
and green/blue roofs—many of which also reduce 
the  impacts  of  extreme  heat.  Other  innovative 
green infrastructure interventions, including water 
squares, will also be explored, as they also promote 
equity and social cohesion and enhance livability 
in our neighborhoods.

greater risk of flooding from sea level rise. A major storm at 36 
inches of sea level rise impacts the vulnerable neighborhoods 
of East Boston, Dorchester, Roxbury, and the South End.

Empower Collaborative, Resilient 
Response to Disruptions

  WHAT    Build the capacity of communities, nonprofits, small businesses, and 
public health and healthcare infrastructure to prepare together for emergen-
cies and disruptions, leveraging existing strengths and expanding community 
relationships to partner with vulnerable populations.

  WHY    Closely  knit  communities  are  able  to  bounce  back  more  quickly 
during times of crisis. Social connections and infrastructure within and across 
communities are known to be one of the most critical factors that influences 
a community’s recovery after a disaster. Individual and community social net-
works can provide access to various resources in disaster situations, including 
information, aid, financial resources, and child care along with emotional and 
psychological support.24 However, socially vulnerable communities have been 
affected  differently  by  policies  and  practices  that  can  hinder  or  strength-
en  the  community’s  social  capital.  Building  stronger  connections  between 
communities and local small businesses will facilitate collaborative planning, 
strengthening community recovery in the wake of unexpected disruptions.

ACTION
Climate Risk Engagement Campaign
Engage  communities  and  businesses  to  spread 
awareness  of  climate-related  risks, 
including 
coastal  and  stormwater  flooding  and  extreme 
heat. A consortium of partners, including MORRE, 
Greenovate Boston, the Environment Department,

Public  Health  Commission,  and  others  will  build 
on  existing  neighborhood  preparedness  efforts 
and  collaborate  to  advance  an  education  cam-
paign, with a special focus on vulnerable popula-
tions, that explains climate risks to Bostonians to 
help them prepare for disruptive events.

ACTION
Neighborhood Response Plans
Connect  community  leaders,  public  health  and 
healthcare  infrastructure,  local  nonprofits,  and 
businesses to one another to collaboratively iden-
tify neighborhood resources for emergencies and 
develop community asset maps. We will leverage 
the  Boston  Main  Streets  network  of  commercial 
districts and Federal Small Business Administration 
resources to support small businesses throughout 
Boston in their efforts to develop continuity plans 
to  ensure  that  they  are  prepared  for  disasters. 
Additionally,  we  will  partner  with  public  health 
and  healthcare  infrastructure,  communities,  and 
businesses  to  determine  ways  to  strengthen  co-
ordination  within  neighborhoods  for  emergency 
planning, mitigation, response, and recovery.

Invest in Adaptation Projects

  WHAT    Leverage 100RC platform partners to develop innovative finance ap-
proaches  to  fund  resilience-building  efforts.  We  will  collaborate  on  key  ini-
tiatives around zoning changes and design guidelines to reflect adaptation 
measures and create co-benefits.

  WHY    While investing in resilience provides cost savings, yields multiple ben-
efits, and improves existing systems, resilience-focused projects are particu-
larly difficult to finance with traditional capital budgets or payback models. 
Current approaches for financing City government efforts, which rely on quan-
titative risk analyses, tend to focus on infrastructure and economic impacts 
at the expense of social impacts.25 The City will make investments to protect 
Boston  for  future  generations,  supported  by  the  infusion  of  forward-facing 
climate data into zoning and design processes.

PRIORITIZING INFRASTRUCTURE  
MAINTENANCE THROUGH AN EQUITY LENS

Our efforts to improve data transparency and collection can also be used as 
a means of addressing aging infrastructure. Strengthening our 311 data can 
help the City prioritize investments where they’re most needed.

ACTION
Cost of Inaction Analysis
Develop a study that quantifies the “cost of inac-
tion” on key assets and neighborhoods at risk from 
the impacts of climate change to emphasize the 
need  for  greater  investment  in  proactive  climate 
resilience measures.  

ACTION
Zoning and Designing for Resilience
Update  zoning  and  building  regulations  to  sup-
port climate-readiness investment in the built en-
vironment.  We  will  advance  strategies  proposed 
in Climate Ready Boston to promote widespread 
climate readiness: revised zoning codes to support 
climate-ready buildings, design guidelines, pursu-
ing state building code amendments, and the in-
corporation of climate projections into area plans. 

ACTION
Resilient Infrastructure Financing 
Develop  financing  strategies  for  district-scale  ad-
aptation  efforts  and  building  retrofits.  Potential 
strategies,  some  of  which  were  first  identified  in 
Climate Ready Boston,  include  leveraging  feder-
al  and  state  infrastructure  funds,  forming  special 
assessment  districts,  creating  resilience  business 
improvement  districts,  and  building  joint  capital 
planning structures to collect funds from adapta-
tion  project  beneficiaries.  We  will  ensure  that  in-
frastructure  financing  is  leveraged  to  benefit  vul-
nerable  communities  by  prioritizing  geographies 
based on projected risk of shocks and stresses and 
by embedding a resilience and racial equity lens in 
the budgets for those projects.

GLOSSARY 

RESILIENCE AND RACIAL 
EQUITY GLOSSARY

This glossary provides definitions for terms used consistently throughout Resilient 
Boston.  For  a  full  list  of  definitions  relevant  to  resilience  and  racial  equity,  visit 
www.boston.gov/resilience.

Color  blindness:  The  misguided  idea  that  every-
one and every racial group is now equal, and thus 
there is no need to promote racial equity. People 
who  believe  in  a  color-blind  society  state  that 
racial/ethnic discrimination, inequality, and racism 
no longer exist because an individual’s skin color 
(race) is or should be ignored.

Community  Trauma:  Community  trauma  is  the 
product of the cumulative and synergistic impact 
of regular incidents of interpersonal, historical, and 
intergenerational  violence  and  the  continual  ex-
posure to structural violence.

Cultural Competency: The awareness of one’s own 
cultural  identity  and  ability  to  understand  differ-
ence within and across cultures. This understand-
ing guides and supports the work of professionals 
in various environments.

Displacement:  The  immediate  result  of  gentrifi-
cation.  This  outcome  is  typically  involuntary  and 
occurs when residents can no longer afford to live 
in their neighborhoods/communities. 

Diversity: Having a high number of races, cultures, 
and ethnicities represented within a group, orga-
nization, or institution.

Equality: Aims to ensure that all individuals have 
what they need to reach their full potential; how-
ever,  it  does  not  consider  the  fact  that  everyone 
does not start from the same place and need the 
same things.

Equity: Respectful treatment and fair involvement 
of  all  people  in  a  society.  It  is  the  state  in  which 
everyone  has  the  opportunity  to  reach  their  full 
potential.  Additionally,  the  National  Academy  of 
Public  Administration,  which  has  been  studying 
the use of equity as a means of evaluating public 
policy describes equity as the “fair, just, and equi-
table  management  of  all  institutions  serving  the 
public  directly  or  by  contract;  the  fair,  just,  and 
equitable  distribution  of  public  services  and  im-
plementation  of  public  policy;  and  the  commit-
ment  to  promote  fairness,  justice,  and  equity  in 
the formation of public policy.” This definition lays 
the groundwork for measuring equity in Resilient 
Boston’s initiatives.

Ethnicity:  The  national  origin(s)  of  one’s  parents, 
grandparents, and other ancestors. People within 
an ethnic group typically share beliefs, language, 
culture, traditions, religion, etc.

Gentrification: The process of renovating a deteri-
orating neighborhood, resulting in higher property 
values, a change in the population, and culture in 
that particular area. This term is often used nega-
tively because of its common effects on commu-
nities of color.

Inclusion:  Involving  people  of  all  backgrounds, 
abilities, perspectives, and beliefs within a group, 
institution, or decision. This is more than achieving 
diversity;  it  is  ensuring  all  individuals  have  a  true 
sense of belonging.

136 

Resilient Boston

GLOSSARY 

Intersectionality: A theory that recognizes the in-
teraction of multiple forms of oppression (such as 
racism,  sexism,  classism,  heterosexism,  ableism, 
etc.)  and  its  consequences  on  an  individual  or 
group  of  individuals.  This  theory  helps  to  explain 
how people can be privileged in some areas and 
not privileged in others.

Justice: The  state  or  quality  of  being  fair,  equita-
ble, or moral. It exists when people are not treated 
unfairly on the basis of race, gender, sexuality, re-
ligion, political affiliations, age, belief, disability, lo-
cation, socioeconomic circumstances, or any other 
characteristic(s).

Oppression:  Unjust  use  of  power  and  authority 
that adversely impacts groups and individuals that 
lack power. Examples include racism, sexism, clas-
sism, homophobia, etc.

People of Color: A term that was created and used 
by people who do not identify (or European heri-
tage). This term has been used since the late 1970s. 
Important Note: Because every racial/ethnic group 
has its own experience and meaning, it is import-
ant  to  identify  people  through  their  own  racial/
ethnic group whenever possible.

Power:  The  ability  to  influence  and  make  deci-
sions.  Typically,  this  gives  an  individual  access  to 
resources  and  decision  makers  to  get  what  they 
want, even at the disadvantage of others.

Prejudice: A negative, preconceived opinion about 
an  individual  or  group  formed  without  actual 
knowledge or fair reason.

Privilege:  Unearned  and  often  unquestioned 
rights, immunities, or benefits enjoyed through as-
sociation and membership with a group.

Race:  An  unnatural  way  of  dividing  people  into 
separate groups based on characteristics such as 
physical looks, particularly skin color. This unnatu-
ral grouping is an example of a “social construct,” 
or a concept or category based on views and per-
sonal perceptions as opposed to scientific fact.

Racial  Discrimination:  The  (conscious  or  uncon-
scious) unfair treatment of others based on an in-
dividual’s (actual or perceived) race.

Racial  Healing:  A  process  that  corresponds  with 
justice.  It  is  the  intentional  effort(s)  to  repair  and 
restore the state of a marginalized group or indi-
viduals of that group to optimal health or sound-
ness.  This  process  should  follow  efforts  of  racial 
reconciliation.

Racial Inequity: Race-based differences in life out-
comes between groups or individuals. Racial ineq-
uities  are  due  to  unjust  institutional  policies  and 
practices and the uneven distribution of resources.1

Racial  Justice:  The  deliberate  creation  and  pro-
active  reinforcement  of  policies,  practices,  ideas, 
and  attitudes  that  result  in  equitable  treatment, 
access, opportunities, and outcomes for everyone.

Racism: A system of prejudice and discrimination 
based  on  how  one  looks  (“race”).  This  system  has 
historically  worked  in  favor  of  White  people  over 
people of color and continues to do so. Simply put, 
it is the result of prejudice plus power.

• 

• 

• 

 Institutional  Racism:  Policies  and  prac-
institutions  that  create  differ-
tices  within 
ent  outcomes 
for  different  racial  groups. 
These  policies  and  practices  may  never  men-
tion any racial group,  but their effect creates a 
disadvantage for  people of color.

 Internalized Racism: The acceptance of nega-
tive messages and treatment about one’s own 
race. This internal acceptance leads to patterns 
of thinking, feeling, and behaving that result in 
minimizing,  criticizing,  and/or  hating  oneself, 
while  valuing  the  White  people  as  the  domi-
nant racial group in the U.S.

 Interpersonal  Personally  Meditated  Racism: 
Prejudice  and  discriminatory  actions  and  be-
haviors  against 
individuals  or  groups.  This 
form  of  racism  can  either  be  intentional  or 
unintentional.

 

 

137

GLOSSARY 
GLOSSARY 

• 

 Systemic Racism: The combined result of pol-
icies and practices across institutions and soci-
ety that work to systematically privilege White 
people  and  disadvantage  people  of  color  over 
time. Also referred to as structural racism.

Resilience  and  Racial  Equity  Lens:  An  approach 
to looking at policies and programs to understand: 
how they may be able to maximize resilience in-
vestments; how they may be inadvertently increas-
ing racial inequities and social injustices; and how 
we can intentionally take action to address these 
challenges.

Social Cohesion: A community, neighborhood, or 
society  that  works  toward—and  ensures—the  full 
inclusion,  sense  of  belonging,  opportunity,  and 
well-being of all its members.

Social Justice: A vision of society in which the dis-
tribution  of  resources  is  equitable,  and  all  mem-
bers  are  physically  and  psychologically  safe  and 
secure.

Socioeconomic Class: The position of an individu-
al or group based on income, education, and job 
status. 

Sustainability: Consisting of reliable and effective 
structures and procedures to survive over time (in-
cluding leadership, capacity, and funding streams).

Resilient Boston would not be possible without the contributions of Boston resi-
dents and organizations. The collective insights, ideas, and energy across communi-
ties, nonprofits, businesses, and government informed the direction of this Strategy 
at every turn. We look forward to building long-lasting relationships and collectively 
advancing resilience and racial equity throughout Boston.
