Letter From Mayor Eric Garcetti 

My fellow Angelenos:

Recent catastrophes around the world—
hurricanes in the U.S. and the Caribbean, 
earthquakes in Mexico, fires in the western U.S., 
flooding in Nepal and Bangladesh—are serious 
reminders that every community needs focused 
resilience strategies. 

In Los Angeles, we know a major earthquake is 
a matter of when, not if. And we know that the 
next one could be more than 10 times worse 
than the 1994 Northridge earthquake that 
claimed 57 lives, injured over 9,000, displaced 
tens of thousands from their homes, and caused 
$20 billion in damage. 

And earthquakes aren’t the only threat we face: 
The effects of climate change are worsening, 
and cybercrime is causing more turmoil than 
ever for businesses, governments, and other 
institutions around the world. 

These threats are emerging quickly, and 
we can’t wait for catastrophes to hit before 
confronting them. We need a comprehensive, 
strategically coordinated approach to  
urban resilience. 

That’s what Resilient Los Angeles is about. 

It’s a plan that includes strategies to help us 
fortify our infrastructure, protect our economy, 
and make our city safer. But it’s also about 
strengthening the bonds of community in 
our neighborhoods and reinforcing universal 
values like inclusion and respect—because we 
can only overcome our greatest threats if we 
work together. 

Los Angeles is already leading on seismic 
safety with the Resilience by Design report 
developed by my office in 2014. And we’re 
taking aggressive steps to become a model for 
sustainability with my Sustainable City pLAn. 
Resilient Los Angeles builds on those ideas and 
brings them together into one plan that will 
guide us toward a more resilient future. 

The decisions we make today will shape the 
city that our children and grandchildren will 
live in tomorrow—and we have a responsibility 
to protect their future. This plan will help give 
us the insight and tools we need to build a 
more resilient Los Angeles, and I look forward 
to working with all of you to accomplish that 
critical goal.

Sincerely,

Eric Garcetti 
Mayor 

Letter From Los Angeles’  
First Chief Resilience Officer 
Angelenos have a long history overcoming the challenges 
they face and forging opportunity and inspiration from 
them. Resilient Los Angeles builds on this foundation by 
providing solutions to a city that has already accom-
plished a lot to create the conditions for developing 
meaning resilience.

Letter From 100 Resilient Cities
On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to 
congratulate Mayor Garcetti and the City of Los Angeles 
on the release of Resilient Los Angeles, a major mile-
stone for the City and for our partnership. This ambitious 
strategy cements Los Angeles’ status as a global leader 
and innovator and will lead to an even stronger and 
more dynamic city.

At its core, building resilience means strengthening our 
community fabric today so that we can survive, adapt, 
and thrive no matter what kind of crisis or catastrophe 
is in our future. It means thoughtfully examining how all 
of our systems, communities, and vulnerabilities intersect 
and affect one another. If left unaddressed, any one of 
these stresses will not only continue to negatively impact 
Angelenos’ daily lives, but also exacerbate disasters 
when they occur. We must do everything we can to keep 
Angelenos safe in their homes and neighborhoods— 
and in our city—during times of crisis.  

Resilient Los Angeles represents both a beginning and 
an end. It is the culmination of a months-long process to 
cultivate partnerships and develop actions that increase 
Los Angeles’ resilience. It is also the beginning of a 
greater citywide commitment to continue to collaborate, 
form new partnerships, and design new initiatives in a 
continuous process that will contribute to a safer and 
stronger Los Angeles. 

I want to thank the hundreds of partners that have 
participated in the development of Resilient Los Angeles. 
Experts from Los Angeles’ leading academic institutions; 
professional associations; City departments; and public, 
private, and nonprofit partners have shaped the next 
steps in resilience building. We invite every Angeleno to 
help make our City stronger, safer, and more inclusive.

Marissa Aho, AICP 
Chief Resilience Officer 

As a city of dramatic contrasts, Los Angeles spans a  
vast range of geographies, climates, conditions, and 
communities that pose disparate challenges and 
opportunities. Los Angeles’ complexity requires a 
nuanced but bold vision. Resilient Los Angeles has that 
vision, with a scope and scale that leverage the city’s 
strengths and systems to build a more resilient urban 
ecosystem. Even amid the many innovative strategies 
we have already seen across our network, this strategy 
stands apart. From planning for the individual, family, 
and business and property owner; to local community 
networks and neighborhoods; to citywide policies, 
services, and infrastructure; to partnerships in the region 
beyond—Resilient Los Angeles spans all of the city’s 
systems without losing sight of its constituent parts and 
the lives of individual Angelenos. While it empowers the 
individual, the community, the city, and the region, it 
also emphasizes that the effort is collective, the future 
dependent on each part of the greater whole. This is 
what meaningful resilience is about and the only way it 
can be built.

Los Angeles’ approach to building urban resilience within 
the city, throughout the state, and across the 100RC 
Network has made it a leader in our global movement. 
Also groundbreaking is the strategy’s ambitious 
commitment to innovation and leadership in the global 
resilience movement, with a chapter devoted to partner-
ships and technological innovation.

We are excited to continue the next stage of our 
partnership and to collaborate in the implementation of 
this groundbreaking strategy, which will help ensure a 
resilient future for Los Angeles and propel the resilience 
effort worldwide.

Michael Berkowitz, President 
100 Resilient Cities

SUMMARY

Los Angeles has always been a global destination for dreamers, 
doers, thinkers, and creators. We have blue skies and pristine 
beaches and a rich culture of diversity, creativity, and entrepre-
neurism. The opportunities of tomorrow are limitless, as we work  
to build Los Angeles into a vibrant, thriving model city of the  
21st century. 

Yet this dream comes with the growing pressures of our susceptibility 
to the impacts of climate change and aging infrastructure. We are  
all deeply aware that it is a question of when, not if Los Angeles will 
face the next Big One—whether it’s an earthquake, flood,  
heatwave, fire, or other disaster with long-term impacts. While we  
have made great strides over the past 25 years, it’s time to do 
more—to strengthen and create new partnerships, to change the  
way our government collaborates and to empower and secure our  
communities—so that we can work together to make L.A. a global 
model of resilience.

Building a more resilient Los Angeles starts with addressing the 
needs of our most vulnerable populations and neighborhoods.  
Too often, those who are least equipped to handle the effects of 
catastrophic events end up suffering the most. And empowering our 
most vulnerable—children, immigrants, and lower-income residents, 
among others—is not just about emergency preparedness. It is about 
directly addressing those underlying daily stresses—such as poverty, 
financial security, and affordable housing—and ensuring that all 
Angelenos feel safe and secure in their daily lives. It also means 
bringing neighbors together to strengthen our collective resources 
and social bonds and innovating creative solutions along the way.

Let’s act today so we are all stronger and safer together tomorrow. Resilient 
Los Angeles lays the groundwork for our collective action, involving 
everyone from the individual family to our regional partners. This plan will 
help us protect ourselves against sudden and unexpected events—from 
earthquakes to flooding—and address our underlying chronic stresses, 
such as economic security, climate change, and aging infrastructure. Not 
only does Resilient Los Angeles give a voice to the hundreds of diverse 
stakeholders engaged in defining our resilience goals over the past two 
years, it provides a roadmap to achieving them. And we will hold ourselves 
accountable by measuring progress toward these goals for years to come.

Our proposed actions are about building resilience to 
both the impacts of unexpected catastrophic events 
and chronic underlying stresses. Extensive outreach 
during the resilience strategy planning process 
resulted in five consistent themes around what 
resilience in Los Angeles means to our city—resulting 
in a series of goals and actions that provide a unified 
call to action that is inclusive, collaborative,  
and ensures that we are all working together to 
achieve our city’s resilience.

Every Angeleno plays a role in building our resilience. 
Together, we can make Los Angeles a place where 
people can continue to follow their dreams for 
generations to come.

opportunities related to Resilient Los Angeles:  
lamayor.org/resilience

 
The 96 actions of Resilient Los Angeles  
will improve outcomes around:

•  Leadership and Engagement

•  Disaster Preparedness and Recovery

•  Economic Security

•  Climate Adaptation

•  Infrastructure Modernization

Los Angeles was selected as an inaugural member 
of the 100 Resilient Cities Network in 2013. This global 
network, pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, 
helps member cities around the world become 
more resilient to the physical, social, and economic 
challenges of the 21st century. Through the program, 
Los Angeles hired its first Chief Resilience Officer, 
Marissa Aho, who has spearheaded a collaborative 
effort among hundreds of stakeholders across City 
departments, community organizations, and partners 
in the nonprofit, academic, and philanthropic sectors. 
The outcome of these interdisciplinary conversations 
and research are commitments to a set of actions and 
to creating and expanding innovative partnerships 
that discard the silos in which we traditionally work.

Every Angeleno plays a role in strengthening L.A.’s 
resilience: Each one of us can improve our city’s 
ability to withstand and recover from the impacts of 
an unexpected shock. And this role stretches from an 
individual person or family and the choices we make 
to how our region’s jurisdictions work together to 
achieve common goals.

Our impact has a global reach that extends well 
beyond City limits: As one of the nation’s largest cities 
and part of a global network, we have a unique 
opportunity to lead by example and set the standard 
for effective citywide resilience.

To that end, Resilient Los Angeles is organized around 
key themes at different scales of impact. Often, size 
and scale can lead to efforts in isolation; a city cannot 
effectively plan a disaster recovery program, for 
example, without leveraging the important work of 
local community partners. By creating a pathway that 
recognizes roles across various scales of governance, 
planning, and action, we ensure our collective work  
is connected—providing opportunities for information 
sharing and collaboration.

Resilient Los Angeles actions are organized  
around the following chapters:
Safe and Thriving Angelenos

Prepared and Responsive City

We’re building the capacity of individual families and 
businesses—both to prepare for and to recover from 
emergency events, and to build long-term financial 
security. We’re also seeking to cultivate and grow 
L.A.’s future leadership by partnering with young 
Angelenos to advance equity and stewardship in  
our communities.

Strong and Connected Neighborhoods

When disaster strikes, we know that recovery starts in 
our local communities and networks—and we need 
to further empower and engage our neighborhood 
organizations to foster local resilience and social 
cohesion. These local networks play a critical role in 
climate adaptation for our most vulnerable commu-
nities. We’re also taking action to reduce local health 
and wellness disparities while increasing economic 
security for all Angelenos.  

We are setting measurable goals to build our 
city’s leadership in resilience, integrating tools and 
technology to prioritize our most vulnerable in 
decision-making, and fostering faster and more 
efficient disaster preparedness and recovery. We’re 
also modernizing our city’s aging infrastructure for 
the future and developing ways to provide more safe 
and affordable housing to improve economic security 
of Angelenos.

Pioneering and Collaborative Partner

Our work doesn’t stop at our city’s borders. We 
recognize the role we play globally as part of the  
100 Resilient Cities network and the leadership we can 
provide to our region and beyond. We will continue to 
uphold principles of climate resilience  
as a city and will engage our public, private, and 
philanthropic leadership to be a model through 
advocacy, infrastructure investment, and partnerships.

Resilient Los AngelesResilient Los AngelesIntroductionIntroductionCITY OF
LOS ANGELES

RESILIENT  
LOS ANGELES

Los Angeles is a destination for people 
from around the world to pursue 
their dreams. More than four million 
Angelenos blend cultures, beliefs, 
traditions, languages, and cuisine into a 
beautiful mosaic. We value opportunity, 
imagination, and diversity. Angelenos are 
entrepreneurs, creators, and innovators 
whose spirit has made Los Angeles into a 
world-class cultural and economic hub.  

To realize a resilient Los Angeles, we 
must invest in strategies and actions that 
address our greatest risks and protect 
our most vulnerable people, places, 
and systems. This strategy focuses on 
five primary themes: 1) Leadership and 
Engagement; 2) Disaster Preparedness 
and Recovery; 3) Economic Security;  
4) Climate Adaptation; and 5) 
Infrastructure Modernization. 

These are not challenges with simple 
fixes—but it is possible to reduce risks and 
vulnerabilities by leveraging each invest-
ment we make in our people, places, and 
systems to address these challenges and 
advance our resilience goals.  

Building the City’s resilience will require 
every Angeleno to play a role through 
individual participation and collective 
action. While the future seems increasingly 
unpredictable, we do know many of our 
risks and many of the remedies that we 
can use to address them.

As we work together to create a safer 
and stronger Los Angeles, we need to 
strengthen our community fabric by stitch-
ing together resources, partnerships, and 
creative solutions for prioritizing our most 
vulnerable people, places, and systems.  

Resilient Los Angeles seeks to move 
forward this dialogue and invites all 
Angelenos and potential partners to join 
in the discussion and to work together 
to build a city that is safe, livable, and 
prosperous for all Angelenos.  

Over the past 25 years, Los Angeles has 
become a safer and more sustainable 
city. When faced with challenges, we 
have collaborated to reduce crime and 
to invest in new public transit, cleaner 
air, and greener technology. We have 
strengthened and grown our cultural 
institutions, built new schools and parks, 
and witnessed the revitalization of our 
downtown. We have made commitments 
to build more affordable housing, increase 
the minimum wage, double our transit 
network, improve air quality, and revitalize 
our river. 

Resilient Los Angeles is a commitment to a 
thriving future for all Angelenos. Resilience 
is the capacity to survive, adapt, and 
grow—regardless of adversity and 
setbacks. Recent events have brought the 
challenges that cities around the globe 
face to the forefront—from earthquakes 
and fires to record-breaking storms and 
heat waves and from a growing homeless-
ness crisis to aging infrastructure. And we 
know that our most vulnerable people and 
places are disproportionately impacted 
by these challenges.

A resilient Los Angeles is a city that is 
safe, livable, and prosperous no matter 
the stresses and shocks. The stronger our 
foundation is today, the more prepared 
and connected we are to withstand a 
major event and to emerge even stronger.  
And, as many Angelenos know, it is a 
matter of when, and not if, a catastrophic 
event will occur.

LOS ANGELES’ 
RESILIENT 
HISTORY

We can learn a lot about our city’s approach to building urban 
resilience from previous events in our history. Los Angeles’ landscape 
has been shaped by challenges we have faced in the past, and some 
challenges keep repeating themselves. During the Great Depression, 
a number of events shaped the future of Los Angeles, from the 
channelization of the Los Angeles River to the establishment of the 
Field Act, which increased seismic safety for public school buildings 
after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. Following World War II, the 
auto-oriented development of Southern California’s neighborhoods 
and discriminatory housing policies and lending practices contributed 
to neighborhood disparities in wealth and opportunity—the effects of 
which we still see today. 

In the early 1990s, Los Angeles experienced peak crime rates, civil  
unrest, and a damaging earthquake, all within a few years. Approx-
imately 42% of Angelenos have been born or migrated to Los Angeles 
since the early ‘90s and did not experience these events in our history. 
It is important for everyone to know how our history has shaped 
the City of Los Angeles and how we view challenges and solutions 
surrounding resilience efforts today. Events in recent years have 
illustrated the city’s vulnerabilities and revealed the day-to-day chal-
lenges that affect our ability to be safer, stronger, and more inclusive.

Resilient Los AngelesLearning from History: A Century of Shocks and Stresses

1943  
Zoot Suit Riots  
For 10 days, 200 sailors 
stationed in Chavez 
Ravine are joined by 
civilians and authorities in 
racially motivated rioting 
through Downtown and 
East Los Angeles, origi-
nally targeting Mexican 
American youths wearing 
popular “zoot suits” but 
also attacking African 
Americans and Filipino 
Americans.14

1943–1980s 
Smog and Ozone 
Depletion   
Southern California 
experiences decades 
of smog attacks, usually 
coupled with heat waves. 
The poor air quality and 
ozone depletion leads 
to the establishment of 
a number of air quality 
organizations, monitoring 
technology, and laws to 
reduce pollution sources.  

1933
Long Beach Earthquake  
An estimated magnitude 
6.3 earthquake hits Los 
Angeles, killing 120 people 
and destroying hundreds 
of buildings throughout 
the region.11

1933
Griffith Park Fire  
A fire sparked by a small 
pile of debris breaks out 
in Griffith Park, burning 47 
acres of land, killing 29 
people, and injuring over 
150 people.12

1938
Los Angeles Flood  

The Los Angeles, Santa 
Ana, and San Gabriel 
rivers flood, killing 115 
people. The floodwaters 
wash away banks, roads, 
bridges, and buildings, 
causing $70 million in 
damages.13

Herman J. Schultheis Collection / 
Los Angeles Public Library 

1945–1973    
Postwar Housing 
Development 
After World War II, the 
compounding effects of 
returning veterans starting 
families, federally backed 
mortgages under the G.I. 
bill, record automobile 
ownership, and the prolif-
eration of mass-produced 
tract homes created much 
of L.A.’s infamous sprawl. 
Racially discriminatory 
policies, such as redlining 
and racial covenants, 
excluded non-whites from 
many of these homes and 
contributed to economi-
cally and racially segre-
gated neighborhoods. 
This large portion of Los 
Angeles’ housing stock is 
now nearing the end of 
its design life and can not 
accommodate the City’s 
affordable housing needs.  
  

1965 
Watts Riots  
On August 11, 1965, a 
police confrontation in 
Watts sparks six days 
of civil unrest. Seen as 
an “uprising against an 
oppressive system,” over 
30,000 people participate 
in the riots, causing 3,438 
arrests, 1,032 injuries, 34 
deaths, and $40 million 
in damage to over 1,000 
buildings.

The Great Depression   
The Great Depression, 
caused by the stock 
market crash of 1929,   
lasts 10 years. This 
economic downfall has 
an indelibe effect on 
California, leading to a 
large influx of Dust Bowl 
migrants, a rise in unem-
ployment and a period of 
bank instability.

LOS ANGELES RESILIENCE EFFORTS
Several major planning efforts are currently contributing to the city’s 
resilience by creating a safer, healthier, and more equitable Los 
Angeles. Resilient Los Angeles integrates and leverages these efforts 
by highlighting existing complementary actions, expanding initiatives 
to include a resilience lens, and identifying new opportunities to 
protect people and safeguard the environment.

Making Critical Investments in  
Los Angeles’ Future  
In 2016 and 2017, Los Angeles voters 
passed three critical measures and one 
proposition that will transform the region.

MEASURE M: Voters passed $120 billion 
in funding for the expansion of transit lines 
and other transportation improvements, 
including first-mile/last-mile improvements.

MEASURE H/PROPOSITION HHH:  
Voters overwhelmingly passed two home-
lessness initiatives to help combat the 
crisis: Measure H will pay for services that

are expected to help lift 45,000 people 
out of homelessness, and Proposition HHH 
will help build an estimated 10,000 units of 
permanent supportive housing over the 
next decade.

MEASURE A: Voters approved $94.5 
million in annual property tax (without an 
end date) to create and maintain parks, 
open space, and natural water resources. 
The tax also addresses disparities in 
access to parks and open space.

The Power of Partnerships
Building resilience is fundamentally about creating 
and expanding partnerships. Everyone has a role 
to play in making Angelenos and our city safer and 
stronger. Resilient Los Angeles is the result of hundreds 
of existing and emerging partnerships. At every scale, 
Angelenos at are contributing to the city’s overall resil-
ience every day. We challenge every resilience-builder 
to identify new potential partners that may be missing 
from today’s discussions, plans, and projects and invite 
these future partners to join you. 

Everyone has a role to play in 
making Angelenos and our city 
safer and stronger.

We also recognize that the release of Resilient  
Los Angeles marks the next step and an important 
milestone in the city’s effort toward resilience. Resilient  
Los Angeles describes numerous opportunities for 
new and expanded collaborations among the  
private, public, nonprofit, and academic sectors to 
create a significant impact in building resilience.  
It will take persistence and an ongoing commitment 
from Angelenos and partner organizations to 
continue the work and to identify new potential 
challenges, opportunities, and partnerships. We 
invite you to join us in future discussions, plans, and 
projects. Because we cannot predict exactly what 
challenges the future will bring, we all must commit to 
continued engagement and collaboration.

Developing a Resilient  
Los Angeles 
Los Angeles was selected as an inaugural member 
of the 100 Resilient Cities Network in 2013. Since then, 
Angelenos have come together to develop Resilient 
Los Angeles, a strategy by and for Angelenos that 
leverages the city’s strengths and advances new part-
nerships to prepare Los Angeles to address current 
and future challenges.

To create this document, the City conducted in-depth 
research and analysis on the challenges we face 
as a city and incorporated input from community 
members, City staff, and subject-matter experts.  
Chief Resilience Officer Marissa Aho spearheaded  
a collaborative effort to engage stakeholders  
across City departments, community organizations, 
and partners in the nonprofit, academic, and  
philanthropic sectors. 

Aho and her team reached out to Angelenos through 
various surveys, meetings with key advisory groups 
comprising City staff, discussions with external focus 
groups, and one-on-one meetings with community 
members. The team evaluated shocks and stresses 
facing Los Angeles, analyzed perceptions of 
resilience, and identified the best practices to combat 
potential challenges. In all, hundreds of stakeholders 
across the city contributed to this process.
The team evaluated shocks and 
stresses facing Los Angeles,  
analyzed perceptions of resilience, 
and identified the best practices to 
combat potential challenges.

Drawing on this research, the City identified priority 
areas to target resilience-building efforts. Working 
groups including City staff, academics, community 
organizations, and other experts met regularly to 
identify promising solutions and refine existing courses 
of action in Resilient Los Angeles. The team also 
held several workshops with stakeholders to discuss 
innovative, community-driven approaches to build 
resilience, addressing topics such as Los Angeles River 
Resilience and Neighborhood Resilience Hubs. The 
recommendations developed through this process 
have been incorporated into Resilient Los Angeles.

Resilient Los AngelesResilient Los AngelesIntroductionIntroductionINTRODUCING SHOCKS  
AND STRESSES
The context of Los Angeles results in unique risks and vulnerabilities 
that impact the city’s ability to sustain and strengthen its resilience.  
In resilience terms, shocks are sudden or acute events that threaten 
or impact Los Angeles’ immediate well-being. These can include 
earthquakes, extreme weather events, infrastructure failures, or civil 
unrest. Stresses are daily or chronic challenges that weaken our 
natural, built, or human resources. Examples include climate change, 
aging infrastructure, inequity, and homelessness. Stresses can  
amplify the effects of shocks when they occur, particularly for 
vulnerable populations. 

The shocks and stresses shown on this page are featured throughout 
Resilient Los Angeles. Look for the icons identifying the vulnerabilities 
to which Angelenos and our city are most susceptible.

Shock

Stress

Disaster Preparedness and Recovery
Multiple hazards and threats could affect Los Angeles with little to no notice, and these 
disruptions could impact a few or all Angelenos. However, the magnitude of the impact 
can be reduced through greater awareness of these potential disasters and preparedness 
measures that can be taken in advance to bounce back quickly when disaster strikes. 

  Earthquake

  Fire

  Landslides

  Riot/Civil Unrest

  Public Health Emergencies

  Chemical Emergencies

  Cybercrime and Terrorism

  Tsunami

Economic Security
Inequities in access and opportunities, both generationally and suddenly, strain the  
community fabric on a daily basis—worsening disparities and impacting Angelenos’  
health, wealth, and quality of life. Understanding and reducing daily stresses will increase 
the capacity of Angelenos to withstand additional challenges.

Climate Adaptation
Los Angeles is taking action to reduce the impact of future climate change, while also  
preparing for and adapting to the already-changing environment. Over the past few 
years, Los Angeles has experienced a new normal, with record-breaking drought, heat, 
and storms; climate projections illustrate the future challenges with urban heat island, 
unpredictable snowpack, and sea level rise.

Resilient Los Angeles includes four chapters,  
15 goals, and 96 actions for Angelenos, neighbor-
hoods, the City, and our partners to implement. 
Approximately one-third of the actions are steps 
that are currently underway, another third are 
actions that build on existing efforts using a 
resilience lens, and the final third are new actions 
that address gaps and further resilience- 
building in Los Angeles. 

The 96 actions within Resilient Los Angeles follow  
a consistent format and are organized by scale and 
goal. Each action has a title and description and 
identifies associated shocks, stresses, timeframe, 
and partners. At the end of Resilient Los Angeles, 
all of the actions are listed in the order they appear 
and by theme. 

Action Description 
Each description presents specific 
policies or programs the City and 
its partners will deploy to help 
achieve resilience goals, as well 
as important context that explains 
why the Action is needed.

Resilience Value 
Action descriptions highlight the resilience value of each action, explaining how 
the action will make L.A. stronger and better able to withstand multiple shocks 
and stresses. By aiming to maximize resilience value, policies and programs 
throughout this report consider the impact of multiple shocks and stresses in 
order to approach risks in an integrated way. This approach can save money 
and help promote a safe and thriving city. 

90

In partnership with the USGS, the City is 
developing a ShakeAlert portal, a tech-
nology developer program, and pilot pro-
grams that will integrate earthquake early 
warning technology into City systems. 

This will allow the City to communicate 
quickly and directly to Angelenos through 
smartphones, desktops, and notiﬁ cation 
systems such as public address systems. 
Los Angeles has the highest concentration 

of earthquake early warning sensors in the 
country, making the City an ideal site for 
pilot programs and attracting state and 
federal partners that continue to invest in 
the West Coast system as a whole.

A resilient 
Angeleno is 
capable of 
withstanding  
a crisis. 

WHAT’S YOUR ROLE? 

A resilient city begins with you. Each Angeleno has skills, talents, and 
passions that contribute to our thriving community. These skills are 
needed to prepare and plan for “blue-sky days” just as much as they 
are needed to respond and recover quickly when faced with a disrup-
tion or crisis. As we collectively work toward achieving a more resilient  
Los Angeles, we can all take action to strengthen our personal 
resilience and the resilience of those around us. Much like an oxygen 
mask on an airplane, the first step toward a more resilient city is 
increasing your own resilience so that you are better able to help 
others who may need your assistance.

Angelenos will face future challenges both known and new as we 
contend with a changing climate and the knowledge that it’s not  
a matter of if but when a large earthquake will hit our region.  
By continuing to build resilience in our families and friends,  
our businesses, and our youth, Angelenos are strengthening the 
foundation of our city as a whole.

Simple actions we take now will increase our safety and security today 
while preparing us for the challenges of tomorrow. Angelenos will 
build personal resilience by staying healthy, connected, and financially 
secure and by investing in sustainable and resilient measures to 
make our homes and our workplaces stronger and safer. We will build 
community resilience by working with businesses and community 
organizations to provide critical services. We will strengthen our 
supply chains and train employees to be safe and prepared.  
We will build a more resilient future by teaching young people about 
local risks and vulnerabilities and empowering them to be innovative 
problem-solvers who will continue to tackle these challenges.

LAUNCH A COORDINATED PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN 
THAT ENCOURAGES ANGELENOS TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT 
IMPROVE THEIR RESILIENCE

Consistent public education messaging and resources—coordinated by City departments, regional  
emergency management agencies, and preparedness organizations—will teach Angelenos how to  
protect themselves and their communities in advance of a crisis.

City departments, regional agencies, 
and nonprofit organizations provide 
emergency preparedness guidance to 
the public, such as direction to keep 
emergency supplies in their homes, 
businesses, and cars. This guidance is 
critical to helping Angelenos understand 

actions they can take to be self-sufficient 
when critical services are disrupted 
after a hazardous event or disaster. 
Efforts will centralize and streamline 
existing preparedness campaigns and 
communications to reach more Angelenos 
with the most-up-to-date and consistent 

information on risks, vulnerabilities, 
and emergency preparations. New 
technologies, including an earthquake 
early warning system, will be integral 
components of the coordinated outreach 
and education campaign.

  RESOURCES AND INCENTIVES TO BUILD RESILIENCE  

The City and its partners currently provide resources and incentives that promote sustainable water and 
energy usage and reduce disaster risks. The resources and incentives include education, training, rebates, 
and giveaways.

SEISMIC SAFETY THROUGH 
BRACE + BOLT GRANT PROGRAM

The State of California’s Brace + Bolt grant 
program recently expanded to include 
additional ZIP codes in the Los Angeles 
area. These $3,000 grants help to offset 
the costs of seismic retrofitting, including 
structural reinforcements like bracing and 
bolting that make buildings safer in the 
event of an earthquake. 

REDUCE WATER AND ENERGY 
USE THROUGH LADWP 
INCENTIVES

Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power (LADWP) programs offer incentives 
to make homes and businesses more 
energy and water efficient. These actions 
achieve sustainable and resilient outcomes 
by conserving resources and reducing 
energy and water demand when LADWP 
resources may be constrained. Methods 
and available incentives for conserving 
and reusing water in homes and businesses 
include sustainable gardening techniques 

for native and drought-tolerant species, 
efficient irrigation, rainwater capture and 
reuse, and local water efficiency ordi-
nances. Los Angeles currently offers energy 
efficiency and solar incentives to help 
Angelenos reduce bills and save energy 
and is considering additional incentives 
to drive down the cost of installing new 
technology, such as energy storage.

CULTIVATE THE CITY’S URBAN 
FOREST THROUGH CITY PLANTS

Angelenos are essential partners in 
growing and maintaining a healthy 
urban forest. To help establish and 
maintain healthy trees, the City partners 
with external organizations to educate 
residents and property owners about the 
health and economic benefits of trees. 
These organizations offer resources to 
assist with tree species selection, tree 
planting, maintenance, and appropriate 
water use. Education efforts highlight 
available City resources such as free 
shade trees offered through City Plants, 
which both plants and gives away over 
15,000 trees per year.

REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK 
THROUGH BRUSH CLEARANCE 

The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) 
works year-round with Angelenos to 
ensure hillside vegetation within 200 feet 
of any structure/building located within 
the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone 
is cleared. Brush clearance requirements 
and the inspection process for properties 
within this zone are provided by LAFD at 
local fire stations and online. 

ADVANCE EARTHQUAKE 
INSURANCE COVERAGE 
OPPORTUNITIES

The City will work with local, state, and 
federal partners to increase the number 
of properties covered by earthquake 
insurance. The City will use insurance 
coverage data to identify neighborhoods 
with coverage levels that are less than the 
average for California and target pilot 
programs and educational resources in 
these neighborhoods.

  LOW PARTICIPATION IN EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE
Currently, only about 10% of California 
residents have earthquake insurance. 
Coverage in the Los Angeles area is 
slightly higher, at approximately 16%.20  
By comparison, the New Zealand 
earthquake insurance market has 
approximately 95% participation, which 
proved fundamental to the ongoing 
recovery efforts in the city of Christchurch 
after it experienced a devastating 
magnitude 6.3 earthquake in 2011.21  
This event highlighted the gap between 
actual and perceived coverage in New 
Zealand, even with 95% participation.  

The 1994 Northridge earthquake dramati-
cally affected California’s earthquake insur-
ance market. By January 1995, 93% of the 
California homeowners insurance market 
had canceled or restricted earthquake 
insurance policies for homeowners.19 In 
response, the California Legislature formed 
the California Earthquake Authority in 1996, 
a consortium of 21 insurance companies 
that provide homeowner, condominium, 
mobile home, and renters insurance for 
earthquakes. In recent years, changes 
to earthquake insurance coverage have 
aimed to increase choices and participa-
tion, but earthquake insurance is perceived 
as expensive and participation remains 
low, indicating that there is still a long way 
to go in closing the coverage gap.

EXPAND WORKFORCE PREPAREDNESS TRAINING 
OPPORTUNITIES AND PROGRAMS TO QUICKLY RESTORE 
ESSENTIAL CITY SERVICES AFTER A MAJOR SHOCK 

3

INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ANGELENOS WITH 
PREPAREDNESS RESOURCES AND TRAINING IN OUR  
MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES 

A prepared and well-trained City workforce will be taught to incorporate resilience thinking into  
ongoing work to be better prepared to serve as Disaster Service Workers assisting Angelenos  
during interruptions, disasters, and crisises.

Expanded use of citywide technologies and tools, such as NotifyLA and CERT training, will help prepare 
more Angelenos to plan for and respond to an emergency and, in turn, also support fellow Angelenos and 
first responders.

With more than 45,000 employees, the 
City of Los Angeles is the third largest 
employer in Los Angeles County. In times 
of disaster, City employees are deployed 
as Disaster Service Workers (DSW), yet 
40% of City employees are of retirement 
age and many live outside of the city or 
county. Compounding these issues, many 
City staff may not have received recent 
disaster preparedness training, and some 
may need to attend to their own families 
or damaged properties. In advance of 
a major disaster, it is essential to assess 
the risks and vulnerabilities that will likely 
impact this workforce’s ability to support 
critical operations and recovery efforts. 

To do so, the City will review existing 
practices, protocols, and lessons learned 

from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. 
The City will also update and expand 
the existing DSW program to include 
City partners, contractors, and vendors 
where feasible. Ultimately, the efficacy and 
resilience of DSW relies on attention paid 
to changes in the City workforce, ensuring 
adequate participation and education 
levels to meaningfully support recovery 
efforts following a disaster.  

Transferring Institutional Knowledge  
Like many organizations, the City of Los 
Angeles is predicted to experience a 
dramatic shift in its workforce as baby 
boomers continue to retire. A resilient and 
informed workforce understands a variety 
of City functions and is able to carry on 

when employees retire or are unable to 
work in an emergency. The City is currently 
updating recruiting policies and programs 
to respond to this workforce shift, which will 
help attract and train new employees. For 
instance, in 2013, LADWP started the New 
Engineering Associate Training (NEAT)— 
a one-year, on-the-job training program in 
which new engineering associates learned 
about all major areas of the power system 
and received training in design, operations, 
and construction topics. Comprehensive 
training programs like NEAT pass on insti-
tutional knowledge and expose employees 
to the breadth of system functions. This 
transfer of institutional knowledge is essen-
tial for good day-to-day working practices, 
but becomes invaluable in a crisis.

Connect more people to the NotifyLA  
alert system to receive emergency 
communications   
The Emergency Management Department 
(EMD) will expand participation in the 
NotifyLA system through creative market-
ing, additional training, and supportive 
technical assistance opportunities that 
encourage more Angelenos to register 
their cell phones. The existing NotifyLA 
system is not automatic and requires 

proactive participation by Angelenos. 
Partnerships led by EMD will increase the 
functionality of the service and allow the 
City to provide information and directions 
to assist more Angelenos during emer-
gencies. For example, the technology 
can send evacuation orders to specific 
neighborhoods in the event of a wildfire or 
flood, or transmit a mass alert instructing 
residents to purify water after a major 
earthquake. These kinds of notifications

will help protect Angelenos when other 
communication tools may be unavailable.

Expand Angelenos’ ability to support  
first responders through technology  
and training 
The City will collaborate with software 
developers, designers, and others to 
develop technologies such as smartphone 
apps, websites, and software that use the 
wealth of existing City data and mapping 
tools to support first responders.

  PULSEPOINT TECHNOLOGY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS 

The LAFD has partnered with the 
PulsePoint Foundation and the Wireless 
Foundation to develop a life-saving 
emergency response smartphone app 
for Los Angeles. PulsePoint increases 
citizen awareness of cardiac events and 
recruits qualified Angelenos for potentially 
life-saving CPR. Targeted toward off-duty 
professionals and citizens trained in CPR, 
the PulsePoint app alerts users when a 
sudden cardiac arrest occurs in a nearby 
public place, directs them to the patient 
location, and provides CPR guidance 
while LAFD paramedic units are en route. 
This technology, paired with expanded 
CPR training for Angelenos, is one 
example of how Angelenos can support 
first responders with new technology and 
expanded training.

Outreach efforts will focus on expanding 
participation in neighborhoods with 
historically fewer trainings and resources. 
Partnerships with community groups and 
City departments will also increase access 
to training for teens. Teen CERT educates 
students about disaster preparedness 
for hazards that may impact their 
neighborhoods and trains them in basic 
disaster response skills. In turn, Teen CERT 
members are prepared to help themselves, 
their families, and their schools during 
a major disaster and when professional 
responders are delayed or not readily 
available. Teen CERT empowers students 
with decision-making and problem-solving 
skills and strategies to help make informed 
decisions regarding prevention-mitigation, 
preparedness, response, and recovery 
actions to reduce loss of life and property.

  EXPAND THE 

  

NUMBER OF ANGELENOS 
WITH CERT TRAINING

Through public-private partnerships, 
pilots, and expanded training oppor-
tunities, the City will collaborate to 
make Community Emergency Response 
Team (CERT) training accessible to 
more Angelenos. By training to be CERT 
members, Angelenos can expand their 
own capacity to respond to an emer-
gency. In 31 years, the LAFD has trained 
more than 70,000 Angelenos to be CERT 
members through instruction on basic 
first aid, evacuation tactics, and how to 
suppress small fires. Additionally, CERT 
members are trained in collaboration with 
City agencies to support neighborhood 
evacuations, search tactics, and communi-
cation skills such as the use of radios.

THE ORIGINS OF CERT 

The CERT program originated in Los 
Angeles over a quarter century ago 
and has since become a national 
model. The program originated in 1985 
when a group of LAFD officials traveled 
to Japan to learn how the Japanese 
responded to disastrous earthquakes. 
The deadly Kyoto earthquake struck 
during their visit, and LAFD officials 
discovered firsthand that community 
members play a significant role in 
post-disaster support and response. 
Later that year, during a separate trip to 
Mexico in the wake of the 8.1-magnitude 

Mexico City earthquake that killed 
more than 10,000 people, LAFD officials 
observed that untrained civilians 
became first responders when the 
quake struck, often digging with their 
bare hands to help free trapped victims. 
The following year, the LAFD created 
a pilot program to teach a core group 
of community members about basic 
fire suppression, first aid, search, and 
evacuation techniques. In 1993, CERT 
became part of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) offerings 
to communities nationwide.22

  

  

  

  

SOUTH LOS ANGELES TEEN 
CERT COLLABORATIVE 

The South Los Angeles Teen CERT 
Collaborative has trained 500 youth 
volunteers in five years and has 
established a best-practice program 
that has been honored by the Obama 
administration. This program, which 
teaches the Five Cs—Commitment, 
Community, Collaboration, CPR, 
and CERT—is a best practice in 
integrating youth development and 
resilience-building.

TEACH ANGELENOS HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES  
FROM CYBERATTACKS

Partner with local, state, and federal experts to develop and promote cybersecurity education and 
awareness campaigns.

Cyberattacks do not only affect large 
institutions; individuals can also be 
susceptible to cyberattacks. The City 
will produce a series of trainings that 
focus on basic steps individuals can 
take to improve online security. These 
steps include password improvement, 
multifactor authentication, use of free 
mobile security apps, safe browsing 
habits, and in-person verification for 
any email or other communication that 
asks for a transfer of funds. The Los 
Angeles region loses more than $5 million 
per month to cyberattacks targeting 

individuals and small businesses.23 The 
City can significantly mitigate those losses 
by improving Angelenos’ technological 
literacy and providing essential training in 
cybersecurity.

Citywide Cybersecurity  
Awareness Training 
More than 30,000 City employees, 
contractors, and student workers have 
access to City computer systems. The City 
will require all personnel with access to 
these systems to undergo an online cyber 
security awareness training program. 
This training will foster better awareness 

of security protection and policies for 
computer users, educate users on best 
practices, and prevent the introduction 
of malicious intrusions into City computer 
systems. The training will include a basic 
series of required modules that can be 
supplemented by department heads with 
additional training based on the types of 
information handled by particular depart-
ments or employees. In the future, the 
City may require annual training to ensure 
that employees remain vigilant against 
cyberattacks and are kept up to date on 
the most current methods of protection.

  TERRORISM AND CYBERSECURITY

Threats and acts of terrorism have 
far-reaching and deeply intimate impacts. 
They have increasingly disrupted places 
where we work, learn, and gather. The 
attack on public employees in nearby San 
Bernardino was one of the deadliest on 
U.S. soil since 9/11, leaving 14 people dead 
and 22 seriously injured. The preservation 
of civil rights and civil liberties is key 
to Los Angeles’ approach to fighting 
terrorism.  Early efforts by the Interagency 
Coordination Group, which included 
partners such as the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff’s Department, Los Angeles Police 
Department (LAPD), and U.S. Department 
of Homeland Security (DHS), promoted 
an approach of building interagency trust 

and developing strategies to formulate 
a “whole community” approach. The Los 
Angeles framework includes three pillars: 
prevention, intervention, and interdiction.24 

The City also continues to strengthen 
defenses to cybersecurity threats. In 
2013, the City created the Cyber Intrusion 
Command Center (CICC) to lead cyber-
security preparation and response across 
City departments. The CICC created the 
Integrated Security Operations Center as 
its security operations center and aggre-
gated data from the City, proprietary 
departments, private vendors, and the FBI 
and other federal partners.

GROW PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE PUBLIC, PRIVATE, 
AND NONPROFIT SECTORS TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES 
TO VULNERABLE ANGELENOS IN TIMES OF CRISIS

The City will deepen private, nonprofit, and government partnerships to address the needs of all Angelenos, 
including the City’s most vulnerable—young people, the elderly, and those with medical needs—to ensure 
they are prepared for, and supported, following emergency situations.

The City will map key community services 
at the neighborhood level that can help 
Angelenos to identify where to turn 
in a crisis for additional support. The 
City will use data to grow partnerships 
with organizations that are poised to 
support the most vulnerable in the face 

of a disaster. We will also focus on the 
senior populations by ensuring there are 
updated emergency preparedness plans 
at all community centers and increasing 
awareness of the Emergency Alert 
Response System, which provides seniors 
with assistance from a 24-hour emergency 

response center. Finally, we will also 
leverage the Department on Disability’s 
(DOD) technical assistance program to 
ensure that all partner organizations 
incorporate accessibility plans for people 
with disabilities.

  BUILDING RESILIENCE-LA: A PRIMER FOR FACILITIES

In 2016, the U.S. Green Building Council, 
Los Angeles Chapter (USGBC-LA) created 
“Building Resilience-LA: A Primer for 
Facilities.” This guidebook was written for 
owners and operators of buildings in our 
region who want to incorporate resilience 
into operations and maintenance activities 
over time. From emergency planning to 
community building, the guide provides 
a step-by-step process to prepare for 
disasters in ways that yield immediate 
benefits. The guidebook is available online 
at www.resilience.la.

Mayor Eric Garcetti states, “Building 
Resilience-LA assembled a strong 
coalition with representation from 
academia, architecture, engineering, 
and community-based organizations. Its 
inclusion of social resilience has energized 
Los Angeles’ discussion of these pressing 
issues and promises to help our city 
ensure that our residents, businesses, and 
institutions can prepare for and respond

to earthquakes, the effects of climate 
change, and many other stressors with 
flexibility and equity. The City of  
Los Angeles is proud to be a part of  

the Building Resilience-LA coalition.  
Its work will make Los Angeles a stronger, 
healthier, and more connected place  
to live.”

INCREASE ACCESS TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND 
MITIGATION RESOURCES FOR BUSINESSES

7

PROVIDE ANGELENOS ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL  
TRAUMA RESOURCES  

Foster private-sector investments in risk-reduction measures, particularly by local businesses, to address 
vulnerabilities and improve our ability to bounce back after a major disaster. 

The City will develop additional trauma resources for Angelenos to increase their ability to cope today and 
in the event of a catastrophic event. 

The City will expand partnerships with 
the private sector that increase business 
resilience by encouraging businesses of all 
sizes to better understand their risks and 
vulnerabilities and take simple actions to 
address them. When these businesses are 
able to bounce back after an interruption, 
they are better prepared to get employees 
back to work, serve their customers, and 
assist their neighbors in times of need. 

The City will disseminate information 
by reaching out to the networks 
throughout local business communities, 
including chambers and associations, 
Business Source Centers, and Business 
Improvement District (BID) leaders to 
disseminate information about emergency 
preparedness, recovery planning, and 
supply-chain assessments. Business 
resilience requires the private sector to 

look beyond individual preparedness to 
examine dependencies and interdepen-
dencies that prioritize telecom, utility,  
and suppliers that provide access to  
basic goods.

The City will work with local universities 
and trauma experts, including the Mayor’s 
Crisis Response Team volunteers, to 
do outreach throughout Los Angeles 
to educate people, via the Community 
Resiliency Model (CRM), on such items as: 
•  Tracking the effect of trauma on the 

central nervous system.

•  Sharing resources with others who have 

experienced trauma (family, friends, 

and support systems, including religious 
organizations and victim services).

•  Mindfulness-based behavioral therapy 
of grounding, which eases the effects of 
trauma on the individual and therefore 
the community in which they live.  

The goal of CRM is to “help create 
‘trauma-informed’ and ‘resiliency-focused 
communities.’” 25 In just a few hours, 

participants can learn the three steps 
of CRM while also learning how to train 
others in the three-step resilience model. 

In addition, the City will hold an annual 
resource fair to distribute information 
about personal resilience-building tools, 
sustainable mental health treatment, and 
other City services available to community 
members to ensure they are connected to 
all available resources.

GROW PARTNERSHIPS THAT EXPAND SUPPORT FOR 
ANIMALS AFTER A MAJOR SHOCK

The City will promote technology and programs that will assist in the temporary sheltering and reunification 
of animals with their owners or natural environments.

By expanding partnerships with nonprofits 
and foundations, the City can work to 
develop programs that help locate and 
shelters animals before a disaster. As part 
of a disaster response plan, this effort 
will help the City and its partners protect 
animals and reunite pets with owners. The 
Department of Animal Services (DAS) aims 
to successfully reunite animals by using 
photos taken at the time of impound and 

compare them with disaster records—
both in physical and digital copies. The 
department also urges all pet owners 
to microchip their pets to streamline the 
reunification process. To activate facilities 
for the continued housing of displaced 
animals, shelters will determine their avail-
ability for intake and proceed accordingly. 
Further, remote shelters will be set up 
near the busiest evacuation centers, with 

equestrian centers contacted for activa-
tion in coordination with the Los Angeles 
County Animal Control. These efforts 
will also seek to protect wild and exotic 
animals that could appear in urban areas 
by working with the California Department 
of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), as well as 
coordinated response, including LAFD 
and the L.A. Zoo, to protect and evacuate 
L.A. Zoo animals.

EXPAND ACCESS TO FINANCIAL LITERACY AND SECURITY 
RESOURCES FOR ALL ANGELENOS

Leverage existing workforce development, financial, and career coaching programs to provide Angelenos 
with the tools to be financially sustainable and to be able to withstand shocks and stresses. 

Increased financial literacy and security 
for all Angelenos strengthens their ability 
to withstand a minor or major disruption 
without the need for immediate assistance. 
Angelenos’ ability to maintain sufficient 
shelter, store food and water for a week, 
and miss multiple days of work depends 
on their ability to save enough to address 
these immediate needs.

 

The City is committed to assisting our most 
financially vulnerable Angelenos with tar-
geted workforce development programs, 
financial coaching, job coaching, career 
pathway programs, and other supportive 
services that are provided at each of the 
City’s 17 WorkSource Centers and through 
the network of community-based orga-
nizations. These education and training 
opportunities include job skills, technical 

skills, management skills, and financial 
literacy to allow Angelenos to effectively 
leverage new and existing partnerships. 
The City will work with partners to further 
develop and coordinate opportunities 
to increase financial literacy and embed 
financial empowerment practices in other 
programs that will reach vulnerable and 
marginalized Angelenos.

VENTANILLA DE ASESORÍA FINANCIERA PROGRAM

In 2016, the Ventanilla de Asesoría 
Financiera (Financial Empowerment 
Window) program was launched in part-
nership between the City of Los Angeles, 
the Consulate General of Mexico, Citi 
Foundation, and the Youth Policy Institute 
(YPI). The program provides free, culturally 
and linguistically competent financial 
counseling and education resources 
at the Consulate General of Mexico in 
Los Angeles. More than 17,000 Mexican 
Consulate visitors received financial 
education or financial coaching services 
at the Ventanilla de Asesoría Financiera 

in the first 16 months of the program, in 
addition to gaining access to free tax 
preparation, matched savings accounts, 
and other financial empowerment services 
from YPI.

Learning from Ventanilla de Asesoría 
Financiera, the City will work with other 
partners to create and expand financial 
empowerment programs and services 
that assist immigrants in becoming more 
financially secure. This model is being 
replicated in other parts of the country 
as a way to integrate immigrants into the 
financial mainstream.

Safe and Thriving Angelenos

   

ECONOMIC RESILIENCE

Quickly recovering from or adjusting to 
the impacts of a shock or stress requires 
economic means. Having a rainy day fund 
allows typical operations to continue when 
regular income is disrupted or decreased. 
This is the first step in being more eco-
nomically resilient. An individual or family 
must have enough savings to weather 
unexpected expenses, such as emergency 
medical or legal fees, or a major eco-
nomic event, such as the loss of a job. 

A 2016 survey revealed that nearly 70% 
of Americans have less than $1,000 in 
their savings accounts and 34% have no 
savings at all.27 These statistics suggest 
that a large amount of work needs to be 
done to boost our economic resilience.28 

Many individuals find it difficult to amass 
significant long-term savings given the 
city’s high prices for basic necessities 
like housing, transportation, and food. 
Angelenos without savings are especially 
vulnerable to costly sources of short-
term financial relief, such as high-interest 
predatory loans. This only compounds the 
effects of economic shocks and stresses 
by trapping borrowers in debt for years. It 
is important that Angelenos have the tools 
and opportunities to bolster their eco-
nomic resilience to build financial security, 
literacy, and overall wealth. Economically 
stable and secure Angelenos are key to 
a more economically prosperous and 
resilient Los Angeles.

ESTABLISH A CAPITAL PROJECT PIPELINE THAT  
CREATES LIVING-WAGE JOBS FOR LOS ANGELES’  
MOST DISADVANTAGED 

The region will work together to leverage once-in-a-generation investment in public infrastructure toward 
increasing jobs for Angelenos in neighborhoods that are disproportionately unemployed. 

The unemployment rate in some Los 
Angeles neighborhoods is more than 
double the citywide unemployment rate.26 
Meanwhile, these neighborhoods are 
experiencing investments in transit, water 
and power infrastructure, sidewalks, 

housing, and open spaces due to regional 
and city investments over the next 10 
years. These public investments provide 
an opportunity to advance equitable 
outcomes through increased employment 
opportunities. The City will work with City 

departments, regional partners, and 
private-sector partners to include  
local and targeted hire programs into 
these projects.

COLLABORATE WITH ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS TO  
TARGET INVESTMENT 

Work with local institutions to develop policies that encourage local hiring, contracting, and  
procurement to ensure that economic opportunities generated by major employers are  
accessible to nearby communities.

To expand the economic opportunities 
accessible to local residents, the City will 
work with anchor institutions to advance 
policies and programs that both encour-
age and facilitate local hiring, contracting, 

and procurement. Los Angeles is home to 
numerous world-renowned anchor insti-
tutions, such as universities and hospitals, 
that can significantly increase economic 
opportunities for neighboring communities 

that surround them. For example, anchor 
institutions could increase local hiring 
while the City better aligns workforce 
training programs with the needs of these 
major employers.

INCREASE ACCESS TO FREE WI-FI TO HELP REDUCE 
TECHNOLOGY DISPARITIES

The City will partner with internet providers to expand Wi-Fi access to all Angelenos, with a focus on  
vulnerable populations. 

In today’s digital age, high-speed inter-
net access is essential for Angelenos 
to communicate, make a living, and 
access critical emergency information 
before, during, and after a disaster. The 
Los Angeles Information Technology 
Agency (ITA) estimates that up to 30% 

of Angelenos do not have access to 
high-speed internet.29 The City will build 
on existing efforts that expand wireless 
internet access, with a focus on reaching 
vulnerable populations and developing 
applications for both everyday and 
post-disaster use. Expanded access will 

target locations such as public libraries, 
bus shelters, streetlights, and publicly 
accessible cell phone kiosks, as well as 
areas that serve Angelenos experiencing 
homelessness.

RAISE THE WAGE LA

Beginning July 1, 2016, the minimum wage 
in the City of Los Angeles was raised 
to $10.50 per hour and will continue to 
increase annually until it reaches $15.00 
per hour on July 1, 2021. The Office of 
Wage Standards (OWS) of the Bureau of 
Contract Administration is responsible 
for implementing and administering the 
guidelines of the Los Angeles Minimum 
Wage and Minimum Wage Enforcement 
Ordinances in the City of Los Angeles. The 
OWS ensures that employers in the city 
comply with the appropriate minimum- 
wage rates specified by the ordinance 
through community outreach and investi-
gation of potential wage-theft violations.

IDENTIFY, CULTIVATE, AND INCUBATE HIGH-GROWTH 
SECTORS WHILE PROMOTING ECONOMIC MOBILITY

Grow promising new industries, while partnering with colleges and trade-oriented institutions, to skillfully 
train local labor to qualify for these fields.

To promote economic mobility for a 
greater number of Angelenos and align 
job training programs with the City’s next 
wave of innovation, the Economic and 
Workforce Development Department 
(EWDD) will work with the Workforce 
Development Board (WDB) and economic 
development industry and workforce 
leaders to continue to identify policy tools 

and training programs that can fuel the 
growth of promising new homegrown 
industries. This coordinated approach will 
ensure that the City’s existing economic 
and workforce development programs 
stay ahead of the curve and that the 
economic returns from Los Angeles–based 
research and development flow back into 
our local communities. EWDD operates 

17 WorkSource Centers and two portal 
offices, which provide free employment 
and training services to Angelenos, 
including specialized training to support 
high-growth industry sectors like bio-
science and green technology. These 
centers will continue to adapt workforce 
skill-building while promoting equitable 
access for all Angelenos.

EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS THAT ENCOURAGE REINTEGRATION 
AND SUCCESSFUL REENTRY OF PREVIOUSLY 
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS

Continue to develop resources and partnerships to reverse the cycles of long-term unemployment,  
instability, and displacement that grip the formerly incarcerated community.

Each year, more than 45,000 people 
are paroled to Los Angeles County and 
over 163,000 individuals pass through 
the County Jail system. The majority of 
these individuals return to the City of Los 
Angeles, and research shows that up to 
70% of formerly incarcerated individuals 
identify employment as their biggest 
hurdle to successful reentry. A recent study 

estimated that between 85% and 89% 
of formerly incarcerated individuals are 
unemployed at any given time.30 However, 
formerly incarcerated individuals are 
much less likely to return to jail if they 
obtain employment. The recidivism rate 
in California plummets from 65% to as 
low as 3% when formerly incarcerated 
individuals are paired with jobs soon after 

release. The City will continue to work 
with partners to reduce the barriers to 
successful reentry by expanding resources 
and job opportunities. The City’s current 
transitional employment program for 
formerly incarcerated individuals has a 
recidivism rate of just 1.5%.

STRENGTHEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG ANGELENOS  
TO CONNECT WITH CIVIC LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS 

Double the number of young people participating in civic opportunities by working with partners to expand 
civic engagement programs.

GOAL 3: CULTIVATE LEADERSHIP, 
STEWARDSHIP, AND EQUITY WITH 
YOUNG ANGELENOS

BUILD PARTNERSHIPS THAT STRENGTHEN THE  
EDUCATION-TO-CAREER PIPELINE 

Expand partnerships to prepare more young Angelenos to succeed in postsecondary education,  
ultimately connecting them to career opportunities.

Beginning fall 2017, the Los Angeles 
College Promise will increase the number 
of community college graduates and 
promote economic mobility by preparing 
more young Angelenos for quality jobs. 
L.A. College Promise will cover one 
year of tuition for Los Angeles Unified 
School District (LAUSD) and charter 
school graduates at nine Los Angeles 
Community College District (LACCD) 
colleges. It will also provide these students 

with academic and student support 
services—such as career coaching and 
mentorship opportunities—to help them 
complete their education. In addition, 
HIRE L.A.’s Youth initiative will expand to 
connect 20,000 young Angelenos with 
summer internships or year-round, full-time 
employment by 2020, up from 15,000 in 
2017. This partnership among the City, 
local schools, workforce development 
programs, community colleges, and 

community-based organizations provides 
workforce training and other job 
preparation services and then links youth 
with local employment opportunities.  
The City will work to expand opportunities 
for young people in promising careers 
related to resilience by seeking additional 
partnerships with employers in fields  
such as clean technology and community 
preparedness. 

The City of Los Angeles works with 
thousands of young people each year 
through myriad programs supported by 
the Mayor’s Office and City departments 
with support from additional partners. 
These programs provide young Angelenos 
with opportunities for civic engagement, 
leadership development, as well as 
exposure to career and mentor opportu-
nities. These and other programs should 
be available to any young Angelenos who 
are interested in participating. 

MAYOR’S YOUTH COUNCIL 
The Mayor’s Youth Council is a one-year 
program for Los Angeles high school stu-
dents designed to promote civic engage-
ment and inspire the next generation of 
civic leaders. The Youth Council empowers 
members to advocate for causes import-
ant to their communities and elevate their 
voices in City Hall. Topics include civic 
leadership, community landscaping, grass-
roots organizing, civic engagement at the 
college level, public speaking, professional 
development, and community service.

CIVIC UNIVERSITY  
A program offered by Cal State LA’s 
College of Professional and Global 
Education, in partnership with the Mayor’s 
Office and the Mayor’s Youth Council, Civic 
University aims to increase Angelenos’ 
understanding of how their local govern-
ment system works in support of building 
a well-informed and engaged civic 
community.

NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL CIVIC 
YOUTH LEADERSHIP ACADEMY 
The City’s Department of Neighborhood 
Empowerment offers a leadership 
program designed for youth and 

young adults aged 14 to 24, called the 
Neighborhood Council Civic Youth 
Leadership Academy. Classes are held 
over the summer and culminate in a 
community civil-engagement project.

SUMMER NIGHT LIGHTS AND 
FALL FRIDAY NIGHTS 
The Summer Night Lights (SNL) program 
is a public and private partnership led by 
the City of Los Angeles Mayor’s Office of 
Gang Reduction & Youth Development 
(GRYD) and The GRYD Foundation. 
Summer Night Lights is part of the GRYD 
Comprehensive Strategy, which is ded-
icated to diminishing the influence of 
gangs and gang violence. SNL operates 
at 32 park locations across the City of 
Los Angeles, keeping recreation centers 
and parks open and adding extended 
programming between the hours of 7 p.m. 
and 11 p.m. during the summer. With the 
assistance of Youth Squad members, SNL 
expands the typical menu of activities at 
each site, offering sports, art, recreational 
activities, resource fairs, health screenings, 
workshops, jobs, and connections to 
resources that residents can use year-
round. From September to November, Fall 
Friday Nights extends the SNL services at 
select locations.

LOS ANGELES FIRE 
DEPARTMENT GIRLS CAMP  
Girls ages 14 through 18 are invited to 
explore the possibility of a future career

LOS ANGELES FIRE 
DEPARTMENT YOUTH ACADEMY 
AND CADET PROGRAM  
The Fire Instruction Recruitment and 
Education (F.I.R.E.) program introduces 
firefighting as a career option for young 
Angelenos and has grown to include four 
High School Fire Academies from East Los 
Angeles, West Los Angeles, San Pedro, 
and the Valley. Students learn about basic 
engine company operation and equip-
ment, basic truck company operations, 
and truck tools and equipment. The next 
step in the learning process is the Fire 
Cadet Program, which teaches young 
men and women about firefighting and 
emergency medical services as potential 
career paths.

LOS ANGELES POLICE 
DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS 
The LAPD operates a number of programs 
aimed at engaging and enriching youth 
and community relationship-building. The 
largest of these programs is the LAPD 
Cadet program, which is designed to 
offer youth an opportunity to develop 
skills that will help them throughout their 
lives while working with the LAPD. The 
program is offered at each of the 21 
community police stations across the City, 
as well as at seven specialized divisions. 
The Police Orientation and Preparation 
Program, Police Activity League, and 
Police Academy Magnet School Program 
are similar programs focused on various 
aspects of youth crime prevention that 
rely on educational, athletic, and other 
recreational activities to cement a bond 
between police officers and the youth in 
our community.

INCREASE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES BY GENERATING 
AWARENESS AND USE OF CITY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES 
THAT REDUCE VIOLENCE

The City will leverage and enhance the existing Gang Reduction Youth Development (GRYD) model to train 
outreach staff to provide targeted engagement around public safety and service needs in communities most 
impacted by crime or that commonly face barriers to employment.

The GRYD model is a comprehensive 
strategy that involves the provision of 
prevention services, gang-intervention 
services, violence-interruption activities, 
and involvement in proactive peacemaking 
activities that together strengthen young 
Angelenos, their families, and their commu-
nities, resilience to the influence of gangs. 

The GRYD SNL and Fall Friday Night (FFN) 
programs keep City recreation centers 
and parks open with extended program-
ming into the evenings during the summer 
and fall. A core component to these 
programs are the Youth Squad members, 
who engage with the community all 

through programming throughout the 
summer. Recently, the Youth Squad 360 
program has supported Youth Squad 
members as they pursue their educational 
and career goals through job readiness 
training and financial empowerment. The 
objective of our Youth Squad 360 Initiative 
is to help current and former Youth Squad 
members achieve long-term stability 
and success at home, at school, and in 
the workplace. There is an opportunity 
to expand job-readiness training with 
financial empowerment tools from the 
Youth Squad 360 program to the greater 
GRYD community. 

At the same time, the City is focused 
on reducing gun violence through 
partnerships and gun buyback programs. 
To expand gun violence prevention, 
education, and outreach efforts to 
children, youth, and their families, the City 
will partner with the LAUSD and other 
public and private organizations. This 
comprehensive partnership will combine 
educational and outreach programs, 
training, increased prevention and 
intervention strategies, and expanded 
gun buybacks and other programs that 
remove unwanted or illegal guns from 
homes and the streets.

DEPLOY EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS  
AND PARTNERSHIPS TO PREVENT AND REDUCE  
YOUTH HOMELESSNESS

The City will continue to identify new workforce program opportunities and expand existing workforce 
development programs serving youth who are homeless or at risk for homelessness.

The City will continue to expand its 
programs that provide workforce 
training, employment opportunities, and 
financial literacy to homeless youth and 
those who are at risk. These programs 
include the City YouthSource Centers, 
the Los Angeles Regional Initiative for 
Social Enterprise (L.A. RISE), Hire L.A., the 
Summer Youth Employment Program, and 
the L.A. Cadet program.

According to national data, between 
31% and 46% of youth who exit foster 
care experience homelessness at least 
once by age 26.31 Foster youth who are 
at the age to transition out of foster care, 
and under the supervision of the County 
Department of Children and Family 
Services or Probation Department, will not 
be discharged without a housing option. 
However, foster youth are not tracked 

after they exit the foster care system— 
and if a youth’s location is unknown after 
discharge, their case is terminated.  
While L.A. County predominantly serves 
foster youth, the City also will monitor 
County strategies to reduce homelessness 
for individuals formerly in foster care and 
explore opportunities for the City  
to partner with the County to support  
this work.

GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM

The City has committed to expanding 
its gun violence prevention initiatives, 
and have set a new goal—to take at 
least 25,000 guns off the streets of Los 
Angeles over the next five years. The City 
will make this happen through a number 
of measures—including expansion of 
the City’s long-running gun buyback 
program via partnerships with non-profit 
organizations such as GunXGun, which 
will crowdsource additional support 
for buyback efforts—and supporting 
expansion and development of the LAPD’s 
Crime Gun Intelligence Center, which was 
created through a $1 million federal grant. 
The Center will allow the City to coordinate 
local and federal resources to get more 
guns off the streets of Los Angeles.

WORK WITH YOUNG ANGELENOS TO REDUCE CRIME  
AND VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY WHERE TEENS AND  
YOUTH ARE VICTIMS  

The City will strengthen support for programs that engage young Angelenos in promoting awareness of 
teen and youth safety.

Using a combination of expanded 
services, increased training, and targeted 
awareness campaigns, the City will work 
to reinforce strategies aimed at reducing 
crime and violence, particularly against 
youth and teenage victims. By engaging 
service providers, government partners, 
law enforcement, schools, community 
based organizations, and others, the 
City will bolster community discussions 
that engage youth leaders and adult 
supporters to unite against teen and 
youth violence. 

The City’s GRYD program has been laser 
focused on strengthening youth,  family, 
and community resiliency to the influence 
of gangs by fostering public-private 
collaborations and supporting commu-
nity-based prevention, intervention and 

juvenile reentry services. In 2017 GRYD 
reduced Gang-Related Violent Crime in 
its target areas by nearly 10%, and GRYD 
Incident Response prevented an estimated 
185 gang-related violent crimes over a 
two-year period, including an estimated 
10 fewer homicides. The City will continue 
to refine and target GRYD’s efforts to 
promote youth safety across impacted 
communities citywide.  

These efforts will also include citywide 
expansion of first responder training in 
identifying and providing support to 
commercially sexually exploited children 
and victims of domestic violence, and 
community outreach that raises public 
awareness around teen dating violence 
and child trafficking.  

The National Human Trafficking Resource 
Center lists California as the state with the 
highest number of reported sex-trafficking 
victims, with 682 cases reported in 2017. 
In 2018, the City’s Commission on the 
Status of Women and the Mayor’s Office 
jointly launched a media campaign “Look 
Again,” which seeks to raise awareness 
and educate the public on child sex 
trafficking/human trafficking. Developed 
in partnership with the LAPD, TBW/Chiat/
Day, and others, the campaign included a 
PSA feature at Los Angeles World Airports, 
posters on exteriors of DASH and Metro 
buses; and an agreement with Regal 
Cinemas to feature the PSA in theaters in 
Los Angeles.

  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS NO PLACE HERE

  

One in three teens is a victim of dating 
abuse. To promote teen dating violence 
awareness, the Mayor’s Office and the 
advertising agency Quigley-Simpson 
joined forces on a Valentine’s Day–inspired 
public education campaign titled 
Domestic Violence Has No Place Here. 
The campaign was developed in obser-
vance of National Teen Dating Violence 
Awareness Month, with feedback from 
domestic violence community service 

providers and stakeholders. It featured 
provocative statements such as “I Own 
You,” “Fear Me,” and “Without Me You Are 
Nothing” printed in English and Spanish 
on bus benches and bus shelters citywide. 
These ads inform the public of domestic 
violence statistics as well as sharing infor-
mation about the Mayor’s Office domestic 
violence awareness campaign website, 
www.NoDVLA.org.

DEVELOP THE NEXT GENERATION OF STEWARDS OF  
LOS ANGELES TO BE LEADERS IN CLIMATE AND  
DISASTER RESILIENCE 

Working closely with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and other partners, the City will 
develop and implement programs that educate young Angelenos about new and increasing risks and 
vulnerabilities they face and empower them to find the best solutions.

The City will continue to support and 
collaborate with LAUSD and other 
educational partners to promote initiatives 
that increase the awareness of resilience 
challenges—including climate resilience, 
conservation, disaster resilience, public 
health and safety, and equity—while 

building students’ skills in science, 
technology, and other fields critical to 
addressing these challenges. For example, 
by learning about earthquakes and our 
water and energy systems, students 
can take action by participating in the 
newest science research or conserving 

both energy and water every day. 
Future collaborations may also include 
increased civic responsibility and public 
safety, including preparedness and 
injury prevention education as well as 
developing innovations that address 
mitigation, response, and recovery.

  RISK LABS
In 2016, the Mayor’s Office, Caltech, 
Dr. Lucy Jones, Pacifico, and Mujeres 
de la Tierra held the first Los Angeles 
Risk Lab in Cypress Park. The lab 
focused on understanding seismic 
risks through science experiments and 
expert discussions. The City will look for 
opportunities to partner on future labs 
addressing additional risks, including 
increased heat, drought, or sea level rise.

Resilient Los AngelesResilient Los AngelesA resilient 
neighborhood 
adapts to 
change.

DO YOU KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS?

One-third of Americans say they’ve never interacted with the people 
living next door.32 If you haven’t met your neighbor, what are you 
waiting for? Building strong and connected neighborhoods starts with 
you. There are a number of ways to meet and collaborate with your 
neighbors, and many are highlighted in this chapter. 

Because Los Angeles is nearly 500 square miles, with a landscape that 
spans beaches and mountain ranges, no two neighborhoods have 
the same risks, vulnerabilities, or opportunities. In Los Angeles, one 
size does not fit all. We must work together to identify the greatest 
shocks and stresses within each neighborhood. Some of these risks 
include sea level rise in Venice, wildfires in Chatsworth, landslides in 
Hollywood, power outages in San Pedro, and increasing extreme heat 
in El Sereno.

Disparities in health, wealth, and access to goods and services exist 
in far too many of our neighborhoods. Addressing inequality through 
inclusive policies, programs, and practices—and working with trusted 
community partners—will increase neighborhood-based resources 
and stewardship, ultimately creating greater social cohesion.

INTEGRATE RESILIENCE INTO COMMUNITY PLAN UPDATES 
BY INCLUDING A RISK AND VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS 
WITH POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES THAT 
ADDRESS EACH NEIGHBORHOOD

Engage with neighborhoods through the Community Plan updates to evaluate community-specific assets, 
risks, and vulnerabilities and develop tailored, neighborhood-scale resilience priorities to inform key policy 
and implementation decisions.

The City of Los Angeles will be working 
to update all 35 Community Plans by 
2024. Through the Community Plans 
update process, the City will work with 
communities to incorporate principles 
that address the most prevalent risks 

in each area. By integrating risk and 
vulnerability assessments—as well as 
specific neighborhood-scale resilience 
strategies—into existing community 
planning processes, we can provide the 
long-range planning needed to address 

each neighborhood’s individual challenges 
and opportunities. No two neighborhoods 
in Los Angeles are alike, and addressing 
specific assets, risks, and vulnerabilities will 
make communities even stronger.

CONNECT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXPERTS AND 
RESOURCES TO GUIDE AND EFFICIENTLY SUPPORT THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF NEIGHBORHOOD RESILIENCE HUBS

The City will provide tools and networks to encourage the creation of Neighborhood 
Resilience Hubs by streamlining regulatory and policy processes and by connecting organi-
zations with partners that can provide guidance, technical assistance, and financial capacity.

Neighborhood Resilience Hubs are physical spaces, housed within trusted 
community organizations, that facilitate social and climate resilience along 
with disaster preparedness and recovery. Ultimately, Hubs will play a critical 
role in addressing chronic community stressors during blue-sky days as well 
as in facilitating emergency response and recovery in times of crisis.   
Chosen for their ease of accessibility by 
biking or walking and for their capacity 
to reach vulnerable populations, Hubs 
will be fortified with the most up-to-date 
electricity, water, communications, and 
seismic technologies to ensure that critical 
services are maintained during and after 
a disaster. This will allow Hubs to facilitate 
disaster response and recovery efforts.  
On an everyday basis, Hubs will also 
foster social cohesion while addressing 
chronic community stressors through 
outreach, education, and connections  
to existing social and environmental 
stewardship programs and services.

include best practices and key elements 
of hub planning and engagement, with 
suggestions for fostering community- 
led discussions around risk and 
vulnerability, prioritization of 
programmatic elements, and ongoing 
operations and management.

Establish Neighborhood Resilience Hubs 
Advisory Group 
The advisory group will be a collabora-
tive outreach effort between nonprofit 
partners and representatives from City 
departments.

Create an Online Resilience  
Resource Hub 
A website will provide resilience-related 
information from the City and its partners 
—such as disaster preparedness tips 
and links to workforce development 
programs—so that all Angelenos  
can access the variety of social services 
already provided by agencies and 
organizations across Los Angeles. 
The Online Hub will also be a forum 
through which physical hubs can 
forge partnerships with other existing 
organizations, allowing service providers 
to more effectively reach Angelenos with 
the greatest need.

KEY ELEMENTS OF 
NEIGHBORHOOD RESILIENCE HUBS

Create a Hub Planning Toolkit 
The City will connect with known and 
trusted community organizations that 
people are most likely to turn to in times 
of crisis or disaster. The City will support 
these trusted organizations in identifying 
tools and resources necessary to launch 
Neighborhood Resilience Hubs. For 
example, a Hub Planning Toolkit will

LAUNCH THE CAMPUS RESILIENCE CHALLENGE

Promote and encourage innovative actions that advance physical resilience and social cohesion by 
engaging local institutional partners.

Los Angeles is home to numerous 
world-renowned institutions, including 
universities, hospitals, and film studios, 
that are well-positioned to be leaders 
and role models in resilience because 
of their size and impact on surrounding 
communities. Building on existing efforts 
with California State University, Los 
Angeles; California State University, 
Northridge; University of California, Los 
Angeles (UCLA); and others, the City will 

partner with these academic institutions to 
develop and launch a Campus Resilience 
Challenge. Participants will participate 
in a Campus Resilience advisory group, 
share training and resilience planning and 
implementation resources, and receive 
recognition from the City. Many of these 
institutions have already signed Second 
Nature’s Climate Commitment to carbon 
neutrality and resilience. The Challenge 
will first be offered to universities and 

colleges and then be extended to other 
academic institutions and private-
sector campuses. By convening major 
institutions and promoting idea-sharing, 
the Campus Resilience Challenge will 
encourage innovations in community 
resilience-building while establishing 
a network of institutions that can 
communicate resilience awareness to 
surrounding neighborhoods.

DEVELOPING PREPAREDNESS PLANS 

Encourage community-level stewardship and resilience by publicizing and disseminating program materials 
that will help neighborhoods develop plans and strategies that increase neighborhood disaster readiness 
and resilience.

Neighbors rely on one another in times  
of crisis. Since we know it is a matter of 
when, not if a disaster will strike, it is essen-
tial that every Los Angeles neighborhood 
has a plan in place to prepare for and 
recover from an emergency. 

There are many types of neighborhood 
planning programs—provided both by 
the City and community preparedness 
organizations—each tailored to time, 
capacity, and subject matter.

PLANNING FOR NEIGHBORHOOD PREPAREDNESS 

COOL BLOCKS 
Cool Blocks is an action-based program 
that informs Angelenos of actions 
they can take to improve disaster 
preparedness, adopt water stewardship 
practices, and reduce their carbon 
footprints. The Neighborhood Council 
Sustainability Alliance has partnered 
with the City of Los Angeles and the 
Empowerment Institute on a Cool 
Blocks pilot program in Los Angeles 
neighborhoods. 

READY YOUR L.A. NEIGHBORHOOD 
(RYLAN) 
The City of Los Angeles is developing 
a neighborhood disaster planning 
toolkit that builds on the City’s existing 
five steps to neighborhood resilience 
planning. Neighborhoods can increase 
their preparedness and neighborhood 
coordination by defining the area, 
recruiting leaders, analyzing specific risks 
and vulnerabilities, building a team, and 
developing a plan. The updated toolkit 
will be available in spring 2018. 

PREPARE LA 
The American Red Cross of Southern 
California is conducting a multiyear 
planning effort with neighborhoods in Los 
Angeles to support community leaders in 
developing resilience plans. Participating 
neighborhoods include Koreatown, Van 
Nuys, Westlake, Pico-Union, Pacoima, and 
South Los Angeles.

INCREASE NEIGHBORHOOD OUTREACH AND EDUCATION 
AROUND WILDFIRE AND MUDSLIDE RISK REDUCTION IN 
OUR MOST VULNERABLE NEIGHBORHOODS 

In partnership with Neighborhood Councils and CERT teams, the City will expand outreach and education 
focusing on areas most vulnerable to wildfire and mudslides.

The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) 
has a number of existing programs that 
help educate Angelenos on reducing fire 
and flood risks, including Brush Clearance; 
Ready, Set, Go!; and The Nine Steps to 
Flood Recovery. Through a coordinated 
multi-departmental effort and in part-
nership with Neighborhood Councils 
and CERT teams, the City will expand 

outreach and education in communities 
with high fire-hazard risk, including areas 
with steep topography or located at the 
wildland-urban interface. Educational 
efforts will focus on ways to reduce fire 
risk and how to respond when a fire or 
mudslide does occur to help communities 
stay safe and ensure that firefighters can 
focus resources on preventing loss of 

lives and damage to property. Increasing 
community-level knowledge around wildfire 
and mudslide risk will help build capacity 
within neighborhoods to protect against 
and be prepared for these events, includ-
ing proactive risk reduction, evacuation, 
response, and recovery actions.

  FIRE RISK
In 2017, Los Angeles County faced six 
large fires—defined by the California 
Department of Forestry and Fire 
Protection (CalFire) as those greater than 
or equal to 300 burned acres—including 
the Lake, Placerita, La Tuna, Rye, Creek, 
and Skirball fires. These fires alone burned 
more than 30,000 acres of both urban and 
wildland, destroying or damaging nearly 
250 structures, contributing to California’s 
worst fire season in recorded history.33 

As Los Angeles’ Mediterranean climate—
characterized by dry summers and 
seasonal winter rain—adjusts to a new 
normal in the face of climate change, 
longer and hotter periods of drought 
followed by heavy rains will intensify the 
existing conditions for wildfires. These 
climatic factors are further exacerbated 
by Los Angeles’ hilly and peri-urban 
terrains, which, while often attractive 
for residential uses, are at risk of 
overcrowding as the population grows. 

Photo: Office of Mayor Garcetti

As a consequence of these changing 
conditions, wildfires in Los Angeles are 
likely to become both more frequent and 
devastating. A prime example of this is 
the 2017 Thomas Fire and the devastating 
landslide, which occurred when an 
intense rain event shortly followed 
the fire. The Thomas Fire is the largest 
wildfire in recorded CalFire history and 
engulfed nearly 300,000 acres, over 1,000 
structures, and claimed 22 lives (inclusive 
of mudslide fatalities) in neighboring 
Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties.34 35  
This single fire event demonstrates the 
dangerous possibility of increased loss of 
life and irreversible damage to property, 
biodiversity, and air quality.

LAUNCH THE “NEIGHBORLY” MICROGRANTS PROGRAM TO 
BUILD SOCIAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NEIGHBORS

Start a microgrant program that funds community-driven projects to encourage neighbors to work together 
to build resilience in their neighborhoods.

The Neighborly program will build and 
expand interpersonal relationships block 
by block and building by building, allowing 
people to connect on the most basic 
level. Activities supported by Neighborly 
grants can vary based on the block or 

community—from throwing a block party 
to creating a community garden—but all 
grants will encourage Angelenos to learn 
about one another and create a sense of 
pride in where they live. This foundational 
work can develop leaders and help 

residents become more active and 
engaged in the civic life of Los Angeles, 
more empowered to weather challenges, 
and better positioned to maintain their 
sense of community.

EXPAND ACCESS TO CITY SERVICES FOR HOMELESS, 
MARGINALIZED, AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES

Continue to simplify the process for individuals and families experiencing homelessness, marginalization, 
and/or vulnerability, to access housing services by improving the Coordinated Entry System (CES) and 
empowering public-facing City departments to be resources in neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles. 

The No Wrong Door Approach allows 
people to access services in any neigh-
borhood. When Angelenos experience 
homelessness, trying to find the location of 
services without access to technology and 
resources can be challenging—especially 
in a new neighborhood.

However, if the services are coordinated, 
then the myriad systems that can assist 
Angelenos experiencing homelessness 
can be better integrated.

Scaling up the CES is one of the major 
initiatives in the City’s homelessness 
strategy, which includes more than 62 
recommendations to address homeless-
ness over the next 10 years. Through the 
implementation of the No Wrong Door 
approach to City services, Angelenos 
without homes can access resources in 
any neighborhood, from any agency. 
The City is equipping departments with 
tools and information to help them assist 

individuals in accessing housing services. 
These tools and the CES expansion will 
include the integration of outreach teams, 
enhanced data sharing and tracking, 
and specialized services for the most 
vulnerable Angelenos. The expansion 
of emergency shelters into 24-hour 
operations with co-location of local CES 
providers is also being pursued.

  CITY OF IMMIGRANTS

  

Los Angeles celebrates its diversity. 
Angelenos hail from more than 150 
countries and speak over 200 languages. 
More than 40% of Angelenos were born 
in a foreign country, and 66% are either 
immigrants or the children of immigrants. 
Of the nearly 3 million undocumented 
immigrants who live in California, slightly 
over 1 million reside in Los Angeles County 
and most have lived here for an average 
of 10 years.36 Immigrants contribute to 
and improve the economy, making up 
32% of California’s GDP. Yet, California 
households headed by immigrants have 
a per capita income one-quarter below 
average, and households headed by 
undocumented immigrants make close to 
$12,000 less annually, leaving them partic-
ularly at risk for exploitation and abuse.37

While immigrants are a vibrant part of 
society in Los Angeles, foreign-born 
Angelenos also present a challenge when 
it comes to emergency preparedness 
and integration. Linguistic barriers, 
coupled with incomes which may be 
below the poverty level and heightened 
fears stemming from recent immigration-
enforcement actions, leave our immigrant 
population more isolated. Immigrants 
are also more likely to stay within their 
communities and lack trust in government. 
All of these factors place a stress not  
only on the immigrant population residing  
in Los Angeles, but also on their  
family members and the population of  
Los Angeles as a whole.

CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND THE LOS ANGELES 
JUSTICE FUND

The City will strengthen its partnership with the Los Angeles Justice Fund to provide critical assistance to  
Los Angeles’ immigrant populations. 

In Los Angeles County, more than two-
thirds of people appearing in immigration 
court face a judge and federal prosecutor 
without legal representation. The Los 
Angeles Justice Fund is a multi-million 
public-private partnership that aims 
to promote due process and justice by 
increasing access to legal representation 
and counsel for individuals and families 
dealing with immigration court removal 
proceedings. A partnership between 

the City of Los Angeles, L.A. County, the 
California Community Foundation, and 
the Weingart Foundation, the Los Angeles 
Justice Fund provides funding to nonprofit 
legal service organizations currently 
engaged in immigration court cases and 
who represent populations in detention 
centers. The fund will serve vulnerable 
populations including victims of human 
trafficking and DACA recipients.

Organization began to receive funding 
in the fall of 2017. The fund also supports 
pilot programs that seek to expand the 
pool of immigration attorneys available 
to provide representation. These efforts 
prioritize vulnerable populations, including 
women and children.

NEW AMERICANS CENTER

In 2018, the Los Angeles Public Library 
(LAPL) launched New American Centers, 
expanding their Path to Citizenship 
program that began in 2012. LAPL 
partnered with the U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services to provide natural-
ization information and civic engagement 
opportunities to support the City’s immi-
grant population, regardless of status. 
The New Americans Centers function as 
a community go-to for services around 
citizenship, including eligibility screenings, 
naturalization workshops and green card 
renewals, Know Your Rights workshops, 
small business support, family prepared-
ness workshops, family location services, 
and ESL conversation classes. Additional 
services around local civics instruction, 
inter-cultural communication, records locat-
ing, business licensing, and mentoring are 
provided. This initiative reflects the LAPL’s 
continued efforts to welcome everyone and 
to provide a lifeline of support for isolated 
or marginalized populations by providing 
people with information and resources.

EXPAND AN INCLUSIVE NETWORK OF SERVICES THAT 
STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES  
TO COMBAT ALL FORMS OF VIOLENT EXTREMISM 

Build the capacity of nonprofits and community partners to provide services that promote social inclusion.  

The City of Los Angeles is a leader in 
creating robust strategies to build healthy 
communities and strengthen the social 
fabric against all forms of hate and 
bias that can lead to violence. In 2015, 
this approach was codified in the Los 
Angeles Framework, which addresses 
all forms of violent extremism. The City 
is focused on advancing community 
resilience through network-building, 

engagement, trust-building efforts, and 
community-driven preventative programs. 
This work is based on objectives pivotal  
to ensuring effective community engage-
ment around social inclusion, including:
•  Developing a collective vision for 

community-driven impact.

•  Consolidating resources in an accessible 

online platform.

•  Creating a culturally appropriate service 

referral system.

•  Building capacity of community-based 

organizations by facilitating relationships.

•  Raising awareness and elevating civil 

society as a leading voice.

DEVELOP AN URBAN HEAT VULNERABILITY INDEX 
AND MITIGATION PLAN TO PREPARE FOR HIGHER 
TEMPERATURES AND MORE FREQUENT EXTREME HEAT

Develop a framework for prioritizing neighborhoods, engaging stakeholders, creating policies,  
identifying funding sources, and recommending budgets in support of changes that will lead to a  
heat-resilient Los Angeles.

The City will support and participate in 
community-led efforts to identify barriers 
and opportunities to accelerating 
extreme heat mitigation. TreePeople and 
Climate Resolve will bring their expertise 
in partnership-building and complex 
urban environmental problem-solving to 
co-facilitate the creation of a Los Angeles 
Urban Heat Island Mitigation Plan. The 
plan will include policy frameworks and 

directives; a neighborhood prioritization 
framework; engagement toolkits for 
communities, businesses, and other 
stakeholders; and other elements as 
they are identified. The plan will also 
engage with the public health community 
to incorporate a method for identifying 
populations most at risk of heat-related 
health problems and develop plans for 
outreach and intervention on high-heat 

days. The plan will be informed by stake-
holder engagement, including from City 
departments and community members, 
and it will identify City policies that can 
be changed, augmented, or created to 
support heat mitigation. Concurrently, an 
advisory group will provide advice on 
engaging communities in adopting heat 
mitigation practices and behaviors.

  URBAN HEAT ISLAND AND EXTREME HEAT 

URBAN HEAT ISLANDS AND TREE CANOPY

While working to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and fight climate change, the 
City of Los Angeles is also taking proac-
tive steps to adapt to rising temperatures 
and minimize their impact on residents. 

Densely populated cities in warm climates 
like Los Angeles’ often experience the 
urban heat island effect. A combination of 
dark pavement cover, clusters of buildings, 
traffic, and lack of trees creates high tem-
perature hot spots known as heat islands. 
The Sustainable City pLAn set the target to 
curb this phenomenon by reducing urban 
heat by 1.7°F by 2025 and 3° by 2035. Key 
strategies to reach this goal include:
•  Requiring cool roofs for all new and 

refurbished homes. In 2013, Los Angeles 
was the first major city to enact this 
requirement. LADWP provides cool roof 
rebates to help Angelenos offset the cost. 

•  Laying down cool pavement. Los 

Angeles is the first city to pilot cool 
pavements for on-road use.

•  Building up the city’s green infrastructure, 

such as trees for shading and cooling.  

Temperatures have been rising and 
breaking records in recent years. Notably, 
2015 replaced 2014 as the hottest year on 
record in California.38 Climate scientists

at UCLA project that this warming trend 
will continue and that the region will be at 
least 3° warmer between 2040 and 2060, 
even with reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions.39 By 2100, Los Angeles’ average 
annual temperature may increase as much 
as 8° degrees under a business-as-usual 
emissions scenario. Angelenos will also 
face more extreme heat days, which are 
days with temperatures over 95°. All Los 
Angeles communities are projected to 
experience additional extreme heat days 
each year; however, some neighborhoods 
will experience at least twice as many as 
they do today.40  

The city’s urban landscape is covered with 
paved surfaces that absorb heat. This heat 
then reradiates and warms surrounding 
air, creating an urban heat island effect, 
which can add as much as 6–10° to the 
background temperature.41 The rising local 
temperatures and increase in the number 
of heat waves, as well as the increase 
in both the severity and the length 
associated with a single heat wave, also 
significantly impact public health. Hospital 
admissions spike on peak heat-wave days, 
with particular impacts for cardiovascular, 
respiratory, and heat-related illness.42

33

DEVELOP AND LAUNCH A NEIGHBORHOOD RETROFIT PILOT 
PROGRAM TO TEST COOLING STRATEGIES THAT PREPARE 
FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURES

A neighborhood retrofit pilot program to test heat-adaptation strategies will inform future citywide imple-
mentation efforts—including increased vegetation cover, reflectivity, and community empowerment tools.

In partnership with experts, the City 
will support the development of a 
neighborhood retrofit pilot program 
that will test cost-effective cooling 
strategies to increase vegetation cover 
and reflectivity. The retrofit program 
will demonstrate cooling, public health 
improvements, and other benefits for 

residents. It will also feature education 
and engagement supporting community 
action and behavior changes. This will 
be achieved by engaging community 
members in creating retrofit designs that 
are neighborhood-appropriate and by 
offering educational how-to workshops to 
support simple strategies such as planting 

trees and employing naturally cooling 
materials on roofs and other surfaces. 
Through this pilot program, our partners 
will seek to introduce new climate and 
social science, decision-support tools, 
and tangible demonstrations that  
will accelerate Los Angeles’ transition  
to extreme heat resilience.

PLANT TREES IN COMMUNITIES WITH FEWER TREES TO 
GROW A MORE EQUITABLE TREE CANOPY BY 2028

The City will support tree-planting programs and direct urban forestry resources to areas with low canopy 
cover to improve air quality and reduce the impact of increasing heat.

Our city’s urban forest is the largest 
in the nation, but it is also inequitably 
distributed. Communities with low tree 
canopy cover also tend to be burdened 
by poor air quality, higher risk of heat- and 
pollution-related health risks, and lower 
average household incomes. A robust 
tree canopy can provide critical shade 
and evaporative cooling benefits and 
can also improve air quality, stormwater 
management, energy efficiency, and 

overall health. By investing in an equitable 
canopy cover for Los Angeles, we 
will improve the resilience of our most 
vulnerable communities against extreme 
heat, the proliferation of urban heat 
islands, poor air and water quality, flood 
risk, and other cumulative impacts. 

Groups like City Plants will be key 
collaborators in establishing neighbor-
hood buy-in and directing these valuable 

investments to areas that need them 
the most. Increasing the resilience of 
the urban forest will also help ensure an 
equitable canopy cover for generations to 
come. Impacts such as pests can be fatal 
to trees, and their effects are only exacer-
bated by drought and extreme heat. The 
City’s Tree Committee was recently formed 
to spearhead multidepartmental actions 
to increase the health and resilience of the 
urban forest.

EXPAND THE CITY’S NEIGHBORHOOD COOLING  
CENTER PROGRAM 

Develop a comprehensive cooling center program to establish additional location and programming goals 
that prioritize vulnerable populations, consider co-location with other services, ensure transit accessibility, 
incorporate sustainability goals, and encourage development of potential private-public partnerships.

The City provides Angelenos relief 
during a heatwave by extending cooling 
centers hours at public facilities, such 
as community centers and libraries. 
Cooling centers offer Angelenos a cool 
place to stay and access services and 
programs. To ensure that these centers 
are available to those most impacted 
by heat and vulnerable to its negative 
health consequences, the City will 
evaluate the program based on future 

heat projections and a heat vulnerability 
index and will incorporate best practices 
from case studies. Recommendations will 
explore how to expand cooling center 
programming, increase outreach and 
access to facilities, and partner with 
public agencies and private businesses. 
Using new and existing tools, such as 
the City’s real estate asset-management 
system, the City will prioritize activating 
cooling centers based on updated 

criteria—including facility amenities, 
proximity to transit, and other services. 
Cooling centers will also be a priority 
location for applying other resilience 
actions in this strategy, such as combined 
solar and storage projects and community 
cooling strategies. The Emergency 
Management Department (EMD) and 
other departments will work to identify 
public-private partnerships to augment 
existing cooling center opportunities.

  HEALTH DISPARITIES   

Angelenos experience stark disparities 
in terms of health outcomes. Average life 
expectancy varies greatly by geography, 
with the highest at 84.7 years (in Bel Air, 
Brentwood, and the Pacific Palisades) and 
the lowest at 72.8 years (in Watts).43 

These disparities are also pronounced 
when broken down by specific health 
conditions. In 2015, over 30% of adults in 
South Los Angeles reported their health 
to be fair or poor compared with 10% 
in West Los Angeles. The obesity rate in 
South Los Angeles is 34% among adults, 
compared with 23% across Los Angeles 
County.44 Over 30% of children in South 
Los Angeles, Southeast Los Angeles, Boyle 
Heights, and neighborhoods near the Port 
of Los Angeles are obese, compared with 

less than 12% of children in Bel Air–Beverly 
Crest and Brentwood–Pacific Palisades.45 
Food insecurity also varies by community, 
with over 32% of households with incomes 
less than 300% of the federal poverty 
level considered food insecure in both the 
south and east areas of L.A. County. The 
proportion of adults with chronic condi-
tions of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, 
high cholesterol, and current depression 
was higher for each condition among 
those living in food-insecure households.46 

Health is also impacted by crime. Only 
40% of adults in South L.A. reported they 
believe their neighborhood is safe from 
crime compared with over 97% of adults in 
West L.A.47 Average annual homicide rates 
in some higher-income neighborhoods 

were nearly zero, compared with more 
than 20 homicides per 100,000 residents in 
Southeast Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, 
and West Adams–Baldwin Hills–Leimert.48

Disadvantaged communities in L.A. also 
face significantly higher exposures to 
many types of air pollution, which can 
cause a wide array of health effects such 
as adverse birth outcomes; lung function–
development decrements and respiratory 
disease in children; and diabetes, cardio-
vascular disease formation and exacer-
bation, and the potential for cognitive 
decline in older adults. Communities with 
the highest proportion of households that 
are low income are also the most likely to 
have hospitalizations for heat illness on 
extreme heat days.

of potentially dangerous buildings. 

Many low-income neighborhoods 
experience higher levels of environmental 
pollution than more affluent parts of the 
city, and low-income renters are more 
vulnerable to building damages and 
deficiencies that go unrepaired. It is 
critical to continue supporting programs 
that enhance public health, particularly 
those that focus on disadvantaged 
communities. 

The City will work to ensure that all 
Angelenos have access to healthy and 
safe living conditions through programs 
that reduce environmental toxins such 
as lead in homes and encourage the 
expedient repair of potentially dangerous 
buildings. In addition to making homes 
safe from pollutants and hazardous 
conditions, it is vital to ensure that 
buildings and neighborhoods remain 

habitable and safe in a hotter, drier Los 
Angeles. The Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power (LADWP) and the 
Southern California Gas Company (SCG) 
currently fund a variety of incentives to 
make buildings cooler and more energy- 
and water-efficient. It is important to 
ensure that those resources, and new ones 
if needed, are available to all Angelenos.

To contribute to the overall health and preparedness of Angelenos, the City will seek to improve food 
security through expanded partnerships and programs. 

Today, Angelenos with greater access 
to grocery stores and neighborhood 
markets stocked with affordable, healthy 
food are more likely to have healthier 
diets and, in turn, better health. In many 
communities across Los Angeles, less 
than 20% of adults reported eating the 
recommended serving of fresh produce,49 
while over 25% reported eating fast food 
at least once a week.50 In July 2016, the 
Department of Aging (DOA) conducted 
a needs assessment and found that 
one out of three seniors reported being 
food insecure. To increase food security 
for seniors, the department provides 

Congregate Meals at over 100 dining 
centers and Home Delivered Meals for 
homebound seniors, five days a week. 
The City’s Good Food Purchasing Policy 
ensures meals are of high quality, from 
sustainable sources, and locally grown. 

More than 900 small grocers throughout 
Los Angeles are a neighborhood’s only 
or best option for increasing local food 
choice. Community organizations such 
as COMPRA Food, Food Forward, L.A. 
Kitchen, and Everytable are changing 
the food-distribution landscape in L.A. by 
improving access to healthy foods. This 

effort supports the City’s goal to ensure 
every Angeleno lives within half a mile of 
fresh food by 2035. 

The City will work with partners to 
integrate into the program planning for 
food security after a disaster and to 
ensure that policies are being devel-
oped to increase food security today. 
Every neighborhood needs to assess 
the stresses that impact their food 
choices when access to food may be 
severely limited due to disruptions in the 
supply chain, refrigeration, or a steady 
paycheck.

EXPAND MOBILE CITY SERVICES FOR  
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS 

The City will work to increase access to City services—both in high-need locations and through mobile 
programs—in an effort to reduce immediate barriers and improve flexibility in providing services in the face 
of future shocks or major events.

The lack of access to public personal 
hygiene facilities continues to be a signif-
icant barrier for individuals experiencing 
homelessness. To address this need, the 

City has allocated funding to a number of 
initiatives, including expanding operating 
hours at the public restrooms along the 
Venice Beach Boardwalk and Skid Row; 

launching the mobile shower program; 
and developing a shower program at pool 
facilities, specifically targeting individuals 
and families residing in cars.

INCREASE ACCESS TO OPEN SPACE IN  
UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS

The City will work with partners and use a data-driven approach to prioritize resources and expand access 
to open space in underserved neighborhoods. 

Beautiful parks, open spaces, and 
green spaces improve quality of life and 
health outcomes and promote social 
cohesion. Adding more green space to 
communities can also mitigate the effects 
of climate change. Unfortunately, not all 
neighborhoods have the same access 
to open space. Measure A gives us a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ensure 
that investments are prioritized for 
underserved neighborhoods and that they 
achieve multiple benefits. The intent of the 
proposition is to provide funds to benefit 
property and improve the quality of life by 

preserving and protecting parks,  
safe places to play, community recreation 
facilities, beaches, rivers, open spaces, 
water conservation, youth and veteran 
career development, and the urban  
tree canopy.

To accomplish this, the City will 
develop a data-driven strategy to 
prioritize investments in underserved 
neighborhoods. Specifically, the 
Department of Recreation and Parks 
(RAP) is developing an equity-based 
framework to prioritize capital projects 
to improve access to open space. 

This framework will help ensure that 
resources are invested in high-need 
areas. Moreover, the City is committed to 
increasing public access and recreational 
opportunities along the L.A. River by 
supporting projects such as the G2 parcel 
in Taylor Yard, the Central Service Yard 
Master Plan, 6th Street Viaduct Park, 
Albion Park, and Caballero Creek Park. 
The City is also exploring innovative 
partnerships, such as partnering with 
the Los Angeles Unified School District 
(LAUSD), to create Community School 
Parks to increase access to open space.

INCREASE STABILITY THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, JOBS, AND OPEN SPACE IN 
COMMUNITIES ADJACENT TO THE LOS ANGELES RIVER 

The City will partner with communities to cultivate additional tools and policies for land use and economic 
development to improve economic mobility and wellness with high-quality jobs, affordable housing, and 
increased access to open and natural spaces.

The City will work with Los Angeles River 
communities to ensure that revitalization 
efforts create benefits for existing residents 
and businesses while mitigating desta-
bilizing impacts such as displacement. 
The City will also explore new actions to 
protect and promote affordable housing 
by considering options for developments 
on publicly owned land, expanding the 
scope of the River Improvement Overlay 
District, establishing community mitigation 
funds, and piloting new public-private 
partnership programs to deliver affordable 

housing. For example, the City could 
pilot a transfer of development rights 
program along the river to concentrate 
development at residential nodes near 
transit. This would create additional flood 
channel capacity, green infrastructure, 
and open spaces between nodes. As the 
revitalization of the Los Angeles River is 
realized, it is important to ensure that the 
open space, restoration, and connective 
access projects along the corridor aid in 
improving the health, culture, and quality 
of life for river-adjacent neighborhoods. 

 The City will also explore innovative 
financing techniques to help sustain a 
resilient river system.  For instance, the 
L.A. City Council is exploring an Enhanced 
Infrastructure Finance District (EIFD) 
along the river, which would allow for the 
capture and reinvestment of tax-incre-
ment increases in a specified geographic 
area. EIFD funds could be used for 
brownfield acquisition and cleanup, park 
development, affordable housing, and  
job creation.

IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING FOR ALL AGES 
THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN MOBILITY 

By adopting age-friendly policies around mobility, the City will improve the health and well-being of  
all Angelenos. 

From 2010 to 2030, L.A.’s population of 
people over 65 is expected to nearly 
double, from 1.1 million to 2.1 million. The 
City will actively seek to reduce health dis-
parities and improve well-being for every-
one by considering the needs of our aging 
population. By adopting policies and 
programs that promote an age-friendly 
city, we will ensure that mobility improve-
ments benefit our most vulnerable people 
and improve our neighborhoods. 

 

Purposeful Aging Los Angeles seeks to 
prepare the Los Angeles region for a 
rapidly aging population through an 
innovative, sustained initiative that unites 
public and private leadership, resources, 
ideas, and strategies. In May 2016, the City 
of Los Angeles was officially designated as 
an Age-Friendly City by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). The goals of this 
initiative will be data driven and shaped 
by the Department of Aging, the Mayor’s 

Office, and a Citywide Task Force. The Task 
Force will help develop a WHO-required 
needs assessment and strategic plan and 
help ensure specific actions are taken by 
several city departments consistent with 
the directive. Examples of programs that 
promote age-friendly cities include the 
redesign of our streets and sidewalks to 
take into account an aging population. 
These upgrades have resilience value as 
they also benefit everyone in the City.

A resilient city is 
able to bounce 
back when 
faced with 
adversity. 

PLANNING FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW

When key resilience values like adaptability, flexibility, and resource-
fulness are integrated into a local government’s services and systems, 
they improve how the city functions. A well-run and livable Los Angeles 
improves Angelenos’ quality of life both on a daily basis and in times 
of crisis. It strengthens systems, services, and assets to withstand and 
respond to disruption and help all Angelenos thrive in recovery. 

The City of Los Angeles’ resilience-building efforts are driven by the 
need to take the long view and assess the long-term impacts of the 
choices we make today. We aim to address the challenges we have 
inherited from those who came before us and to leave the city better 
than we found it.

Los Angeles prides itself on its size and diversity. This is a city with over 
four million residents, over one million buildings, and 500,000 active 
businesses across neighborhoods that span nearly 500 square miles. 
Providing reliable services on this scale requires vast and complex 
infrastructure, much of which is aging and in need of replacement or 
repair. To create a more resilient city, our government must invest in 
infrastructure projects with the adaptability and flexibility to serve 
Angelenos well into the future. A resilient city looks to the future and 
rebuilds based on lessons learned from the past. It addresses many 
hazards and achieves multiple benefits so that it is prepared to func-
tion and respond in the face of uncertainty and distress.

REQUIRE RESILIENCE AS A GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR LAND 
USE DECISIONS IN THE LOS ANGELES GENERAL PLAN AND 
ZONING CODE UPDATES

The City will incorporate resilience as a guiding principle in planning documents that inform land use and 
development in Los Angeles.

The City is well-positioned to integrate 
resilience into long-range planning for 
multiple initiatives that are already under-
way. These include updating the citywide 
General Plan, which provides the founda-
tion for land-use decisions in the city and 
the Zoning Code. The General Plan should 

incorporate climate adaptation, hazard 
mitigation and recovery, and efforts to 
increase equity and leverage long-range 
capital planning for infrastructure invest-
ment. To promote citywide resilience, the 
City will incorporate a guiding principle 
into the General Plan to encourage 

land-use decisions that improve the ability 
of individuals, neighborhoods, economic 
systems, and the environment to recover 
from disasters, climate change, and 
economic shifts.

MAKE RESILIENCE-BUILDING A PERMANENT PART OF THE 
CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ SYSTEMS AND SERVICES

To continue to adapt in the face of shocks and stresses, Los Angeles will expand the Office of Resilience, 
integrate resilience-building into departmental strategic planning, and measure and track citywide 
resilience metrics.

Expand the Office of Resilience to lead the 
implementation of Resilient Los Angeles 
The Office of Resilience and the Chief 
Resilience Officer will lead the implemen-
tation of Resilient Los Angeles; foster 
partnerships that advance the City’s 
resilience goals; and engage Angelenos 
in resilience-building actions that increase 
their well-being, health, safety, prepared-
ness, and stewardship. As an inaugural 
member of 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), 
Los Angeles is one of more than 24 cities 
and states making resilience-building a 
permanent practice in governance in the 
United States.

Integrate resilience into City department 
strategic plans, policies, and programs 
and by appointing Departmental Chief 
Resilience Officers  
Implementing Resilient Los Angeles will 
require each City department and General 
Manager (GM) to innovate, collaborate, 
and plan. To ensure accountability and 
alignment with Resilient Los Angeles, 
the implementation of actions in this 
strategy will be incorporated into GMs’ 
annual performance reviews and budget 
proposals. Departmental Chief Resilience 
Officers will also be appointed to work in 
collaboration across the city. Furthermore, 
additional interagency working groups and 
taskforces will promote coordination and 
collaboration across agencies to address 
specific shocks and stresses as well as our 

most serious resilience challenges, such as 
those concerning lifelines, seismic safety, 
and critical infrastructure.

Measure and track citywide  
resilience metrics 
Los Angeles is one of the first 100RC 
cities to pilot the City Resilience Index, a 
comprehensive tool that measures a city’s 
resilience in a systematic, globally applica-
ble way. This holistic baseline understand-
ing will allow the City to track resilience 
outcomes, the implementation of Resilient 
Los Angeles, and the institutionalization of 
resilience within City systems and services 
over time. Measuring and tracking these 
outcomes in the long term will allow the 
City to focus on achieving progress toward 
accomplishing resilience goals.

INTEGRATE RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES 
INTO CITY CAPITAL PLANNING

The City will create a framework for coordinating, prioritizing, and evaluating capital 
projects based on resilience and sustainability criteria to align infrastructure investments 
across departments. 

Develop a framework for 
increased collaboration 
in long-range capital 
planning
To limit disruption, save money, and 
ensure that major capital projects make 
L.A. stronger and safer in the face of 
shocks and stresses, the City will design a 
process by 2022 that facilitates long-term 
capital planning across multiple agencies. 
A coordinated, long-term vision is needed 
to leverage new and existing funds to 
achieve multiple benefits for infrastructure 
planning. Recent initiatives, such as 
Mayor Garcetti’s Water Cabinet, the 
Office of Sustainability, Vision Zero, Great 
Streets, and LARiverWorks, have fostered 
increased collaboration in infrastructure 
planning and implementation. A number 
of projects underway exemplify the 
coordinated and resilient approach, 
including the Sixth Street Viaduct, which 
integrates innovative design features 
for open space and connectivity, and 
the planned automated people mover, 

which will link LAX to the region’s public 
transportation network. The City will 
build on these projects as models in 
creating a more coordinated resilient 
planning framework. This work will 
prioritize increased collaboration from the 
project to systemwide scales through a 
comprehensive, facilitated process.

Establish a task force 
to assess critical 
infrastructure and 
prioritize investments
The City’s new Critical Infrastructure Task 
Force will convene key departments to 
assess the lifespan of critical infrastruc-
ture based on risks and vulnerabilities, 
establish reasonable timeframes for facility 
upgrades, and prioritize investments.  
This collaborative interdepartmental effort 
will engage the City’s budgetary process 
in addition to federal, state, and local 
grant opportunities to leverage available 
resources for long-term, citywide 
improvements.

Incorporate multihazard 
risks and vulnerabilities 
into long-term capital 
planning
The City will incorporate climate concerns, 
seismic risk, and other vulnerability con-
siderations into infrastructure projects and 
planning. It will do this by using tools and 
criteria to evaluate multihazard variables 
and analyze interdependencies with other 
systems. Hazards and risk analysis will 
be incorporated into each phase of an 
infrastructure project in the city, includ-
ing planning, design, construction, and 
operations. Identifying both the likelihood 
of failure based on hazards and risks, 
as well as the life-safety and economic 
consequences of each hazard and risk 
and their interdependencies, will inform 
how the project timeline is prioritized. New 
maps will be developed that identify risks 
and vulnerabilities, and prioritized actions 
will be integrated into long-term capital 
planning projects and programs. The City 
will also evaluate and modify engineering

A NEW APPROACH TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE IMPACTS 

One Water L.A. is a collaborative effort 
to develop an integrated framework 
for managing the city’s watersheds, 
water resources, and water facilities in 
an environmentally, economically, and 
socially beneficial manner. One Water 
L.A. used the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s Climate Resilience Evaluation 
and Awareness Tool (CREAT) to identify 
that approximately 50% of the city’s 

stormwater and wastewater infrastructure 
components are vulnerable to various 
climate risks. An additional 10% investment 
in capital costs would help the City to 
avoid 90% of future expenses and costs 
resulting from climate-related impacts. 
This process identified a number of 
recommendations that can be applied  
to infrastructure citywide.

design manuals and criteria as required, 
based on hazard zones, threats, risks, 
and vulnerable infrastructure. This process 
will be informed periodically by experts 
with the most up-to-date climate and 
seismic risk data and trends, who will also 
recommend changes to the City’s design 
criteria for capital planning projects.

Develop innovative 
finance opportunities for 
capital improvements
The City has an opportunity to increase 
funding and coordination of capital 
improvements through innovative 
financing models such as Public, 
Private, Philanthropic Partnerships (P4). 
Additionally, a new Chief Infrastructure 
Finance Officer could develop and 
implement a proactive framework for 
capital improvement financing and 
funding, including coordination of grants, 
bonds, and P4 partnerships. 

Use data and technology 
tools to prioritize 
climate resilience 
policies and practices
The City will integrate tools that inform 
decision-makers of the environmental, 
equity, and economic costs and benefits 
to prioritize investments and influence 
policies and practices. Currently, the City 
is piloting and integrating the following 
analytical and mapping tools into its 
decision-making process: 

Cost-Benefit Analysis Tools 
The City is using a cost-benefit software 
tool, Impact Infrastructure’s Autocase, 
to determine how to maximize potential 
benefits and minimize costs early 
in the infrastructure project design 
process. Autocase uses data from site 
design to provide financial, social, and 
environmental returns on investment 
for each design option. The City of Los 
Angeles Department of Public Works 
(DPW) is piloting this triple-bottom-line 
cost-benefit analysis to evaluate and

rate infrastructure projects to ensure that 
projects improve the environment, public 
health, and quality of life for Angelenos. 
The City can also evaluate projects using 
the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s 
Envision rating system to ensure that 
sustainable practices and designs are 
incorporated. 

The Trust for Public Land’s Climate- 
Smart Cities 
In October 2016, the Trust for Public 
Land (TPL) launched a version of its 
Climate-Smart Cities tool for Los Angeles, 
which uses City data to identify locations 
and strategies for incorporating green 
infrastructure and open space to mitigate 
the effects of climate change. TPL is 
training City staff and partners to use the 
Climate-Smart Cities tool and working with 
the Mayor’s Office to ensure compatibility 
with the City’s GeoHub and Open Data 
portal. The initial five-year partnership 
aims to expand the available data sets 
and train City staff and the public to 
access and use the tool. Geo-coded 
data and maps will allow the City to 
tailor climate-mitigation measures and 
investments by neighborhood.

INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF CITY FACILITIES TO 
REDUCE FLOODING RISK

The City of Los Angeles DPW is moderniz-
ing the Venice Pumping Plant to mitigate 
the risk of a potential sewage spill that 
could result from insufficient capacity to 
manage major flooding events. The DPW 
will construct a new, two-mile-long force 
main sewer to supplement the existing 
force main sewer, which was built in 1960 
and has been in continuous service for the 
past 54 years without any maintenance. 

During severe wet weather, peak flows to 
the Venice Pumping Plant have exceeded 
the capacity of the only existing force 
main sewer, conveying wastewater from 
the plant to the Hyperion Treatment Plant. 
Without additional capacity, there is a 
risk of sewage overflow into city streets 
and surface waters in Venice and the 
surrounding area.

ADOPT EMERGENCY LAND-USE TOOLS TO ADDRESS 
DISPLACEMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT IN ADVANCE OF A 
MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT    

The City will develop a plan for implementing emergency land-use tools that allow for flexible reuse of 
properties severely damaged in a disaster. This framework will shorten the recovery period, while creating 
opportunities to provide community amenities.

Prompt remediation or repurposing of 
properties damaged in a catastrophic 
event will allow Angelenos to recover 
without the additional economic and 
social stresses that often follow prolonged 
disuse of damaged buildings, including 
economic decline, blight, and crime. 

The City will develop a plan to implement 
emergency land-use tools that can be 
used in the wake of a major disaster 
to allow for flexible reuse of private 
properties that have been severely 
damaged. The City will also study how 
tools such as the voluntary transfer of 

development rights would enable the City 
to limit future development in an area 
while replacing any lost development 
rights in other areas that are deemed able 
to accommodate development.

REVITALIZATION EFFORTS 

The City will explore institutionalization, funding, and governance strategies that integrate resilience 
objectives and expedite river revitalization initiatives.

The City will explore the following key insti-
tutionalization, funding, and governance 
strategies to integrate resilience objectives 
into waterway revitalization initiatives:
•  The City Council’s Arts, Parks and 

River Committee has been exploring 
the establishment of an Enhanced 
Infrastructure Finance District 
(EIFD) related to the river to provide 
tax increment financing for river 
revitalization.

•  As proposed by the LARRMP, the City 

will work with partners to establish a 
Joint Powers Authority (JPA), or other 
authority-sharing arrangement to serve 
as the entity with responsibility for 
Los Angeles River restoration, right-
of-way management, maintenance, 
permitting, development, operation, 
and public liability. Establishment 
of a JPA would clarify jurisdictional 
authority and facilitate a collaborative, 
comprehensive approach to river 
revitalization efforts.

•  The JPA, or another public entity, will 

evaluate potential funding sources that 
support resilience objectives along 
the Los Angeles River, including EIFDs, 
which enable local governments to set 
aside and bond against incremental 
property tax revenue for capital 
projects such as affordable housing, 
infrastructure, and open space. 

•  The L.A. River Cooperation Committee 

will explore ways to augment its existing 
evaluation criteria with a resilience lens. 
This committee is the joint City, County, 
and USACE working group that coor-
dinates, evaluates, and recommends 
river-adjacent projects to be approved 
by the City, LACFCD, and USACE. To 
promote resilience objectives, criteria 
will be established to prioritize projects 
that have multiple benefits, encourage 
coordination, and address risks and 
vulnerabilities.    

•  To encourage economic activity along 
the river and bolster economic oppor-
tunity for existing residents, the City will

Long Term

  

explore tax incentives to attract small, 
locally owned businesses to key areas 
along the river. In turn, local residents 
will benefit from the economic activity 
that results from river improvements. 

•  The City will work with other public 

sector entities such as the County, the 
State, and the federal government; 
multiagency groups, such as Metro, 
Metrolink, and the Southern California 
Association of Governments; and other 
stakeholders, such as the California 
High Speed Rail Authority, the Ports 
of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the 
Los Angeles Business Council, and the 
Los Angeles Economic Development 
Corporation. This cooperation will help 
to ensure that multibenefit outcomes 
are achieved in infrastructure projects 
that are built near, at, along, over, 
under, upstream or downstream of the 
Los Angeles River—so that the river 
functions as a central piece of a resilient 
infrastructure system.

DEVELOP NEW CITYWIDE EQUITY INDICATORS TO 
INFORM AND MEASURE INCLUSIVE INVESTMENTS AND 
POLICY-MAKING 

The City will work with partners to develop equity indicators that support the City’s most vulnerable 
populations, and can be measured over time for existing and future resilience initiatives.

Los Angeles’ Health Atlas and other 
City resources have provided high-level 
data illustrating the disparities in health, 
education, life expectancy, and access 
to open space. However, through the 
development of equity indicators, the 
City will better understand and measure 
equity in the city. The equity indicators 

could span housing, justice, services, 
education, health, and the economy. Once 
developed, they will be used by the City 
to support existing and future policies 
and programs that affect disadvantaged 
and undersupported groups—including 
disproportionately underrepresented and 
vulnerable populations such as Angelenos 

experiencing homelessness or linguistic 
isolation, immigrants, youth, seniors, or 
people with disabilities. These indicators 
will also help the City measure equity in 
the budgeting process and demonstrate 
that resources are being invested where 
there is the greatest need.

SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE 
LINGUISTICALLY INCLUSIVE AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT  

In recognition of Los Angeles’ rich cultural and linguistic diversity, the City will develop more robust policies, 
processes, and training to increase inclusiveness in government, especially to our most underrepresented 
and vulnerable populations.

Los Angeles is home to people who come 
from more than 150 countries and speak 
more than 200 languages. The City will 
continue to reduce linguistic isolation by 
encouraging multilingual publications, 

communication and engagement oppor-
tunities. Through additional programs 
and training, the City will also continue 
to foster an environment that recognizes 
and acknowledges our diversity and 

understands that we have diverse values, 
norms, practices, attitudes, and beliefs 
about safety, social capital, and economic 
support systems.

  MEASURING EQUITY

  

In March 2016, the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power (LADWP) 
established the Equity Metrics Data 
Initiative (EMDI) to track, measure, and 
report on how its programs are provided 
to all customers and residents of Los 
Angeles. The EMDI establishes a data-
driven framework that assesses how 
well programs, services, and resources 
are distributed and used throughout the 
city, both geographically and demo-
graphically, to see where any disparities 
may exist. Data collection and analysis 
through the EMDI will provide important 
information about LADWP’s services and 
operations, and it will help ensure that all 
customers are reached with fairness and 
equity. With input from key stakeholders, 
staff identified equity metrics that are 
the most relevant to multiple aspects of 
LADWP’s operations and are also aligned 
with the department’s priorities. There are 
15 equity metrics in four core categories: 
Water & Power Infrastructure Investments, 
Customer Incentive Programs, 
Procurement, and Employment.

  A MULTILINGUAL CITY

  

Los Angeles’ diversity is a source of 
great pride and strength. According 
to “New Americans in Los Angeles,” 
a report released in early 2017, the 
foreign-born population of Los Angeles 
in 2014 was nearly 1.5 million, making 
up 37.8% of the city’s total population.51 
Many Angelenos, including 63% of youth, 
speak a language other than English at 
home.52 The census estimates that 27.7% 
of residents speak English “less than 
very well.”53 Linguistic isolation impacts 
involvement in disaster preparedness 
and recovery, climate mitigation, 
financial security, and education, which 
collectively build resilience. Angelenos 
must be engaged and empowered with 
accessible tools and resources in the 
languages that they speak.

INNOVATE MORE RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS 
BY ADVANCING BUILDING FORWARD L.A.

Continuing the efforts of Building Forward L.A., the City will work with key stakeholders and experts to 
develop recommendations that provide strategies for better facilitating high-design, high-performance 
buildings capable of withstanding multiple hazards and that address goals for sustainability around 
renewable energy, efficiency, and water.

Building Forward L.A. is a participatory 
research and design process launched 
in March 2017 by the Mayor’s Office, 
Rebuild by Design, and core partners 
A+D Museum, the Los Angeles Chapter 
of the American Institute of Architects 
(AIA-LA), the Now Institute, the Structural 
Engineers Association of Southern 
California (SEAOSC), and the Los Angeles 

Chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council 
(USGBC-LA). The Building Forward 
L.A. initiative aims to improve how we 
design and build our city by integrating 
advancements and innovations in design, 
engineering, and construction into more 
sustainable and resilient buildings. Through 
a collaborative process, Building Forward 
L.A. is gathering input from stakeholders 

and experts to help identify and prioritize 
policy, process, and design recommen-
dations. This set of recommendations will 
address L.A.’s unique challenges, including 
threats from shocks such as earthquakes 
and long-term stresses such as drought, 
damaging heat, and flooding, and 
prioritize the efficient and sustainable use 
of resources.

BUSINESSES THROUGH THE L.A. CYBERLAB, OUR 
CYBERSECURITY PLATFORM 

Support and grow the L.A. CyberLab to share actionable cyberthreat indicators and strategic intelligence 
across government agencies and the private sector.

The City will serve as a resource to help 
defend Los Angeles businesses from 
cyberattacks, particularly medium, small 
and startup businesses that lack high-level 
cybersecurity protection or expertise. 
By offering timely threat awareness and 
intelligence, the City will bolster its own 

resilience to cyberthreats and ensure 
the security and continuity of vital 
economic engines. The City will contribute 
to the development of cybersecurity 
professionals through the unique offering 
of cyber warfare simulations focused on 
cyber attacks against major metropolitan 

infrastructure and local businesses.  
These simulations build up the next 
generation of cybersecurity leaders to 
exponentially increase the partnership 
and defense against cyber crime in  
Los Angeles.

PREVENT CRIME AND VIOLENCE THROUGH ENHANCED  
USE OF DATA 

The City will leverage its data processing capabilities to support analysis to reduce crime, similar to its 
successful efforts reducing domestic violence and human trafficking.

Building on past successful methods of 
data analysis around domestic violence 
and human trafficking, the City will engage 
a wide range of collaborative partners 
to develop a scale-up strategy around 
methods to lower crime.

Use Data to Expand Community Policing 
The Los Angeles Police Department 
(LAPD) is committed to the principles 
of community policing and the critical 
importance of continuing to enhance 
transparency and build trust with all 
Angelenos. These efforts have included the 
establishment of a Community Relationship 
Division dedicated to relationship-based 
policing, establishment and expansion 
of the Community Safety Partnership 
(CSP) Program promoting safe living 
environments and positive relationships 
with community members, and countless 
other related efforts. To further this work, 
the LAPD will work to expand City-wide 
surveys of public sentiment, in order 
to build a deeper understanding of 
community concerns, and better target 
resources and efforts to address them.

Use Data to Combat Domestic Violence  
The Los Angeles Police Department 
(LAPD) partners with domestic violence 
service providers on the Domestic Abuse 
Response Teams (DART) program, which 
offers a coordinated response to survivors 
of domestic violence and their children. 
The DART program provides crisis 
intervention and access to safety and 
wraparound support to help Angelenos 
work toward healthy, violence-free lives. 

To further leverage this investment, the City 
is developing a web-based data collection 
pilot that enables LAPD, service providers, 
and other departments to automatically 
monitor cases and track metrics. 

Fight Human Trafficking with Enhanced 
Data and Outreach 
As the level of human trafficking cases 
surged nationwide, the City partnered 
with the federal government to expand its 
human trafficking prevention and victim 
services while also improving training 
for law enforcement. By enhancing data 
collection, the City will anticipate 

challenges, formulate effective policy 
solutions to improve the services available 
to victims, and increase prosecutions 
against perpetrators of human trafficking.

In 2016, Los Angeles became the 
largest city to formalize a partnership 
with the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security’s Blue Campaign, which brings 
together law enforcement, government, 
nongovernment, and private organizations 
to raise public awareness of human 
trafficking. The campaign offers training on 
how to detect and investigate this crime, 
leverages partnerships to educate the 
public on how to recognize and report 
human trafficking, and protects victims by 
bringing suspected traffickers to justice. 
In Los Angeles, partners include the Los 
Angeles World Airport Police, LAPD, Port 
Police, the Los Angeles Fire Department 
(LAFD), the Los Angeles Department of 
Building and Safety (LADBS), and the 
Housing and Community Investment 
Department (HCID).

  CRIME AND VIOLENCE
Communities across America are engaged 
in an important conversation about the 
future of policing and criminal justice, and 
Los Angeles is a leader in that dialogue 
with a forward-looking approach that 
is a model for cities around the world. 
Crime in Los Angeles was at its peak in 
the early 1990s—rising to its highest point 
in 1992. That year the City suffered from 
the highest homicide rates on record. The 
high levels of crime in that time period 
have been attributed to the crack cocaine 
epidemic, and related gang activities.

Today, the City’s crime rate remains near 
historic lows. Overall crime rates are 
declining, and violent crime, including 
homicides, has leveled off. 2016 was  
the eighth safest year in more than 60 
years, with per capita crime levels as low 
as they were in the mid-1950s.

To disrupt cycles of violence, the City will 
continue making targeted investments in 
the people and communities most affected 
by crime. Neighborhood safety, however, 
isn’t just about crime suppression:  

It depends on building relationships 
between communities and officers that 
are based on trust—on both sides of the 
badge. Recent events around the country 
underscore the need for, and importance 
of, lasting collaborative relationships 
between local police and the public. 
These relationships can be built and 
strengthened through community policing, 
which promotes greater trust between law 
enforcement officers and the communities 
they serve.

IMPLEMENT CITYWIDE DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEMS TO 
SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS AND CITY DEPARTMENTS  
IN IDENTIFYING THE MOST URGENT AND HIGHEST  
NEED SITUATIONS 

The City will work with public safety officials and spatial analysts to develop a platform that facilitates 
situational awareness and communications between key City departments and partner agencies.

The City will continue to increase situational awareness through technology integration that will have an immediate impact on the 
City’s preparedness, response, and recovery. The City is working with technology and research partners to pilot and implement 
data integration platforms that help with predictive modeling before a major event and increased situational awareness during  
and after. These efforts help both interdepartmental communications and public messaging so that the City and the public can 
easily access information, data, and maps, such as evacuation areas and available shelters during a major wildfire. 

  

  

  

  

   

 

SALUS — THE CRISIS HUB

SEISMIC CONCERN

  

WIFIRE

The City will work with the Los Angeles 
Homeland Security Advisory Council 
(HSAC) to develop a citywide framework 
using SALUS, a cloud-based crisis, event 
management, and information sharing 
platform. HSAC is partnering with the  
City to provide this public safety 
technology platform that integrates 
private, public, and civic sector data 
into actionable information during times 
of disruption or crisis, enabling rapid, 
data-driven decision-making among first 
responders and public agencies.

The LAFD is working with the University of 
San Diego to use real-time remote sensor 
data to model and visualize wildfires and 
predict a wildfire’s rate of spread using 
weather patterns and other data. WIFIRE 
is an integrated, web-based system with 
a mapping tool that enables what-if 
analysis of fire scenarios in advance and 
in addition to real-time fire forecasting. 
This tool provides information on past 
fires, weather forecasts, and terrain and 
vegetation, which are used for planning 
fire response and management of natural 
resources well ahead of a wildfire.

The City is piloting Seismic Concern, 
a predictive analytics platform that 
simulates earthquake scenarios in 
order to identify potential vulnerabilities 
and deliver reliable damage estimates 
and action planning tools after an 
earthquake. Seismic Concern is a web-
based decision-assistive tool that uses 
realistic simulations rooted in the latest 
technological understanding of seismic 
events to train staff, allowing the City to 
better prioritize resources that get the 
City back up and running as quickly as 
possible following an earthquake. By 
leveraging innovations developed since 
the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the City 
will further modernize emergency services 
in advance of the next catastrophic 
seismic event.

ESTABLISH POST-DISASTER RESTORATION TARGETS FOR 
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

The City will establish performance goals and recovery targets for critical infrastructure, including water, 
sewer, electricity, gas, communications, and transportation systems. 

The Mayor’s Sustainable City pLAn, which 
was released in 2015, recommended the 
development of measurable targets for 
post-disaster recovery. The creation of this 
framework, including recovery perfor-
mance goals, will establish a process to 
assess service restoration that considers 
vulnerable populations and uses, critical 

infrastructure interdependencies and 
supply chains. Performance goals will 
be established for our water, sewer, 
electricity, gas, communications, and 
transportation systems. These targets 
will be incorporated into the City’s 
Continuity of Operations Plans, which 
ensure that City agencies are able to 

continue to perform essential functions. 
The framework will allow for the estab-
lished targets to be revised periodically 
to account for changes in infrastructure, 
technology, systems management, and 
interdependencies.

emergency response, repair, and recovery 
work following a catastrophic incident. 
Through this public-private partnership, 
the City has entered into an agreement 
with two contractors that will provide 
equipment, supplies, services, and labor 
for a wide variety of immediate needs in 
the event of a large-scale disaster.

GOAL 10: PROVIDE SAFE AND 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR  
ALL ANGELENOS

55

DOUBLE THE PACE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION 
AND PRESERVATION AND TRIPLE PRODUCTION OF NEW 
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BY CHANGING REGU-
LATION, ADOPTING NEW FINANCING MECHANISMS, AND 
EXPLORING ADAPTIVE RE-USE OF PUBLICLY-OWNED SITES  

By leveraging new funding sources, streamlining processes, and pursuing policies that encourage 
production and preservation, the City will reach our ambitious goal of 100,000 housing units by 2021.  

A robust, diverse, and resilient housing 
stock is essential to promoting economic 
prosperity and growth in Los Angeles. 
Yet, due to the lack of sufficient affordable 
units and the overall growth of the City’s 
population, L.A. continues to experience 
the affordability crisis that started in the 
mid-1970s. With passage of Measure 
HHH in 2016, the City can issue $1.2 billion 
in housing bonds. This source alone 

increases annual affordable housing funds 
by 263% over the next decade. In 2017, 
Mayor Garcetti signed the affordable 
housing linkage fee into law, which could 
generate up to $100 million annually for 
affordable housing activities. The City will 
also continue to deploy mechanisms to 
expedite the housing permit process, such 
as the priority housing project program. 
Our housing laws include protections for 

renters that exist in city law, which the City 
will continue to promote and enforce. To 
prevent low-income tenants from being 
displaced, several measures have been 
taken to increase the capability of the 
Rent Stabilization Ordinance to investigate 
complaints of illegal rent increases and 
pursue enforcement.

PROMOTE AND EXPAND HOUSING OPTIONS FOR  
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS CHRONICALLY  
HOMELESS AND HOMELESS VETERANS AND VICTIMS  
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING

By expanding supportive and transitional housing options for populations, most in need, the City will reduce 
the unsheltered homeless population while providing health and support services.

The City is committed to developing 
supportive housing as quickly as possible 
to help homeless individuals with special 
needs remain stably housed. Additionally, 
the City will focus on homelessness 
prevention by ensuring housing and 
support services for other high needs 
populations. The LAHSA 2017 Greater  
Los Angeles Homeless Count highlights 
the overlap for many homeless individuals 

having also experienced domestic 
violence (DV) or sex trafficking in their 
lifetimes.54 The L.A. County report found 
that 50% of homeless women have had 
some experience with domestic violence 
and 28% have had some experience with 
sex trafficking during their lifetimes. To 
provide services that directly responds 
to the needs of DV victims experiencing 
homelessness, the City is increasing the 

number of DV shelters and the shelter  
bed capacity, in addition to expanding 
staffing and services that help navigate 
both the shelter experience and the 
transition to permanent housing. The City 
will also look into expanding programs 
focused on human trafficking victims, 
including launching a human trafficking 
pilot shelter program.

INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN CITY AND STATE PROGRAMS 
THAT PROMOTE SAFER HOUSING BY REDUCING  
EARTHQUAKE RISK 

The City will work with partners to encourage voluntary and mandatory participation in seismic  
retrofits to improve the seismic safety of all housing, while ensuring that structural improvements do  
not lead to displacement.

The passage of a historic and robust 
mandatory retrofit policy, led by Mayor 
Garcetti, will strengthen our most vulner-
able soft-story and non-ductile concrete 
buildings to prevent loss of life in the event 
of a major earthquake. These mandatory 
retrofits will need to be completed by 
2024 for soft-story buildings and 2043 for 

non-ductile concrete buildings. However, 
these timeframes are maximums, not 
minimums. Currently hundreds of building 
owners have retrofitted their buildings. In 
order to reach a 100% compliance rate, 
the City will advance our outreach and 
education programs and continue to 
partner to advance financing tools for

building owners and tenants experiencing 
financial hardships.  

Furthermore, while not mandatory, all 
building owners should be aware of the 
seismic retrofit opportunities, like bracing 
and bolting of single-family homes and 
voluntary retrofits for soft-story multi- 
family buildings with fewer than four units.

  EQUITY, HOUSING, AND HOMELESSNESS 

The Los Angeles region is facing a home-
lessness crisis and a shortfall in affordable 
housing. Home prices and rental costs 
in the region have been rising for more 
than 40 years. According to the California 
Housing Partnership Corporation, median 
rent in Los Angeles County has increased 
28% since 2000, while median renter 
household income has declined 8%.55 
Renters comprise 63% of the population 
and spend 47% of their incomes on rent, 
earning a median annual household 
income of $51,538.56 Angelenos affected 
by extreme inequality are most vulnerable 
to the impacts of a major shock. The lack 
of affordable housing creates a financial 
strain that not only limits their financial 
ability to plan for unanticipated events 
and costs, but also impacts funds for 
essentials like food, transportation, and 
healthcare and can require doubling up 
(overcrowding) to share housing costs.57  

The strain on the housing market is one 
factor that contributes to an increasing 
homeless population. According to the 
Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s 
2017 Point in Time count, overall homeless-
ness in the City of Los Angeles increased 
by 20% over the past year to 34,189 

people. In recent years, the homeless 
population has both grown in size and 
become more widespread throughout the 
city. Over 10,600 individuals—nearly one-
third of the total homeless population— 
are chronically homeless.58 In 2016, the 
City and County undertook a historic joint 
effort to address homelessness regionally. 
The City’s Comprehensive Homeless 
Strategy report takes a three-pillar 
approach: house those who are currently 
homeless, prevent residents who have 
homes from falling into homelessness, 
and implement a street-based plan that 
protects public health and public safety 
along with the civil rights of people 
experiencing homelessness.59

In 2016, and again in 2017, more than 
two-thirds of local voters agreed to 
invest in alleviating homelessness. Voters 
overwhelmingly passed two homeless-
ness initiatives to help combat the crisis: 
Measure H will pay for services to help 
lift 45,000 people out of homelessness, 
and Proposition HHH is estimated to 
support construction of up to 10,000 units 
of permanent supportive housing over the 
next decade.

COORDINATE A HOMELESS HOUSING SERVICE PROVIDER 
PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM TO FORTIFY SYSTEMS AND  
SERVICES TO WITHSTAND FUTURE CHALLENGE 

The City will work with service providers and emergency managers to provide emergency preparedness 
resources, trainings, and coordination to support homeless housing shelter services in the wake of a  
major disruption. 

This coordinated effort will focus on 
emergency preparedness resources, 
trainings for staff working at shelters, 

and other opportunities to expand 
communications and planning. It will also 
make physical improvements to support 

emergency housing providers in their 
continued operations.

CONNECT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS  
NEAR THE RIVER WITH BETTER ACCESS TO SERVICES  
AND HOUSING

The City and its partners will continue to engage in targeted outreach to homeless populations along the 
Los Angeles River to better connect them to existing programs and services, such as permanent supportive 
housing and health services.

A substantial number of homeless 
individuals seek shelter in and near the 
Los Angeles River, which exposes them 
to particular weather-related shocks 
and stresses, such as high heat, flash 
flooding, and untreated runoff. Building 
upon existing citywide homeless outreach 
efforts, such as the Homeless Outreach 

and Proactive Engagement (HOPE) 
initiative, the City will engage in targeted 
outreach to the homeless population 
along the Los Angeles River. The City will 
work in partnership with agencies such 
as L.A. County, the USACE, and the Los 
Angeles Homeless Services Authority 
(LAHSA) so that existing services and 

programs can better reach this vulnerable 
population. The City will also develop 
training for dedicated outreach teams 
to comprehensively understand both the 
jurisdictional landscape and the needs of 
the homeless population that are specific 
to the Los Angeles River.

ESTABLISH NEIGHBORHOOD-BASED, SHORT- AND  
LONG-TERM POST-DISASTER HOUSING PLANS

Develop comprehensive plans and partnerships that provide Angelenos with access to short- and long-term 
housing as quickly as possible after a disaster.

The City will develop a community-based, 
long-term post-disaster housing plan to 
minimize housing insecurity for Angelenos 
and to reduce costly planning delays 
following a major disaster. This plan will 
build on best practices identified through 
the Regional Disaster Housing Planning 
Project, a three-year and five-county 
planning project that produced resources 
to support local jurisdictions in developing 
disaster housing plans. The plan will 
augment pre-disaster safety inspections 
and streamline permitting requirements for 
temporary housing solutions and post-
disaster residential repairs. The City, led by 
Recreation and Parks (RAP), will continue 
assessing existing sheltering facilities and 

develop a framework for the temporary 
establishment, use, and management of 
shelters to house displaced individuals 
following catastrophes. 

To ease the transition from shelters to 
short-term or permanent housing, the 
plan will also explore tactics such as 
coordinating with insurance providers to 
help expedite payments to individuals. 
The City will use its Asset Management 
Tool to identify City-owned sites that could 
accommodate temporary, interim, or 
permanent housing. 

The plan will also build upon policies 
and programs developed after previous 

disasters, such as the 1994 Northridge 
earthquake, to protect the rights of 
existing renters and property owners. 
Recent catastrophic events, such as 
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, 
have underscored the need to have 
post-disaster housing and sheltering 
plans in place prior to a major disaster 
to minimize the devastating and costly 
impacts that can result from major shocks, 
such as earthquakes. In particular, the 
post-disaster housing needs of vulnerable 
populations will be a priority of the plan. 
These include homeless individuals, people 
with disabilities; low-income individuals; 
survivors of domestic violence; and 
seniors who may be severely impacted.

GOAL 11: RESTORE, REBUILD, 
AND MODERNIZE LOS ANGELES’ 
INFRASTRUCTURE

  EARTHQUAKES

In Los Angeles, we live with the threat of 
a serious earthquake every day. Most 
Angelenos are familiar with the impact of 
earthquakes, but a deeper understanding 
of what causes them will help people to 
be better prepared and to respond and 
recover when one occurs.

An earthquake is a sudden slip on a fault 
that shakes the ground and radiates 
seismic energy. The duration of the shaking 
directly corresponds to the magnitude of 
the earthquake. The magnitude 6.7 1994 
Northridge earthquake occurred on a 
10-mile long fault, lasted seven seconds, 
and caused strong shaking in about 20% 
of the city.60 Like the 1906 San Francisco 
earthquake, future earthquakes generated 
by the San Andreas Fault are expected  
to be a magnitude 7.8 or higher, last about 
two minutes, and cause the same level  
of strong shaking over thousands of 
square miles.61

Southern California’s breathtaking land-
scape—from Catalina Island to the San 
Gabriel Mountains—was formed by more 
than 300 faults in the region, including the 
San Andreas Fault, located 34 miles north-
east of downtown Los Angeles. Significant 
faults within the City include the Newport-
Inglewood, Santa Monica, Hollywood, 
Puente Hills Blind Thrust, Palos Verdes Hills, 
Verdugo, San Fernando, Northridge, and 
Santa Susana faults. There are more than 
30 known earthquake faults below the City 
of Los Angeles. A medium to major earth-
quake within Los Angeles or the adjacent 
region could have major impacts to health 
and safety, as well as the economy. 

According to Swiss Re, one of the world’s 
largest reinsurance companies, Los 
Angeles faces the fourth greatest risk of 
catastrophic loss resulting from an earth-
quake of any city in the world, behind 
Tokyo, Jakarta, and Manila.62 The USGS 

and the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) analyzed every fault in  
the U.S. and found that Los Angeles 
County alone represented one-quarter of 
the expected losses of the whole country, 
averaging $1.5 billion per year.63

When the big one occurs, with potentially 
hundreds of years of annualized loss 
at once, we will face a catastrophic 
depression of our regional economy. If 
infrastructure comes back into service 
without a long delay, the recovery will be 
quicker and the regional economy may 
return to its expected level within a few 
years. In major earthquakes, however, 
economic activity may not recover for 
several decades, resulting in economic 
catastrophe. Increasing seismic resilience 
will lessen detrimental impacts to health 
and safety and improve the chances that 
the regional economy will bounce back.

61

ADVANCE SEISMIC SAFETY, PRIORITIZING THE MOST  
VULNERABLE BUILDINGS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND SYSTEMS

The City will work with earthquake experts to share and implement best practices across city agencies to 
fortify the built environment and improve the City’s capacity to prepare for and respond to earthquakes.

Re-establish the Mayor’s Seismic Safety 
Task Force 
By re-establishing the Mayor’s Seismic 
Safety Task Force, the City will leverage 
state-of-the art advances in seismic 
resilience to develop and implement 
seismic recommendations, beginning with 
those in the Mayor’s Resilience by Design 
report and the Mayor’s Resilient Los 
Angeles strategy.

Evaluate Seismic Risk of City Assets and 
Management Programs 
The City will expand efforts to incorporate 
seismic risk in asset planning and manage-
ment by learning from LADWP’s seismic 
pilot programs. The LADWP water system 
recently undertook a pilot study to inves-
tigate methodologies for incorporating 
seismic risks into their asset management 
program, which currently assesses infra-
structure quality and recommends facility 
replacements or improvements. Additional 
seismic analysis will strengthen the 
system citywide through prioritized asset 
investments. Other City asset-planning and 
management programs should consider 
similar efforts.

CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN  
OUR BUILDINGS

Explore financing strategies and 
incentives for seismic retrofits of 
privately-owned buildings 
The City will work with partners to explore 
additional funding and financing options for 
residential and commercial seismic retrofits. 
Seismic retrofits, such as the installation 
of earthquake-resistant bracing systems, 
can protect properties from catastrophic 
damage. Because not all building owners 
have the means to afford retrofitting their 
buildings, the City will explore developing 

additional programs for building owners 
subject to mandatory retrofits, as well as 
the expansion of the Earthquake Brace+Bolt 
and CalCAP Seismic Safety Capital Access 
Loan Program and opportunities to 
leverage Property Assessed Clean Energy 
(PACE) financing.

Develop recommendations for mandatory 
retrofits for additional building typologies 
As Los Angeles takes historic steps to 
retrofit our most vulnerable buildings, 
the Mayor’s Seismic Safety Taskforce 
will re-evaluate whether to recommend 
mandatory retrofits for additional building 
typologies that were built using older 
building codes, such as steel buildings 
constructed before 1994.

Develop a mandatory private school 
seismic evaluation program    
The City will develop additional manda-
tory seismic evaluation programs that 
prioritize buildings with private schools 
and daycares that are not held to the 
higher seismic safety standards required 
of public K-12 educational buildings by 
California’s Field Act.

Advance immediate occupancy building 
codes for new buildings 
The City will also work with local, state, 
and federal partners to develop and 
adopt a “public safety” standard for new 
buildings and to advance immediate 
occupancy building codes for new 
buildings that will allow Angelenos to 
reoccupy buildings more quickly following 
an earthquake, minimizing impact on 
safety, housing, and economic activity. 
Under current building codes, it may 
take weeks, months, or longer until 
buildings are able to be used again. These 
disruptions can cause minor to serious

safety and economic consequences, 
which can prolong the immediate effects 
of an earthquake.

FORTIFY OUR WATER SYSTEM

Expand Seismic Resilient Pipe Network 
The City will expand development of 
the seismic resilient pipe network to 
include the myriad geohazards located 
throughout Los Angeles. It will also work to 
improve coordination among the Bureau 
of Engineering, the Bureau of Sanitation, 
Southern California Gas Company, and 
other agencies that own buried pipe net-
works and deal with associated hazards. 
Resilient pipeline planning, design, and 
construction requires the development of 
new informational tools and mapping of 
geohazards that could impact the under-
ground pipe, including seismic activity such 
as ground movement and deformation, 
liquefaction, fault lines, and landslides.

Develop mitigation alternatives for the 
L.A. Aqueduct and Elizabeth Tunnel 
To ensure a safer and more resilient water 
system, the City will conduct studies to 
identify and develop mitigation alternatives 
for the Elizabeth Tunnel to address the 
maximum San Andreas Fault rupture. 
The Los Angeles Aqueduct provides 
approximately one-third of the City’s water 
supply. However, the aqueduct crosses the 
San Andreas Fault in the five-mile-long, 
nine-foot-wide Elizabeth Tunnel, making 
it vulnerable to severe damage and 
complete loss of flow in the event of a large 
fault movement. Mitigation alternatives 
will assess seismic vulnerabilities from San 
Andreas Fault events for the California 
Aqueduct and the Colorado River 
Aqueduct, two other sources of water for 
the City of Los Angeles.

Resilient Los AngelesPrepared and Responsive CityResilient Los AngelesCreate a Seismic Resilient Pipe 
Network 

Enhance Reliable 
Telecommunications 

In progress  

  

      

  
In early 2015, LADWP’s Earthquake 
Resistant Water Pipe pilot program was 
launched near the epicenter of the 
1994 Northridge earthquake. LADWP 
completed five pilots throughout the city, 
installing two miles of earthquake-resistant 
ductile iron pipes (ERDIP) to date. With 
the pilot program complete, LADWP will 
continue to install an additional 14 miles or 
more of ERDIP in the coming three years. 
LADWP is also developing a seismic resil-
ient pipe network program. (See Action 91 
for the next phase of this work.)

Implement a Resilience by Design 
Program at LADWP 

In progress  

  

  

   

  

LADWP has a Resilience Manager working 
full time with partners to implement the 
Water System Seismic Resilience and 
Sustainability Program. LADWP is also 
advancing a power resilience program.

In progress  

      

  

 

In summer 2015, stronger telecom-
munications standards were passed 
and signed into law requiring new cell 
towers to be built to a public safety 
standard, consistent with other critical 
infrastructure. In fall 2015, the City signed 
a memorandum of understanding with 
AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint to 
implement network-sharing capabilities 
during emergencies to help residents 
communicate via data and voice networks.

Advance Earthquake Early 
Warning

In progress  

      

  

In 2015, the City partnered with the U.S. 
Geological Society (USGS), Caltech, 
and the LAUSD to begin implementing 
earthquake early warning (EEW) by 
utilizing the ShakeAlert software in school 
classrooms. In partnership with USGS, the 
Mayor’s Office and some City depart-
ments are currently serving as ShakeAlert 
beta testers and beginning to pilot EEW 
technology. (See Action 90 for the next 
phase of this work.)

Increase Local Water Sources 

In progress  

  

  

   

  

  

Currently, Los Angeles imports 85% of our 
water.64 Local water supply development 
will enable LADWP to reduce reliance on 
imported water and cut purchases from 
MWD, saving Angelenos money. The City 
has pledged to reduce the purchase of 
imported water by 50% by 2025 and to 
increase our local water supply by 50% by 
2035. The City continues to make progress 
on increasing the local water supply by 
capturing more stormwater, stepping 
up water recycling, and recharging and 
cleaning the San Fernando Groundwater 
Basin while expanding advanced water 
treatment in the city.

RESILIENCE BY DESIGN 

Resilience by Design (RBD) is the cornerstone of Los Angeles’ commitment to seismic resilience. Developed 
in 2014 in partnership with seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones and the Mayor’s Seismic Safety Task Force, RBD 
has already had a historic impact on the city’s seismic safety. The recommendations focused on the most 
vulnerable infrastructure by strengthening our buildings, fortifying our water system, and enhancing 
reliable telecommunications. Below is a summary of the recommendations, current status, and next steps.

Assess and Retrofit Pre-1980 
Soft-Story Buildings 

Create a Back to Business 
Program 

In progress  

      

  

In progress  

      

  

In October 2015, Mayor Garcetti signed a 
historic ordinance requiring the city’s most 
vulnerable buildings to be retrofitted. By 
the end of 2017, all 13,500 soft-story build-
ings with four or more residential units will 
have received orders to comply with the 
mandatory retrofits within seven years. The 
first 600 owners have already begun to 
retrofit these buildings, nearly all of which 
are subject to the City’s Rent Stabilization 
Ordinance. The City will continue to work 
with partners to advance the soft-story 
retrofits within the seven-year timeframe.

Assess and Retrofit Pre-1980 
Non-ductile Concrete Buildings 

In progress  

      

  

By the end of 2017, approximately 1,500 
non-ductile concrete buildings began to 
receive orders to comply with mandatory 
retrofits within 25 years, as required by 
the ordinance signed by Mayor Garcetti 
in October 2015. The City will continue to 
work with partners to advance the non-
ductile concrete retrofits within the 25-year 
timeframe. 

Implement a Seismic Safety 
Rating System for City buildings 

In progress  

      

  

The City supports advancements in 
seismic building rating systems and is 
in the preliminary stages of assessing 
City buildings. The City’s new asset 
management program will serve as an 
important tool in the next phase of  
this process.

The LADBS will launch a Back to Business 
Accelerated Seismic Safety Assessment 
Program to coordinate with building 
owners in advance of a major earthquake, 
register high-priority buildings for rapid 
assessment by LADBS, and integrate other 
available resources.

Mandate Retrofit of Buildings 
that are Substantially Damaged 
in Earthquakes

Complete

 

      

  

  

The City Council adopted an ordinance 
requiring buildings that experience 
substantial damage in low levels of 
shaking to be evaluated and retrofitted 
rather than repaired. This new policy 
became effective May 11, 2016.

Develop an Alternative Water 
System For Firefighting 

In progress  

      

  

The LADWP and the LAFD prepared a 
preliminary plan in July 2015 for addressing 
the risk of fire following an earthquake. 
In 2016, research was used to begin 
identifying and mapping secondary 
water resources. This research helped 
to indicate the most vulnerable parts of 
the city. LADWP, LAFD, DPW, EMD, and 
other partners are now developing a 
series of recommendations for short- and 
long-term strategies for increasing 
access to primary and secondary water 
resources after an earthquake. They are 
also mapping ignition and fuel sources 
to help departments prioritize policies, 
programs, and infrastructure investments 
that will mitigate the risk of fire following 
an earthquake.

Fortify the Los Angeles Aqueduct 

In progress  

  

  

  

  

 

In 2015, LADWP developed the Elizabeth 
Tunnel Seismic Risk Reduction Preliminary 
plan that outlines two projects: (1) a risk 
reduction project to increase opportuni-
ties for continued water flow in the event 
of damage to the Elizabeth Tunnel in the 
near-term, and (2) a replacement modifi-
cation project to provide an engineered 
solution to crossing the San Andreas Fault 
to minimize long-term service disruption in 
the event of the anticipated largest offset 
(approximately 40 feet).  

Fortify Other Aqueducts 

In progress  

      

  

LADWP, Metropolitan Water District 
(MWD), and the Department of Water 
Resources (DWR) formed the Seismic 
Resilient Water Supply Task Force in 
2015 in response to recommendations in 
RBD to work together to fortify the four 
aqueducts that bring water to the  
Los Angeles region. The agencies held  
an aqueduct workshop in 2016 to develop 
a five-year action plan. 

Protect Water Storage 

In progress  

  

  

   

  

 

LADWP is ensuring that dams are main-
tained in a safe and reliable manner to 
ensure public safety and a reliable water 
supply in the event of an earthquake. 
As part of this effort, LADWP performs 
regular evaluations of the seismic safety 
of dams and updates of the inundation 
maps used to inform emergency action 
plans for each reservoir.

Resilient Los AngelesResilient Los AngelesPrepared and Responsive CityPrepared and Responsive City  AGING INFRASTRUCTURE 

  

Angelenos rely on a complex and vast 
infrastructure system to deliver critical 
services that make Los Angeles a livable, 
well-run city. The City’s infrastructure is 
aging. Timely repairs and replacements 
are critical, both to prevent existing 
infrastructure from failing and to invest in 
new, modern infrastructure that meets the 
needs of a large and dynamic city.

Proactive investment in replacing, 
repairing, and modernizing the City’s 
aging infrastructure can both save money 
and prevent disruption to people’s lives. 
The Sunset Boulevard water main break 
in 2014 illustrated the impact a major 
break can have on the City, residents, 
and businesses. In the case of major 
water main breaks, LADWP estimates 

that the cost of fixing these breaks after 
the incident can be three times more 
expensive than planned infrastructure 
replacement and repair.65

The scale and age of Los Angeles’ infra-
structure creates a once-in-a-generation 
chance to rebuild and re-envision major 
infrastructure projects to achieve multiple 
resilience goals and maximize benefits. 
With over $50 billion in planned investment 
in City infrastructure over the next decade, 
this investment offers an opportunity to 
take a resilient approach by aligning 
cross-departmental goals and prioritizing 
and addressing risks from multiple 
hazards, including climate and seismic 
vulnerabilities.

EXPAND AND PROTECT WATER SOURCES TO REDUCE 
DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED WATER AND STRENGTHEN THE 
CITY’S LOCAL WATER SUPPLY 

To be resilient in the face of multiyear drought and potential seismic activity, the City must reduce its 
reliance on imported water and meet local water goals by expanding groundwater sources, recycling water, 
and reusing stormwater.

California is currently recovering from one 
of the worst droughts on record. Future 
drought is an ongoing concern for our 
region, and its effects will be exacerbated 
by climate change, which will further 
reduce key sources of freshwater such 
as the Sierra snowpack. Seismic activity 
along the San Andreas Fault further 

threatens our imported water supply, 
which flows through three primary aque-
ducts that transport water to Southern 
California from the Owens Valley, 
Northern California, and the Colorado 
River. Angelenos and the City should 
decrease their demand on imported water 
by reducing overall water consumption 

and expanding local water sources. 
Actions to grow local water supply 
include cleaning up the San Fernando 
Groundwater Basin aquifer, increasing 
the City’s production of recycled water at 
water reclamation facilities, and system-
atically capturing and reusing stormwater 
throughout the city.

  LIVING WITH AND WITHOUT WATER

Between 2012 and 2016, Los Angeles and 
California experienced the most severe 
drought in the last 1,200 years.66 Rising 
temperatures contributed to a reduced 
Sierra snowpack, which provides as much 
as one-third of California’s water supply. 
This loss in water supply resulted in Los 
Angeles importing up to 80% more water 
during the drought.67 68 The warming trend 
and reduced snowpack are projected to 
worsen in future droughts, but the severity 
of their impact will depend on our efforts 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A recent study69 of the warming impacts 
on California’s snowpack during drought 
found the following:
•  In the “snow years” (November–June of 

2011–2012 through 2014–2015), human-
caused zclimate warming reduced 
average Sierra Nevada snowpack  
levels by 25% compared with a climate 
model simulation without human-
caused warming.

•  Using the warming conditions expected 
in 2081–2100 under a business-as-usual 
scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, a 
model simulation of the recent drought 
saw average snowpack was reduced 
by 85% compared with what actually 
occurred in the winters of 2011–2012 
through 2014–2015. Nearly all snow is lost 
at elevations below 8,000 feet.

•  Loss of snow in drought years will be 

made worse by climate change, no 
matter which greenhouse gas emissions 
pathway the world follows.

Additionally, periods of severe drought 
may be followed by extreme precipitation 
events leading to risk of flooding, 
mudslides, and damage to water 
infrastructure. In March 2017, Mayor 
Garcetti declared a state of emergency  
to address unprecedented snowmelt in the 
Owens Valley. After a historic, multiyear 
drought, the state experienced a wet 
winter season that led to record snowpack

241% above normal in the Eastern Sierras. 
In times of extreme precipitation and when 
there is more rain and less snowpack, 
the City and State need to manage 
greater amounts of water earlier in the 
year. Wet years like 2017 are a reminder 
that investments in local water supply 
are crucially important—particularly the 
expansion of spreading grounds, recycled 
water infrastructure, stormwater capture, 
and cleaning our groundwater basins. 
LADWP plans to invest $2.4 billion over the 
next 10 years in water system infrastructure 
improvements, including local water 
supply development projects. Resilient 
water infrastructure will ensure the City is 
prepared to handle both extreme wet and 
extreme dry years.

PRIORITIZE KEY NEIGHBORHOODS FOR  
STORMWATER CAPTURE, URBAN GREENING,  
AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS 

The City will identify neighborhoods that would most benefit from a systematic approach to incorporating 
green stormwater infrastructure solutions into the public right of way and develop a policy for requiring and 
incentivizing implementation in those areas.

The City will identify priority areas to 
incorporate green infrastructure into the 
public right of way to promote benefits 
such as increasing local water supply, 
decreasing pollution from urban runoff, 

and reducing the heat island effect. 
Priority neighborhoods will include 
disadvantaged communities and areas 
susceptible to flooding. Green infrastruc-
ture strategies will vary between simpler 

solutions, such as swales and parkway 
basins, and larger projects, such as 
underground infiltration galleries under 
key streets and alleys, where the water 
supply benefits are greatest.

Resilient Los AngelesResilient Los AngelesPrepared and Responsive CityPrepared and Responsive CityLOS ANGELES RIVER: A NEW WATER WAY

The 51-mile Los Angeles River connects 
many of L.A.’s vibrant neighborhoods 
and serves as the main waterway for 
an 870-square-mile watershed. Since its 
channelization in the 1930s, prompted 
by several damaging flood events in 
its historic floodplain, the river has 
enhanced the resilience of Los Angeles 
and the region by providing engineered 
drainage—able to endure storms and 
move rain water swiftly from the land to 
the sea. However, the same system has 
caused unintentional yet severe negative 
effects to the region’s ecological and 
community resilience, stemming from 
habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, 
and diminished access to open space 
and natural resources for hundreds of 
thousands of people in river corridor 
neighborhoods.

The City—along with other agencies, 
partners, and local residents—has 
recognized the need to revitalize 
the Los Angeles River corridor, as 
detailed in the 2007 Los Angeles River 
Revitalization Master Plan (LARRMP) 
adopted by the City Council, for which 
implementation is steadily underway. 
The ongoing revitalization effort offers 
inherent opportunities to bolster the City’s 
resilience in a number of ways. These 
include greater ecological biodiversity, 
community connectedness along an 
extensive trail and bikeway network, more 
equitable economic development in a 
historically underserved part of the city, 
and engagement and education efforts 
to increase preparedness for the risks that 
are always present along waterways.

RIVER REVITALIZATION TIMELINE
•  The Los Angeles River revitalization 
efforts were launched in earnest in 
the 1990s and will require long-term 
attention and an adaptive strategy to 
see continued success.

•  Revitalization efforts are guided by the 

City’s 2007 LARRMP. 

•  A federally-approved project led by the 

USACE and commonly referred to as 
the ARBOR Study aims to provide 719 
acres of ecological restoration along 
an 11-mile section of the river in coming 
decades. 

•  In early 2017, the City purchased the 

42-acre river-adjacent “Taylor Yard G2” 
parcel in Cypress Park. The parcel is a 
key component in both City and federal 
plans for Los Angeles River restoration 
and is currently slated for habitat, open 
space, and public access.

LEVERAGE FLOOD MITIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO  
ENHANCE LOCAL WATER AVAILABILITY 

Leverage infrastructure investments to maintain flood protection and increase the utility of stormwater 
along the Los Angeles River and throughout the City’s watersheds. 

Flood mitigation techniques have 
evolved dramatically since the bed of 
the Los Angeles River was channelized 
in concrete. Contemporary approaches 
allow for flood mitigation techniques 
to support multiple goals, including 

alleviating drought as a persistent stressor 
and developing additional water storage 
for firefighting following an earthquake. 

In partnership with the USACE and L.A. 
County Flood Control District (LACFCD), 

the City will explore the implementation 
of off-channel or in-channel facilities, such 
as green infrastructure or articulating 
dams along flood channels that can retain 
stormwater for fire fighting, irrigation, or 
even drinking water supply.

PROACTIVELY ADDRESS FLOOD RISK THROUGH POLICY, 
COMMUNICATION, AND INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING 

The City will incorporate revised floodplains and climate projections into decisions regarding infrastructure 
planning, facility design, and development limitations and requirements. 

An expansion of 1% Annual Chance 
Exceedance (ACE) floodplain maps along 
the Los Angeles River in the Atwater 
Village/Elysian Valley vicinity is expected, 
following a certification process with 
the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA). When the maps become 
effective, property owners within the 
1% ACE boundary who have federally-
backed mortgages will be required to 
hold flood insurance. Others may elect 

to purchase flood insurance, given the 
new maps, even if not required to do so. 
Angelenos are eligible for discounted 
insurance because the City participates in 
a floodplain management program and 
planning process that includes community 
education and engagement. The City will 
integrate the new maps into that process 
and continue existing outreach to affected 
property owners. The City will apply 
restrictions to new structures consistent 

with 1% flood zones to limit risk, consider 
the small but present risk of flooding in all 
development and infrastructure planning 
in the area, and consider additional 
actions, informed by climate science and 
future severe weather event projections, 
to assist those impacted by the flood risk, 
including floodproofing design guidelines; 
a floodplain buyback program; or land 
use tools, such as an option for transfer of 
development rights.

  ALISO CANYON DISASTER

  

On October 23, 2015, a massive methane 
leak was discovered at the Aliso Canyon 
underground natural gas storage field 
in the hills north of the Porter Ranch 
neighborhood of Los Angeles. This leak 
became the largest methane leak in U.S. 
history, releasing approximately 100,000 
metric tons of methane over a four-month 
period. The environmental effects of the 
leak are equivalent to driving a million 
cars for one year.70

The Aliso Canyon disaster displaced a 
community for months, caused health 
impacts for many residents, and woke the 
nation to the danger and environmental 

harm of natural gas leaks. The current 
closure of the facility has made the City of 
Los Angeles’ power grid more vulnerable 
to rolling blackouts during periods of 
peak energy use.

In addition to taking immediate response 
and recovery actions, the City began 
planning for a transition to a 100% 
renewable energy supply. LADWP is also 
planning solar and energy storage pilots 
in Porter Ranch to begin moving the 
community closer to the vision of a net-
zero energy neighborhood weaned from 
reliance on harmful fossil fuels.

DEVELOP A CLEAN ENERGY AND SMART GRID 
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS RELIABLE IN THE FACE  
OF FUTURE CLIMATE IMPACTS AND HAZARDS 

The City will collaborate with leading researchers and laboratories to conduct risk and opportunity assess-
ments to support the City’s transition to renewable energy, increased transportation electrification, and 
smart grid infrastructure while maintaining a resilient and reliable grid. 

Over the next 15 years, LADWP will 
transform its power system to support a 
clean energy future, replacing more than 
70% of the existing power supply and 
modernizing much of the aging power 
grid infrastructure.71 These investments in 
clean energy sources, new technologies, 
and infrastructure offer an opportunity to 
integrate and prioritize resilient strategies 
such as integrating renewable energy 

resources and energy storage, expanding 
microgrid activities, and supporting 
demand response programs. Additionally, 
this infrastructure lays the foundation 
for vehicle to grid integration, which 
will allow electric vehicles to become 
load-balancing, emergency energy, and 
resilience assets. The City will pursue 
partnership and research opportunities 
and continue to work with experts to 

assess potential impacts and model 
shocks and stresses, such as a major 
earthquake or heatwave, on the power 
infrastructure. This research will help to 
prioritize infrastructure investments  
and identify solutions for mitigating risks 
and further developing smart, dynamic, 
and clean power infrastructure.

EXPAND COMBINED SOLAR AND ENERGY STORAGE PILOTS   

The Mayor’s Office will work with City departments to identify additional opportunities for municipal solar 
and storage projects, to ensure critical city facilities are accessible and operational in times of emergency, 
and for microgrid projects that expand neighborhood resilience. 

The Mayor’s Office and City departments 
are leading by example and will expand 
current efforts to pilot combined solar 
photovoltaic and energy storage systems. 
This mayoral, multidepartment effort is 
focused on identifying critical facilities 
to use as model for sustainability and 
resilience interventions that can be 
duplicated throughout the city. In testing 
new technologies and energy systems, 
the City will learn from these pilots 
and identify process improvements for 
customers. These improvements will 
encourage easier adoption of on-site 

energy generation and storage, and 
improved resilience when outages or other 
major shocks—such as earthquakes or 
fires—impact the electrical grid. 

By prioritizing pilots at critical facilities 
throughout the city, this action will also 
ensure that first responders have electricity 
and can continue to operate when the grid 
is impacted. For example, fuel pumps at fire 
stations will continue to work during a grid 
outage, ensuring that ambulances and fire 
trucks can continue their work unabated. 
Pilots will also focus on facilities that serve 

constituents, including creating microgrids 
at cooling centers and emergency 
shelters so that in cases of extreme heat 
or emergencies, there are facilities that 
can continue to provide relief from the 
heat and undisrupted shelter services. 
Pilots will consider additional resilience 
and sustainability strategies such as solar 
carports for shading and EV charging. 
The City will also pursue pilot projects in 
vulnerable neighborhoods to demonstrate 
the value and potential of the technologies 
at the neighborhood scale.

EXPAND ELECTRIC FLEETS, CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE, 
AND ENERGY BACKUP TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND 
SUPPORT EMERGENCY AND RESPONSE SERVICES

The City will continue to invest in expanding the City’s electric vehicle (EV) fleet, electric buses, and  
charging infrastructure and will identify opportunities to co-locate energy resilience projects (such as  
solar photovoltaic systems, storage, and microgrid) for backup power and to charge EVs.

The City is committed to expanding EV 
fleets, electric buses and goods movement, 
and charging infrastructure as part of a 
broader effort to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. As a result of these efforts, LAPD 
now leases 200 EVs and have installed 
charging stations at 10 facilities to date, with 
the remaining 14 underway, the Los Angeles 
Department of Transportation (LADOT) 
started running four electric DASH buses 
and recently won a grant to purchase 
more, and the City launched the BlueLA 

EV car share program to serve portions 
of Westlake, Pico-Union, Koreatown, Echo 
Park, and Downtown Los Angeles. These 
investments also build resilience so that 
after a disruption, the City can continue 
to operate buses and draw from vehicle 
batteries as additional mobile power 
sources. Expanding access to EV car share 
programs also increases mobility options. 

As City departments continue to expand 
their EV fleets, the City will explore 

new technologies and opportunities to 
include critical response vehicles in this 
sustainability initiative. The Mayor’s Office 
with LADOT is currently partnering with 
Metro and Foothill Transit to develop a 
downtown electric bus charging depot 
that could eventually include battery 
backup. The City will build on these 
efforts and continue to seek opportunities 
to co-locate EV fleets and charging 
infrastructure with renewable energy  
and power backup.

  PILOTING SOLAR 

  

ENERGY AND STORAGE

As a pilot project, the LADWP is installing 
both solar and battery power sources at 
a fire station located in the community 
of Porter Ranch to offset some of the 
consumption. In the case of a grid outage, 
the battery and solar system will be able 
to keep critical equipment at the facility 
operational. This innovative model could 
help deploy resilient solar power and 
storage for emergency situations, while 
helping the utility with grid reliability and 
integrating behind-the-meter storage at 
the same time.

LEVERAGE AIRPORT MODERNIZATION AT LOS ANGELES 
WORLD AIRPORTS TO INCREASE RESILIENCE

The City will continue to develop infrastructure projects that ”futurize“ our critical infrastructure while 
achieving our sustainability and resilience goals.

Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) is 
the City department that oversees Los 
Angeles International Airport (LAX) and 
Van Nuys Airport. LAX is the fourth busiest 
airport in the world, second in the nation, 
with more than 80 million passengers 
passing through the airport in 2016.72 While 
modernizing airport infrastructure, LAWA 
has the opportunity to also incorporate 
both sustainability and resilience measures 
that will lead by example and benefit 
travelers, workers, and the region.  

The airport directly supports 620,610 jobs 
in Southern California and will indirectly 
support 40,000 more through its $14 billion 
LAX Modernization Project, the largest 
public works project in the City’s history.73 
The project has already modernized LAX’s 
Central Utility Plant, saving around $7 
million in yearly energy costs and reducing 
carbon dioxide emissions by 4,890 tons—
equivalent to taking 1,000 cars off the road. 
The facility was designed to Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) 
Gold standards and will employ cool roof 
and cool pavement technology to offset 

the urban heat island effect.74 Building 
on this success, LAX recently started 
construction on another sustainable 
project, the Midfield Satellite Concourse, 
which will provide 12 new gates. The 
project is designed to achieve LEED Silver 
and CAL Green Tier 1 certifications and will 
also utilize cool roof and cool pavement 
technologies. In 2010, the landmark LAX 
Theme Building was successfully seismically 
retrofitted with a tuned mass damper, 
which will protect the building from 
earthquakes while also preserving the 
iconic arched architecture.75

IDENTIFY, ANALYZE, AND MITIGATE LOCAL OIL AND GAS 
INFRASTRUCTURE RISKS

Integrate local oil and gas infrastructure data into citywide vulnerability and risk assessments to prioritize 
collaborative mitigation actions and investments.

To maintain healthy and safe communi-
ties, anticipate potential hazards from 
legacy oil and gas infrastructure, and 
protect local oil and gas infrastructure, 
the City needs to better understand how 
vulnerable these systems are, as well 
as how potential infrastructure failure 
could impact surrounding communities. 
The City’s Petroleum Administrator will 
work with technical partners to develop 

a framework to assess the vulnerability 
of the City’s infrastructure systems by 
evaluating potential methane gas leaks 
from existing old and abandoned oil and 
gas wells and petroleum pipelines, as 
well as the impact of an earthquake, or 
extreme weather event on oil infrastruc-
ture. Rather than relying on separate 
infrastructure assessments, the City can 
use the framework to assess the system 

comprehensively and make more holistic 
recommendations for upgrades. The 
framework will focus on communities 
affected by multiple challenges, including 
homelessness, poverty, naturally occurring 
methane gas, aged housing stock, and 
public health issues. This framework will 
enable the City to prioritize infrastructure 
upgrades and secure funding to address 
these vulnerabilities.

  OIL RUNS DEEP IN LA

The first modern oil well was drilled 
in Los Angeles in 1892. By the 1920s, 
oil production from the L.A. region 
accounted for nearly 20% of the world’s 
oil production. Today, the Los Angeles 
basin still remains one of the highest 
concentrations of crude oil in the world.76

Approximately 23 oil fields lie beneath 
the city boundaries. The fields are either 
active oil and gas producers, abandoned, 
or used for natural gas storage. There 
are more than 5,100 oil wells in the City 
that are active, idle, buried, orphaned, 
or abandoned. The fields and wells could 
create potential methane leak points or 
become sources of toxic air emissions, oil 
spills, or fire hazards.

In addition, a large network of 
underground utility pipelines under the 
streets and sidewalks of Los Angeles 
carries crude oil, natural gas, diesel, 
jet fuel, water, steam, and electricity. In 
the event of a large-scale emergency, 

these pipelines could rupture and create 
additional leaks, spills, or subsidence—
when land sinks or caves in—and become 
potential fuel for fires or chemical 
contaminants in waterways or storm drains.

Los Angeles has approximately five 
refineries within city limits that are 
susceptible to fire hazards, explosions, 
toxic chemical releases, petroleum 
product spills into the stormwater 
system, and other threats in an extreme 
emergency or regional disaster.

Regionally, there are four other large 
petroleum refineries, multiple marine oil 
terminals at the Ports of Los Angeles and 
Long Beach, offshore oil drilling islands, 
and utility pipeline networks adjacent 
to the City of Los Angeles. While this oil 
and gas infrastructure is outside city 
boundaries it could have a substantial 
impact to Los Angeles residents in the 
event of large-scale catastrophe.

ENHANCE PROTECTION OF CRITICAL DIGITAL ASSETS  
FROM CYBERATTACKS  

The City will develop detailed mapping of digital assets deemed critical to essential functions and 
operations to ensure resilience in the face of a severe cyberattack.

City departments are working to inventory 
their digital assets, especially those 
deemed critical to the department’s 
mission and essential functions or to the 
privacy of City employees or residents. 
Network activities related to such assets 

are assigned higher importance and 
monitored closely to better protect them 
against a cyberattack. Additionally, 
departmental IT Disaster Recovery 
Plans will be developed and tested 
to ensure business continuity during 

a disaster, even in the absence of key 
technologies. Additional ongoing work 
includes integrating physical locations 
of critical digital assets with emergency 
management mapping tools.

SETTING THE COURSE

As the largest city in the nation’s most populous state, Los Angeles 
has long been a leader in advancing innovation, technology, and 
forward-thinking policies. This pioneering spirit can be traced to the 
City’s partnerships with research institutions, businesses, community 
leaders, and public agencies. In looking beyond our city boundaries, 
we constantly seek to leverage our investments, collaborate meaning-
fully, and learn with and from others.

In partnership with leading universities and labs—including world-class 
academics, scientists, and researchers—the City uses cutting-edge 
science and data to inform planning and decision-support processes. 
Given Los Angeles’ size and infrastructure, the City encourages and 
supports sustainable and resilient marketplaces to grow through 
purchasing power, broader citywide policies, and partnerships.

Los Angeles boasts extraordinary diversity in its people, neighbor-
hoods, and natural habitats. This diversity attracts both private and 
public partners to pioneer new pilots, technologies, and programs to 
meet challenges, reach for opportunities, and serve as a model for 
other cities around the world. As part of the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) 
Network, Los Angeles is collaborating with global resilience leaders 
and helping to set a course for the emerging resilience field.

ENSURE CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION  
PLANNING IS ROBUST AND CONSISTENT WITH THE  
PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT

The City will collaborate with regional, state, national, and international partners, including the 100RC Network, 
C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, and Climate Mayors, to develop technical assistance and coordination 
programs and policies that advance climate resilience consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement.

Climate change is creating hazards such 
as extreme heat, drought, severe weather, 
and coastal flooding that pose significant 
environmental, social, and economic 
risks for cities across the globe. The City 
of Los Angeles is committed to being a 
global leader in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions and contributing to efforts to 
limit the rise in global temperatures. The 
City is developing a roadmap for climate 
action planning consistent with the Paris 

Climate Agreement and has set targets to 
reduce emissions 45% below 1990 levels 
by 2025 and 80% by 2050. The reduction 
of emissions is essential in preventing 
additional climate impacts in Los Angeles 
and building climate resilience both 
locally and globally. The City will work 
with experts to develop a climate risk and 
vulnerability assessment to help inform 
which people, places, and systems will be 
impacted by climate change. To mitigate 

these hazards and protect residents, it is 
crucial to engage partners on building 
the knowledge, skills, and governance 
and finance structures for effective 
climate resilience planning. The City will 
also coordinate actions and policies with 
state-level leaders and other cities in the 
Southern California region to ensure we 
are building upon one another’s priorities 
and successes.

TRANSITION TO ZERO-EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY AT THE 
PORT OF L.A. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS, IMPROVE AIR 
QUALITY, AND BUILD DISASTER RESILIENCE 

Leverage clean air investments and energy innovation at the Port of L.A. to improve air quality, achieve 
significant emission reductions, and address energy vulnerabilities.  

The Port of Los Angeles is an important 
national and economic asset. It is the 
entry point for 41% of cargo entering the 
West Coast and indirectly supports one in 
13 jobs in Los Angeles.77 Although the Port 
of Los Angeles is an industry leader in air 
pollution reductions, it remains a regional 
source of air pollution and greenhouse 
gas emissions. To address these emissions, 
San Pedro Bay Ports adopted ambitious 
new targets in an updated Clean Air 
Action Plan in November 2017. This plan 

outlines the ramp-up of near-zero and 
zero-emissions standards for trucks, in 
order to meet a goal of a 100% zero-
emission truck fleet by 2035.

The Port is investing in projects and 
partnerships that will both reduce 
emissions and increase on-site energy 
resilience through combined generation, 
storage, and backup capabilities. For 
example, in partnership with Pasha 
and the California Air Resources Board 

(CARB), the port launched the Green Omni 
Terminal Demonstration project in 2016.  
At full build out, the terminal will be the first 
in the world to generate all of its energy 
needs from renewables. It will utilize zero- 
or near zero-emission equipment, capture 
and treat ship exhaust, and feature its own 
solar microgrid, backed up by battery 
storage and an energy management 
system to allow the terminal to operate off 
the grid during system outages.78

THE PORT OF L.A. LEADS IN AIR QUALITY ACTION

In November 2017, the ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach unanimously 
approved the Clean Air Action Plan 
(CAAP) Update, setting the course for 
eliminating harmful air emissions from 
port-related sources. The 2017 CAAP 
builds off of the clean air achievements of 
the 2006 plan and set outs measures to 
reduce greenhouse gases from port-
related sources to 40% below 1990 levels 
by 2030 and 80% below 1990 levels by 
2050. To reduce emissions, the ports will 
advance the Clean Trucks Program to 
phase out older trucks and transition to 
near-zero emissions in the early years and 

zero-emission trucks by 2035. The 2017 
CAAP includes new strategies to plan for 
and develop the infrastructure necessary 
for near-zero and zero-emissions goods 
movement. The ports will require terminal 
operators to purchase zero- emissions 
equipment if feasible, or near-zero or 
cleanest available when procuring new 
equipment. These efforts will protect 
public health and improve air quality with 
targets to reduce the population-weighted 
residential cancer risk of Port-related DPM 
emissions by 85% by 2020 and to reduce 
port-related emissions by 59% for NOx, 
93% for SOx, and 77% for DPM by 2023.79

TRANSITION TO FOSSIL-FUEL-FREE STREETS TO FIGHT AIR 
POLLUTION AND HELP TACKLE THE GLOBAL THREAT OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE 

The City is committed to the C40 Fossil-Fuel-Free Streets Declaration to purchase only zero-emissions buses 
by 2025 and eliminate emissions in one major area by 2030. 

In October 2017, Mayor Garcetti joined 
mayors from around the world in commit-
ting to new policies that will make cities 
greener, healthier, and more prosperous 
by signing the C40 Fossil-Fuel-Free Streets 
Declaration. The City is committed to 
purchasing only zero-emission buses by 
2025 and to eliminating emissions in a 
designated area by 2030. These policies 

build on Los Angeles’ leadership and 
efforts to implement zero emissions 
technology, including building one of 
the largest municipal electric vehicle 
(EV) fleets in America and launching the 
first EV carshare program designed for 
disadvantaged communities. To further 
improve regional air quality, L.A. Metro 
and LADOT have set targets to fully 

electrify their bus fleets by 2030. The 
City’s numerous different fleets are all 
piloting and actively pursuing medium and 
heavy duty electric vehicle opportunities, 
including a recent pilot of an EV trash 
truck, electric utility bucket trucks, and 
a procurement opportunity for electric 
buses to be used on the airfield at LAX.

INCORPORATE SEA LEVEL RISE MODELING INTO  
LOCAL PLANS 

The City will work with stakeholders and regional partners to incorporate leading science, modeling, and 
policy guidance into planning efforts in neighborhoods impacted by projected sea level rise. 

Incorporating the best available coastal 
climate and tsunami science in coastal 
planning and land use policy development 
will make Los Angeles more resilient to 
the impacts of future events. The City will 
work with its own agencies, the Regional 
AdaptLA program, the U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS), and regional stakeholders 
to assess its socio-economic, physical, 
economic, and ecosystem-focused 

vulnerabilities. Understanding current 
and future vulnerabilities will help inform 
planning policy through Local Coastal 
Programs (LCP), General Plan updates, 
Hazard Mitigation Plans, Capital 
Improvement Planning, and strategic land 
use policy updates ranging from managed 
retreat to transfer of development rights. 
The City will ensure that its plans and 
policies are consistent with the state 

guidance documents and flexible enough 
to accommodate guidance updates and 
ever-evolving and improving scientific 
knowledge. As a first step, the City will 
develop a model LCP with the Venice 
neighborhood that incorporates both 
resilience strategies and the best available 
science. This model will be replicated for 
other coastal areas in the city.

  COASTAL HAZARDS  

Los Angeles will experience accelerated 
SEA LEVEL RISE of one to two feet 
over the next 30 years and six feet or 
more by the end of the century.80 This 
increase will impact coastal infrastructure, 
ports, and beaches, leading to flooding 
during high tides, increased coastal 
erosion, potential for landslides, and 
saltwater contamination of freshwater 
sources. In addition to physical vulnerabil-
ities, many coastal communities also face 
socioeconomic challenges. For example, 
the low-lying communities around the Port 
of Los Angeles are vulnerable because 
of lower per capita income and linguistic 

isolation, while communities like Venice are 
vulnerable because of older housing stock 
and the high percentage of renters. These 
impacts will have consequences for both 
residents and the economy. As climate 
change increases the likelihood of  
coastal impacts like severe storms, higher 
sea levels will increase the severity of  
such events.

While not related to climate change, 
TSUNAMIS can cause rapid coastal 
impacts on a catastrophic scale. Tsunamis 
are a series of waves caused by an 
earthquake event. The majority of the City 

of Los Angeles’ tsunami inundation zone 
is densely populated, with nearly 20,000 
residents and just under 10,000 jobs.81 The 
tsunami risk disproportionately impacts 
low-lying areas of southern Los Angeles, 
but boats, coastal marinas, beaches, and 
container and vehicle cargo systems such 
as the Port of Los Angeles are also at risk 
during an event. While a tsunami would 
impact a small percentage of the city, the 
amount of potential damage to residents, 
businesses, and the coastal beaches in the 
inundation zone is significant. Estimates 
for the cost of tsunami damage to Los 
Angeles have approached $8 billion.82

IMPLEMENT STORMWATER PROJECTS THAT REDUCE 
POLLUTION AND CAPTURE LOCAL WATER SUPPLY

The City will work with L.A. County and regional partners to implement multibenefit water resilience projects 
identified in the City’s Enhanced Watershed Management Programs that capture and reuse stormwater.

The City, County, and other municipalities 
recognize that the long-term impacts of 
climate change will permanently affect 
our region’s water reliability and that 
stormwater capture, infiltration, and reuse 
are important solutions. Municipalities 

throughout L.A. County collaborated 
to develop enhanced watershed 
management programs that prioritize 
multibenefit regional projects to reduce 
pollution and produce local water supply. 
Now, the City will partner with regional 

entities to implement those solutions in  
our primary watersheds, including the  
Los Angeles River, Ballona Creek, and the 
Santa Monica Bay.

DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO SUSTAIN THE REGION’S 
BIODIVERSITY AND TREE HEALTH TO SUPPORT LONG-TERM 
ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE

The City is working with an expert council of scientists to develop biodiversity tools and metrics and 
establish realistic targets meeting resilience goals.

Biodiversity is an important factor in 
building ecological resilience. When 
multiple species serve similar functions 
or a diverse gene pool exists within a 
species, it increases the likelihood that an 
ecosystem will be able to recover from 
environmental shocks and stressors. By 
addressing threats to biodiversity, we can 
build systems that are better adapted 
to the demands of climate change and 

can continue to perform their ecological 
functions in the face of various disrup-
tions. The Mayor’s expert council for 
biodiversity will advise City departments 
on recommendations to incorporate 
biodiversity enhancements into citywide 
policies and practices. Early steps will 
include the development of tools and 
metrics to evaluate existing biological 
resources and set realistic targets. Data 

and expertise from local partners such as 
the Los Angeles County Natural History 
Museum and The Nature Conservancy 
will play an important role in establishing 
the City’s goals. These partners will also 
serve as a nexus for community engage-
ment and participation. The council will 
assist the City in meeting the Sustainable 
City pLAn outcome of developing a 
Biodiversity Strategy.

A GREATER L.A.: CLIMATE ACTION FRAMEWORK

A Greater L.A.: Climate Action Framework 
presents an overview of the key issues 
related to climate change facing the Los 
Angeles region, both to reduce green-
house gas emissions and to adapt to the 
likely impacts of climate change, creating 
a more resilient region. Developed by the 
Los Angeles Regional Collaborative for 
Climate Action and Sustainability (LARC), 
a cross-sectional network of climate 
practitioners and decision makers, the 
document maximizes regional benefits 
while helping California achieve its 
ambitious target of reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 

2030. The document synthesizes the mass 
of information on climate change science, 
mandated state policies, and priority 
actions in a clear and concise way so that 
local practitioners can make wise choices 
and investments appropriate for their 
communities. The Framework addresses 
resilience in the following areas: Energy, 
Transportation and Land Use, Ocean 
and Coastal Resources, Water, and Public 
Health. In addition, it contains a guide-
book to regional climate science impacts 
for local government practitioners and a 
summary of relevant policy mandates.

WHY BIODIVERSITY?

Biodiversity is the variety of life in a habitat 
or ecosystem and is important at the 
genetic, species, and community levels. 
While all ecosystems contain a degree of 
biodiversity, some are “richer” than others. 
Regions that are naturally rich in biodiver-
sity but have lost a significant amount are 
called “biodiversity hotspots.” Los Angeles 
is situated in the California Floristic 
Province, one of 36 global biodiversity 
hotspots. Due to California’s naturally 
dynamic climate and variable topography, 
our diverse body of plants, animals, and 
other living organisms is relatively well-
adapted to the climate shifts expected 
as a result of global warming. However, 
California’s biodiversity is also threatened 
by anthropogenic factors such as habitat 
destruction, an increased frequency of 
fires and landslides, and the introduction 
of opportunistic invasive species.

GOAL 13: FOSTER A HEALTHY  
AND CONNECTED LOS ANGELES 
RIVER SYSTEM

79

REVITALIZE, ENHANCE, AND PROTECT THE LOS ANGELES 
RIVER WATERSHED’S ECOSYSTEM AND BIODIVERSITY

Improve soil and water quality, repurpose brownfields, and restore native habitat along the Los Angeles River 
to benefit regional, human, plant, and animal health.

Los Angeles exists in a rare Mediterranean-
type climate zone. Such zones cover just 
2% of Earth’s land area but support 20% 
of all known plant species.83 The continued 
improvement of the Los Angeles River’s 
ecological health and biodiversity will 
provide region-wide benefits and could 
potentially strengthen the ecological and 
human health of the entire southwestern 
United States. Given this extensive 
influence, the City and its partners will 
continue complex and ongoing efforts to 
re-establish the river’s freshwater marsh 

and aquatic habitats—further protecting 
and improving the river’s ecosystem and 
biodiversity by establishing open space in 
the river corridor, in some cases by land 
conversion and acquisition. The river can 
serve as a model for urban ecological 
revitalization, driven by participation 
from the City’s strong scientific research 
institutions and drawing from international

Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) 2016 
Los Angeles River Ecosystem Restoration 
Feasibility Project (authorized by Congress 
in December 2016) both call for restoration 
of habitat and ecosystem function in 
and along the Los Angeles River, which 
has been degraded by urbanization and 
channelization. These outcomes will also 
be achieved by creating additional open 
spaces in the Los Angeles River corridor, 
to be populated with native habitat to the 
maximum practical extent.

IDENTIFY STRATEGIES TO REDUCE POLLUTION IN THE  
LOS ANGELES RIVER SYSTEM 

Improve the Los Angeles River’s water quality to help protect watershed-scale biodiversity and thereby 
promote the health of local ecosystems.

The Los Angeles River was channelized 
with concrete in the late 1930s and 
continues to be significantly impacted by 
polluted urban runoff year-round. These 
conditions negatively impact the river’s 
water quality and the flora and fauna 

native to this ecosystem. The City is working 
with stakeholders to identify strategies to 
protect and enhance the biodiversity of the 
region. These strategies will likely include 
stormwater capture, stream and tributary 
protection, increased tree canopy, restored 

native vegetation and riparian habitat, 
removal of invasive species, and habitat 
improvements for birds and mammals. In 
addition, stormwater capture strategies are 
in the planning phase and will benefit the 
river ecosystem.

PROVIDE EDUCATION PROGRAMMING TO MAINTAIN A 
HEALTHY WATERSHED AND KEEP ANGELENOS SAFE 

The City and nonprofit organizations will build on existing educational programs focused on connecting 
people with the Los Angeles River and will engage communities by asking for their input on biodiversity, 
health and recreation, and Los Angeles River stewardship.

The City will partner with local 
organizations to promote opportunities 
for the community to learn about the  
Los Angeles River system and resilience. 
These efforts include: 
•  Expanding a wayfinding program to 
further enhance visitor connections to 
the Los Angeles River and demonstrate 
the value of revitalization projects to  
all visitors. 

•  Building awareness of river and flooding 

risk and the ways in which individuals 
can better prepare and respond to such 
risk. The City will partner with organiza-
tions to establish a flood-risk education 

program for neighborhoods adjacent 
to the river. This program will include 
both in-person trainings and an online 
training module, providing residents in 
flood-prone areas with the information 
they need to be better prepared for a 
flood event. Broader safety messaging 
will also raise awareness for visitors and 
residents around general river safety. 
•  Using art to draw a wider audience to 
the Los Angeles River and enhance its 
role as a center for community engage-
ment. The City will work with partners 
to identify physical opportunities to 
incorporate art along the river, as 

recommended in the Los Angeles River 
Revitalization Master Plan (LARRMP), 
and to bring greater attention to risks 
faced by surrounding communities. 
•  The City will partner with agencies 

such as the Mountains Recreation and 
Conservation Authority and Los Angeles 
Conservation Corps to continue the 
seasonal Recreation Zone program and 
expand the River Rangers and River 
Ambassadors programs, which provide 
critical in-person public education 
opportunities within river-adjacent 
communities.

LEVERAGE THE LARIVERWAY FOR EMERGENCY ACCESS 
AND EVACUATION ROUTES TO INCREASE CITYWIDE 
PREPAREDNESS AND DISASTER RESPONSE CAPACITY 

Through LARiverWay projects, the City will enhance connectivity along and across the river to bolster the 
safety of communities during both blue-sky days and times of disaster. 

A revitalized Los Angeles River will play 
a critical role in facilitating disaster 
preparedness and response across Los 
Angeles. Building upon recommendations 

in the LARRMP, the City will continue to 
build out LARiverWay projects, including 
safe, grade-separated crossings and 
pedestrian connections to surrounding 

neighborhoods, which can serve as 
important evacuation routes.

  CREATING AN 

  

LARIVERWAY

The recommendations to create a 
continuous LARiverWay bike path and 
greenway and improve neighborhood 
connections to the Los Angeles River are 
identified in the LARRMP. Multiple bike 
and trail projects have already been 
completed and more are in progress. 
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority (Metro) is 
planning an LARiverWay bike path 
segment through Downtown L.A. to 
complete an eight-mile gap and connect 
two major existing bike paths, which will 
allow continuous travel from Griffith Park 
to Long Beach. On top of that, the City is 
leading LARiverWay design in the Valley, 
which includes 12 miles of bikeway gaps 
and 23 intersection crossings that will 
lead to a continuous LARiverWay from 
the San Fernando Valley to Griffith Park, 
Downtown L.A., and Long Beach. Local 
funding through Measure M is in place to 
complete all LARiverWay gaps in the city.

COLLABORATE WITH CALIFORNIA CITIES TO ADVANCE 
REGIONAL SEISMIC SAFETY

The City will share knowledge and research with other California cities that are mandating retrofits for 
seismically vulnerable buildings and infrastructure in the region. 

The 2016 Safer Cities Survey identifies 
vulnerable building types based on 
previous seismic events and identifies 
regional jurisdictions that are taking action 
to implement mandatory and voluntary 

retrofit programs for the most vulnerable 
buildings. As additional cities in Southern 
California join Los Angeles in mandating 
retrofitting for seismically vulnerable 
buildings and investing in more resilient 

infrastructure, these efforts will be shared 
with others and the total impact of these 
collective actions evaluated for the region.

EXPLORE “PRECOVERY” FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES  
IN COLLABORATION WITH REGIONAL, STATE, AND  
FEDERAL PARTNERS

The City and its partners will explore funding mechanisms that will support investments made before a 
disaster in order to reduce recovery costs following the event.

After every major disaster, the City makes 
significant investments in recovery.  
But “precovery” investments, made before 
a disaster strikes, could produce much 
greater benefits. For every dollar invested 
in advance, a minimum of four dollars 
can be saved for when communities 

need it most. At the 2016 U.N. Habitat III 
Conference, the World Bank asserted  
that “over the next 15 years, annual 
investments of US$6 billion in appropriate 
disaster risk management strategies 
could generate total risk reduction 
benefits of US$360 billion.” The City 

will work with local, regional, and state 
partners to develop multiple funding 
pathways to achieve greater resilience. 
One such pathway could involve devel-
oping a Statewide Seismic Resilience 
Bond Measure to help fortify our critical 
infrastructure.

ENCOURAGE INCREASED ACCESS TO EMERGENCY  
POWER FOR CRITICAL SERVICES

The City will partner with local and state agencies and officials, along with utility providers, to explore 
incentives to increase back up power for critical services. 

Emergency backup power for critical 
services like gas stations, food businesses, 
hospitals, or shelters, is key to ensuring 
the health and well-being of communities 
during an emergency. The City plans to 
work alongside local and state agencies 
and officials, and utility providers, to 
explore and advance the creation of 

government incentives that will encourage 
critical services to maintain backup power. 
Other states, including Florida, Louisiana, 
and New York, have implemented such 
programs for backup power for gas 
stations in response to major natural 
disasters, and this assessment will greatly 
inform next steps for an increasingly 

timely and effective response to a similar 
emergency in California. Programs and 
policies would also need to be aligned 
with interdependent lifeline services, 
including water availability and fire 
prevention strategies.

FORTIFY CRITICAL LIFELINE INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
SUPPLY CHAINS THROUGH CONTINUED ASSESSMENTS, 
COORDINATION, AND INVESTMENT 

The City will continue to work with county, state, and federal partners to identify risks and solutions that 
ensure continued flow of essential goods and services into the region following an emergency, through our 
ports, airports, and highway corridors such as the Cajon pass.

Los Angeles relies on an interdependent 
network of ports, airports, and highway 
corridors to provide essential goods 
and services. If these supply chains and 
critical lifeline infrastructures experience 
an interruption following a disaster, the 
region’s health, safety, and economy 
could be at risk in a matter of days.  
The City will continue to work with 
county, state, and federal governments—
in partnership with the private 

sector—to better analyze the risks and 
interdependencies associated with 
water, electricity, fuel, medical goods, 
pharmaceuticals, transportation lifelines, 
and supply chains. Partners will work 
collaboratively to find interdisciplinary 
solutions to fortify each lifeline and 
supply chain and address their 
interdependencies. Existing efforts include 
the Southern California Critical Lifelines 
Workgroup (SCCLW) and critical supply 

chain resilience studies conducted by the 
Emergency Management Department 
(EMD). The City will also develop stronger 
collaborative relationships with key 
public- and private-sector supply chain 
providers. This collaboration will help 
advance research priorities, develop 
policies and programs that address the 
greatest needs and potential gaps,  
and create training exercises that assess 
and address vulnerabilities.

COORDINATE AMONG TRANSIT AGENCIES TO ADVANCE 
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT RESILIENCE

The City will partner with key transit agencies to facilitate the exchange of data and information to 
coordinate and prioritize transportation and transit investments to develop a robust system, capable  
of withstanding shocks and stresses.

During and after a disaster, it is critical 
that our regional transportation and 
transit operators maintain or quickly 
restore service. The Mayor’s Office 
will collaborate with the Los Angeles 
Department of Transportation 
(LADOT), the California Department 
of Transportation (Caltrans), and the 
Los Angeles County Metropolitan 

Transportation Authority (Metro) to 
facilitate the exchange of data and 
information to coordinate resilience-
building transit investments. This shared 
information will draw from existing efforts, 
including Metro’s “Resiliency Indicator 
Framework,” Caltrans’ “Resiliency Score,” 
and the City’s “Mobility Plan 2035,” which 
was guided in part by LADOT. These 

efforts establish indicators and metrics to 
evaluate the capacity of transportation 
infrastructure to withstand the effects 
of shocks and stresses. By linking these 
efforts and ensuring that the findings  
of each are mutually accessible, the City 
will promote effective prioritization of 
resilience-building transit investments.

WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPROVE 
COMMUNITY HEALTH AND WELLNESS

The City will expand coordination with hospitals, public health organizations, and health providers to 
address health disparities, prepare for disasters, and increase community wellness.

Local hospital networks and public health 
organizations are critical partners that 
promote community health and wellness 
every day and are also critical partners 
during emergencies and catastrophic 
events. The City will leverage existing 
networks of healthcare organizations, 
clinics, hospitals, and agencies to  
fortify critical health infrastructure  
and leverage new and existing 
partnerships to advance community 
health and wellbeing. 

LAFD NURSE PRACTITIONER 
RESPONSE UNIT (NPRU):

In January 2016, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department (LAFD) launched a Nurse 
Practitioner Response Unit—a converted 
ambulance with modern point-of-care 
testing and patient referral capabilities, 
operated by an experienced nurse 
practitioner and a firefighter/paramedic 
with public health training. Nurse 
practitioners have a broader scope of 
practice, as well as training in health 
promotion and recognizing social 
determinants of health. They can also 

function autonomously and treat and 
release patients on the scene. NPRUs are 
currently treating and releasing on-scene 
patients at a rate of 55%.

NPRU Goals and Objectives 
•  Decrease unnecessary ambulance 

transports, thereby increasing 
ambulance availability.

•  Reduce Emergency Department 

overcrowding.

•  Emphasize primary and preventative 

care and empower patients to self-
actuate and thrive.

EXPAND CLIMATE AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS 
THROUGHOUT OUR LOCAL FOOD SYSTEM

The City will work with the Los Angeles Food Policy Council (LAFPC) to identify opportunities to increase the 
resilience of the City’s food network for all communities.

A major shock can cause a disruption to 
food access and distribution. The potential 
for disruption is greater for communities 
that are already food insecure, or have 
limited access to nearby grocery stores 
or healthy neighborhood markets. The 
less access to food that a community 
has today, the more vulnerable it will be 
following a disaster. 

In January 2017, the Initiative for a 
Competitive Inner City released  
The Resilience of America’s Urban Food 
Systems: Evidence from Five Cities with 
support from the Rockefeller Foundation. 
According to this report, Los Angeles’ food 
distribution system faces considerable 
vulnerability. Compared with national and 
regional chains, smaller grocery stores and 
neighborhood markets may face longer 
periods of closure after a major event. 
Communities with fewer retail food options 
are more vulnerable and face a higher risk 
of negative impacts to the food supply 
chain in the wake of a major disaster.

To address these risks, build food security, 
and invest in the local food economy 
and system, the City will work closely 
with the LAFPC to explore partnership 
opportunities and support initiatives that 
meet the following objectives:
•  Expand food access and choices in 
communities that are food insecure.

•  Expand urban farms and community 

gardens, as these spaces contribute to 
local food production, urban greening 
and cooling, stormwater capture, and 
social cohesion.

•  Promote the local Good Food 

movement, championed by LAFPC, and 
consider using the City’s procurement 
and purchasing opportunities to support 
and grow the local food economy. 
•  Encourage companies to reduce  

food waste and increase food access 
by partnering with local communities 
and nonprofits to donate excess  
food products.

SHOCKS/STRESSES

TIMEFRAME

  

  

Medium Term

  

The City will also support local food 
businesses in developing resilience plans 
through the following actions: 
•  Partner with researchers to further 

study food resilience in Los Angeles by 
developing case studies, identifying 
additional key distribution and retail 
vulnerabilities, and highlighting 
opportunities to build and sustain  
food resilience.

•  Provide training, educational 

resources, and technical assistance 
to neighborhood and corner stores 
and create plans to ensure continued 
operations during and after a disaster.

•  Encourage and prioritize resilient 

building improvements, from seismic 
retrofits to backup power, for food 
distribution suppliers in Los Angeles.

•  Identify opportunities to increase 

capacity for distribution points, such as 
food banks, schools, and hospitals, to 
serve larger numbers of people after  
a disaster.

LAUNCH AN EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM 

By the end of 2018, the City will deploy earthquake early warning technologies that will provide Angelenos 
with advance warning of earthquakes through smartphones, desktops, and other notification systems.

In partnership with the USGS, the City 
is developing a ShakeAlert portal, a 
technology developer program, and pilot 
programs that will integrate earthquake  
early warning technology into City systems. 

This will allow the City to communicate 
quickly and directly to Angelenos through 
smartphones, desktops, and notification 
systems such as public address systems. 
Los Angeles has the highest concentration 

of earthquake early warning sensors in the 
country, making the City an ideal site for 
pilot programs and attracting state and 
federal partners that continue to invest in 
the West Coast system as a whole.

FURTHER THE MARKETPLACE FOR  
SEISMIC-RESILIENT PIPES

The City will continue to develop standards and specifications that enhance the innovation surrounding 
seismically resilient pipes, to support LADWP in developing a citywide seismically resilient underground 
water supply.

Current standards and specifications for 
underground water pipes lack specific 
seismic design specifications. As a result, 
the city’s entire water supply is at risk in 
the event of an earthquake. Prompted by 
seismic-resilient pipe pilot programs at 
the Los Angeles Department of Water and 

Power (LADWP), the City is pursuing an 
effort to develop standard specifications 
for water pipelines to ensure that they 
are able to withstand seismic-induced 
forces. Consistent design and construction 
procedures will help ensure that Angelenos 
maintain access to the city’s water supply, 

even in the event of an earthquake. 
These specifications will also encourage 
manufacturers to innovate and create new 
products for the marketplace, resulting  
in greater competition and reduced cost 
to achieve water-system resilience.

L.A.’s Cybersecurity Innovation Incubator 
is a simulated network built into the City’s 
existing cybersecurity operations center 
that will train City analysts, private-sector 
analysts, and local university students 

to rapidly detect and eliminate cyber 
intrusions. This virtual laboratory will 
simulate institutional attacks and allow 
multiple technology firms to gain intelligence 
and showcase their technologies. By 

combining resources from the City, the 
private sector, and local universities, the 
lab will help train the next generation of 
cybersecurity professionals and develop 
innovative defenses to future attacks.
