As  Mayor,  I  am  proud  to  present  El  Paso’s  resilience 
strategy.  This  document  is  the  product  of  three  years 
of  research,  analysis  and  dynamic  stakeholder  input. 
It  is  reflective  of  the  strengths  inherent  within  our 
community,  as  well  as  responsive  to  the  challenges  we 
face in the 21st century. The approaches delineated here 
are  built  upon  a  strong  foundation  of  best  practices 
learned  from  experience  as  one  of  the  first  of  the  100 

Resilient Cities in the world, as well as from our long history as a strong binational 
metroplex – at the border of 3 states and 2 countries. Our city is appreciative of the 
opportunity  presented  to  us  by  the  100  Resilient  Cities  program,  pioneered  by  the 
Rockefeller Foundation. We would like to acknowledge the tremendous support and 
encouragement we have received from the 100RC team, and the network of what is 
now a full 100 cities globally. 

As  our  community  grapples  with  many  challenges,  the  City  of  El  Paso  continues 
to press forward. Building prosperity for our people, and sustainability for our city, 
with  innovative  and  collaborative  solutions.  In  order  to  achieve  that  kind  of  future, 
regardless of any barrier or challenge in our path, our actions must move beyond our 
ability to survive and reach toward our capacity to thrive. 

As you read this document, I hope that you gain a sense of the potential that exists 
within this community. So many El Pasoans have participated in the strategy building 
process. That participation has been invaluable and has only reaffirmed that the people 
of El Paso remain our greatest community asset. Together we will move toward the 
goals of Resilient El Paso.

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I want to 

congratulate the City of El Paso on the release of “Resilient 

El Paso,” the city’s Resilience Strategy, a major milestone 

for the city and 100RC’s partnership with it.   

A  quintessential  frontier  town,  El  Paso  is  a  modern 

binational  city  with  over  350  years  of  continuous 

settlement.  The  city’s  stark  geography  is  both  beautiful 

and harsh, a desert environment with a fragile ecosystem that must support a growing 

population and the pressures of the border.  As cities increasingly face uncertainties 

around water, the threat of rising temperatures, and rapid urbanization, El Paso can 

serve  as  a  model  to  others  in  its  experience  thriving  in  the  desert,  living  within  its 

means, and using its unique resources.

 Resilient El Paso builds on the city’s strengths and provides new approaches to address 

these interrelated challenges. Several of its initiatives address environmental challenges 

while also integrating social considerations, such as the revitalization and repurposing 

of Cohen Stadium, which will catalyze future development in northeast El Paso. It also 

focuses on implementing Civic Design Labs that will engage with the community and 

relevant stakeholders to maximize resilience value as the city undertakes major capital 

projects, policy initiatives and strategy planning updates.  Through actions and goals 

like these, Resilient El Paso sets forth mechanisms for concrete change that will benefit 

all who live there. 

Already  we  have  seen  the  impact  of  our  collaboration  –  the  city’s  Strategic  Plan 

incorporates  many  of  initiatives  developed  by  the  city’s  resilience  team.  With  this 

document, El Paso becomes even better poised to achieve all of its priorities. 

The support of Mayor Dee Margo and City Manager Tommy Gonzalez, along with former 

Mayor Oscar Leeser, was critical to this Strategy, as was the hard work and dedication 

of Nicole Ferrini, who led El Paso’s resilience work throughout the development of this 

Strategy.

While the release of this Strategy marks an important achievement, the work is far from 

over. It will require continued effort and unwavering commitment to realize the vision 

outlined in these pages. We are excited to continue our partnership with the city and 

to watch and participate in the work as it unfolds.

As  El  Paso  approaches  the  culmination  of  more  than 
two  years  of  engagement  with  100  Resilient  Cities,  we 
are proud to announce the release of El Paso’s inaugural 
Resilience Strategy. This work is the result of a citywide 
effort  to  strengthen  our  built  environment,  adapt  our 
governance and economy, and prepare our communities 
for whatever weather extremes or social challenges may 
confront us in the future.

As part of the El Paso Resilience Strategy, four goals key to moving forward have 
been set:

•  Sustainable and adaptive city infrastructure systems, both public and private.
•  Creation of innovative pathways toward economic prosperity for all El Pasoans.
•  Empowering El Pasoans to move our community forward and strengthen our city.
•  Enabling a collaborative and reflective government, responsive to the needs of the 

community and engaged as a global leader.

Each goal contains a series of defined strategies and even more detailed actions that 
function as a road map for the future of our city. In order to guide the execution of 
the Strategy, the City of El Paso has embedded its spirit and specific projects into our 
new  “20  in  2020”  visionary  initiatives.  The  resilience  process  furthermore  expands 
upon successes resulting from El Paso’s 2008 Livable City Sustainability Plan as well 
as  our  award-winning  Comprehensive  Plan.  Throughout  the  development  of  the 
Resilience  Strategy,  the  City  worked  across  departments  and  agencies  to  ensure 
alignment with the El Paso Strategic Plan, and to build a resilience lens into all eight 
of its strategic goals.

Membership in the 100 Resilient Cities Network has pushed us to look beyond the 
daily  concerns  caused  by  environmental  challenges  in  a  desert  ecosystem,  and 
toward a holistic vision of long-term prosperity and quality of life. The City of El Paso 
is anxious to move forward with our resilience journey, and is committed to sharing 
best practices among all 100 of our sister cities in across this innovative network.

Resilience  is  about  a  community’s  ability  to  respond  
positively to change.   Change occurs  as transformational 
shifts  at  environmental,  economic,  and  societal  levels. 
A  smart,  sustainable  approach  to  solutions  addressing 
those  shifts  can  propel  a  community  toward  a  positive 
future.   El Paso’s ability to be resilient lies in the strength 
of  our  culture,  our  capacity  for  public  engagement  and 
the  positive  manner  in  which  we  choose  to  shape  our 
own future.  As a native El Pasoan, I am keenly aware of 
the inherent strength of our community as well as the often overwhelming challenges 
we face.   It has been that awareness, alongside my love for El Paso, that has inspired 
me to take on the challenge of building urban resilience for our beautiful city. 

Over the last three years l have placed all of my personal and professional energy 
into an ongoing effort to understand how to create a more resilient and sustainable 
El  Paso.  I  have  studied  our  city  in  depth,  her  shape,  her  movement,  her  culture, 
her people and found that the city is in itself an agent of change.   To change the 
environment  in  which  a  child  is  educated    is  to  change  her  learning  potential;  to 
change her learning potential is to elevate her opportunity for success.   To increase 
connectivity, communication capacity and access to services and resources changes 
a community’s ability not only to respond to crisis, but its ability to thrive, growing 
toward a positive future. The goal should not be to simply achieve sustainability, but 
to flourish well beyond immediate necessity toward long term prosperity and quality 
of life.  

As El Pasoans, we wear the ability to bounce back in the face of adversity like a badge 
of  honor.    It’s  in  our  history,  inherent  in  our  many  cultures  and  now  it  represents 
our future, a path toward prosperity and a high quality of life standard.   The stakes 
are too high to proceed with business as usual.  It is time for us to come together, 
each taking personal responsibility for the shape of things to come. Here are a few 
thoughts on how we begin:

Forge a collaborative path forward and lead by example.  

The path forward is challenging.  The next steps will emerge out of an all-inclusive 
platform  of  empowered  stakeholders  not  a  small  group  of  individual  interests.  
Gathering  ideas  that  align  with  our  own  preconceived  notions  is  easy.  Embracing 
alternative  viewpoints  and  incorporating  them  into  a  common  goal  presents  the 
challenge. 

A successful resilience strategy for El Paso will depend on community.  The paradigm 
shift of the new millennium dictates that successful policy be initiated from the grass

roots level up, not the other way around. In order to build community capacity and reach 
critical mass, the plan will have to catalyze local non-profits, professional trade organizations, 
faith based initiatives, social justice groups, regional business and others alongside policy 
makers and leaders. 

Acknowledge  the  complexity  of  the  challenge,  leverage  the  maximum  variety  of 
resources and question everything.  

The notion of widespread engagement is larger than simply gathering ideas from a variety 
of  groups.    The  concept  of  resilience  is  reflected  in  many  facets:  economics,  politics, 
security, health, wellness, education, technology, climate, the built environment and most of 
all human behavior.  The real trick is to recognize that none of these exist in isolation. Their 
inherent and universal connection presents both the challenge and the opportunity.  The 
challenge is in overcoming barriers between disparate concepts and ideas.  The opportunity 
lies  in  our  ability  to  leverage  the  strength  of  those  disparate  groups  and  the  knowledge 
of  a  thousand  different  fields  of  expertise.    Forging  a  path  toward  success  also  means 
challenging assumptions, questioning standards and pushing limits. El Paso must be unafraid 
to challenge old assumptions, looking beyond the model for immediate gratification toward 
an aggressive yet pragmatic plan for the future.  

Establish  accountability  metrics  and  a  system  of  supportive  governance  ensuring  a 
legacy of resilience beyond the initial movement.  

Measuring  the  results  of  plan  implementation  is  as  important  as  the  plan  itself.  Locally, 
we have seen an excess of plans emerge and fade without significant impact.  Real time 
accountability focused on systemic feedback will allow our strategy to flex when necessary, 
to  be  resilient  within  itself.    Critical  metrics  for  a  legacy  of  resilience  will  include  shifting 
economic development indicators, educational opportunities, access to services, population 
based behavioral changes and capacity for safe failure. How we choose to respond to this 
data will determine the future resilience and prosperity of our community. 

This report is more than an assembly of information.  It is a roadmap to our resilient future.  
It is a challenge to all El Pasoans; the future is what we make it, let’s start building it together!

It’s time to hit the ground running El Paso!

Recognizing vulnerability in ourselves is difficult. However, 

understanding  our  own  challenges  is  the  first  step  toward 

building strength.  Over the last three years, the city resilience 

team  has  taken  a  deep  dive  into  the  areas  where  our 

community can do better. The story that follows illustrates 

the  emergence  a  different  approach  to  the  challenges  we 

face as a city.

A FOUNDATION FOR RESILIENCE

EL PASO, TEXAS

THE 100RC OPPORTUNITY FOR EL PASO
100  Resilient  Cities—Pioneered  by  The  Rockefeller  Foundation  (100RC)  is  dedicated  to 

helping cities around the world become more resilient to the physical, social and economic 

challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century.

100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just 

the shocks—earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.—but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of 

a city on a day to day or cyclical basis.
12

100  Resilient  Cities  aims  to  catalyze  a  global  movement  of  resilience  beyond  it’s  100 

member  cities.    El  Paso  has  been  given  the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  that  worldwide 

vision.  However, in order for us to stand, shoulder to shoulder, with our sister cities on the 

global stage, it is first necessary for us to understand  ourselves.  The El Paso context is 

unique in the world.  The following resilience strategy is an exploration of that uniqueness 

and the potential that it offers.  

13

There  are  two  major  challenges  inherent  in  cities  that  CRO’s  pioneering  this  work 
face:

•  First, cities are complex systems made of an array of smaller, distinct actors like 
government agencies, local businesses, and offices of international organizations; 
and they often don’t communicate or interact with one another as much as they 
should;

•  Second, the solutions cities develop are often not treated as scalable knowledge. 
Cities regularly solve problems that already have been addressed by other cities, 
when  instead  they  could  be  modifying  solutions  and  lessons  learned,  tailoring 
them to be more effective and cost-efficient.

The  Chief  Resilience  Officer  is  the  centerpiece  of  100RC’s  vision  for  helping  cities 
deal  with  both  of  these  challenges,  while  empowering  them  to  develop  improved 
urban resilience. 

Over the past two years the City of El Paso, led by the CRO, has focused on: 

•  Working  across  government  departments  to  help  El  Paso  improve  internal 
communications,  and  to  address 
facilitating 
communication that reaches across sometimes-significant internal divisions, the 
CRO promotes new collaboration, makes sure that offices aren’t wasting resources 
doing duplicative work, and promotes synergy between the various projects and 
the plans that agencies are drafting.

its  own  complexities.  By 

•  Bringing together a wide array of stakeholders to explore our city’s challenges 
and  help  build  support  for  individual  initiatives,  and  for  resilience  building  in 
general.  These  stakeholders  include  government  officials,  and  it  is  critical  that 
representatives  from  the  private  sector,  non-profits,  and  civil  society  are  also 
included.

•  Leading  the  development  of  a  core  resilience  strategy  intended  to  identify  El 
Paso’s  critical  challenges,  opportunities  and  capabilities,  identifying  the  gaps 
between them. 

•  Over the course of that work, the CRO brings the resilience lens to city problem-
solving  so  that  resources  are  leveraged  holistically  and  projects  planned 
for synergy.  This  lets  the  city  get  the  most  “bang  for  its  buck”  on  its  projects, 
potentially achieving multiple resilience goals with one project. 

This document is a significant benchmark in the execution of this work.  It will present 
a series of resilience-building initiatives, designed for El Paso, that in partnership with 
local stakeholders in addition to assistance from 100RC and our platform partners 
will pave the way toward a stronger, healthier and more prosperous future for our 
community.

In December of 2014, El Paso joined leading cities around 

the world in hiring its first Chief Resilience Officer (CRO).  

The  CRO  is  an  innovative  position  in  city  government 

that  reports  directly  to  the  city’s  chief  executive  and 

acts  as  the  city’s  point  person  for  resilience  building, 

coordinating across all of the city’s resilience efforts.

Today,  the  City  of  El  Paso  has  now  permanently 

incorporated  the  role  of  the  Chief  Resilience  Officer 

within  it’s  organizational  structure.    Beginning  with  the 

completion of this strategy, the Chief Resilience Officer 

will  charged  with  stewardship  of  resilience  practice  as 

part  of  El  Paso’s  future  strategic  planning  as  well  as  in 

regular municipal operations.  

15

Following the hire of the Chief Resilience Officer, the City of 

El Paso’s Resilience Team was established as a mechanism 

to lead the integration of resilience across the organization.  

The introduction of resilience thinking in the context of city 

strategic  planning  allowed  an  opportunity  for  integration 

across  mutiple  areas  of  concern  such  as  economic 

development,  city  planning,  community  development 

and municipal operations just to name a few.   

The Resilience Team in close partnership with departmental 

leadership and the City Performance Office has worked to 

set  the  standard  for  embedding  resilience  thinking  into 

city  strategic  planning  as  well  as  to  institutionalize  and 

operationalize  resilience  practice  across  the  municipal 

organization.  

16

The Strategic Planning Process (SPP) sets the tone and direction of service delivery 

by aligning core business processes and resource allocation with desired community 

results through eight identified goals. The budget process integrates these efforts by 

utilizing the same goal framework as the foundation to support key focus areas and 

fund established community priorities. 

Goal  teams  are  a  core  element  of  this  effort  and  consist  of  representation  from 

every  department  at  various  levels.  This  ensures  cross-functional  collaboration  as 

goal  teams  identify  and  produce  measurable  outcomes  while  pursuing  strategic 

opportunities  spanning  over  a  one-year  (short-term)  and  three-five  year  (longer-

term) planning horizon. To promote a culture of innovation and enable agility, the 

Executive Leadership Team has empowered goal teams to bring recommendations 

on change initiatives at every corner of the SPP.

Strategies,  actions  and  tasks  are  developed  in  alignment  with  the  eight  strategic 

goals  established.  Performance  measures  and  key  performance  indicators  with 

annual  targets  are  determined  to  ensure  continuity  and  accountability.  Industry 

benchmarks and other comparative data sources are used to determine competitive 

performance, with modifications made as necessary to allow for organizational agility 

and alignment during development and deployment.

In  February  2017,  the  Mayor  and  City  Council  gathered  for  a  strategic  planning 

session where they reviewed accomplishments of the Strategic Plan and approved 

the addition of the “20 in 2020” visionary initiatives. Key strategic opportunities at 

the organizational scale are encapsulated in the “20 in 2020” visionary initiatives. As 

a key outcome of this session, resilience strategies were formally and unanimously 

adopted and integrated into the strategic plan to ensure focus on action.  

Opportunities for community input are embedded in each step of the SPP. Strategies, 

actions and tasks are dependent on community input through various mechanisms 

such as customer survey feedback, public comment during Council meetings, budget 

hearings, focus group meetings, community meetings and Town Hall presentations. 

Additionally, focus group discussions with key strategic partners are held to further 

enable a community dialogue.

Goal  team  presentations  are  provided  as  public  meetings  and  posted  online  to 

highlight progress, openly share updates on critical performance measures and as an 

additional feedback opportunity.

Resilience Strategy Development follows a two phase process.  This document marks the 

culmination of two years of intensive engagement, research and planning.  It is intended to 

provide a roadmap of actions that have the ability to make El Paso stronger, more adaptable 

and able to reach our full potential.  

EXTRAORDINARY ENGAGEMENT...
Immediately following the Strategy Process Launch, the City of El Paso initiated a rigorous 

approach  to  stakeholder  engagement.  Starting  with  outreach  to  community  leaders 

identified  during  the  initial  launch  was  pivotal  to  completing  the  appropriate  outreach  in 

a relatively short period of time, allowing the City of El Paso to catalyze external networks 

and resources. Key supporters during this early phase included Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo, the 

Hospitals of Providence, The Paso Del Norte Health Foundation, The University of Texas at 

El Paso, Eco El Paso, the El Paso 911 District, the El Paso City County Office of Emergency 

Management  alongside  Regional  Emergency  Management  partners  and  the  Borderplex 

Alliance. 

20

ASSESSING PERCEPTIONS...
In addition to formal stakeholder input sessions, the City of El Paso engaged in constant 

one-on-one meetings with individuals interested in building community resilience. Well over 

1000 hours has been spent creating resonance around resilience in the context of our city...

for our people.  

Formal  stakeholder  engagement,  dubbed  Resilience  Roundtables,  were  convened  from 

May  to  June  2015.    Eleven  separate  sessions  across  four  broad  topic  areas  informed  a 

deep community-based perceptions assessment of current resilience conditions in El Paso.  

While each session was framed around a specific topic area, all were public and open to 

input from all sectors of interest. In a specific effort to engage a diverse set of stakeholders, 

these meetings were held at locations across the city at a variety of times,  ensuring input 

on perceptions and ongoing activity from as many El Pasoans as possible.  

The graphic at left 

is illustrative of the 

compiled perceptions 

resulting from the eleven 

roundtable sessions. A 

common theme was 

the need to engage and 

empower a broader range 

of stakeholders.

22

Following the completion of the Resilience Roundtables, the El Paso 

Resilience Team engaged in a variety of pilot projects, workshops and 

exploratory research in an effort to validate the information gathered 

from stakeholders and attempt to test preliminary solutions.  From 

March 2015 - December 2016, the City of El Paso conducted over 

95 community engagement events, 21 stakeholder work sessions 

and  piloted  11  test  projects.    Our  resilience  team  communicated 

with just under 12,000 El Pasoans face to face and approximately 

70,000 via digital means over the course of this work.  

23

El  Paso  represents  one  half  of  the  largest  binational 

metroplex  in  the  Western  Hemisphere.  Our  regional 

population  is  expected  to  exceed  3  million  by  2030.  

But  more  than  just  numbers,  El  Paso  represents  an 

opportunity  to  define  the  paradigm  for  the  modern 

urban  border  environment.    Within  the  fabric  of  our 

community  there  are  an  abundance  of  challenges  to 

be  met.    However,  exceeding  those  challenges  are  the 

number  of  opportunities  in  front  of  us.  The  ability  to 

move  beyond  simple  survival  by  intelligently  adapting 

to  the  changing  world  around  us  is  what  presents  our 

biggest barrier to a thriving future.  

24

THE EL PASO RESILIENCE 

CHALLENGE

A  shock  or  stress  leading  a  city  to  complete 

failure  is  not  inevitable.  Shocks  and  stresses 

can  bring  opportunities  for  cities  as  well.  The 

experience may enable them to adapt, and in 

some cases, transform. 

CITY RESILIENCE
Is  the  capacity  of  individuals,  communities,  institutions, 

businesses  and  systems  within  a  city  to  survive,  adapt 

and thrive no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and 

acute shocks they experience.  

SHOCK OR STRESS

26

100  Resilient  Cities  has  recognized  resilience 

as  a  critical  part  of  the  urban  agenda,  and 

an  opportunity  for  cities,  particularly  rapidly 

growing cities, to ensure that their development 

can  enhance  rather  than  undermine  their 

resilience.

Resilience  doesn’t 

just 

involve  better 

understanding  of  hazards,  risk  assessments 

and  taking  action  to  reduce

It 

includes tackling underlying vulnerability and 

strengthening the city’s ability to withstand,

For over 350 years of continuous settlement, the people of El Paso have exemplified 

resilience, building a community that meets the challenges of a desert environment 

with its fragile ecosystem, weather extremes and variable water availability ranging 

from drought to flash flooding. 

As a modern binational city, we have tried to match this resilience, even as population 

growth  and  migration  have  exacerbated  environmental  issues  and  created  new 

challenges. We are dependent on the transport of food, water, and power to support a 

major urban center, yet our geographical and political boundaries work to concentrate 

transportation and communication arteries into a narrow, vulnerable corridor. Since 

we are on an international border, any meaningful response must be built on mutual 

respect and trust with our sister city in Mexico, Ciudad Juárez. 

Over  the  last  ten  years,  El  Paso  suffered  from  two  of  the  most  severe  shocks  in 

recent community memory.  In 2006, the city received the equivalent of two years 

annual rainfall over the course of just a few days.  The ensuing flood was more than 

city systems were designed to handle at that time.  The damage to both public and 

private property was in excess of $700 million, not to mention the cost of redesigning 

stormwater infrastructure for a city of 256 square miles in land area.  

In 2011, just as the community was beginning to recover from the flooding, the city was 

hit by a severe freeze.  Temperatures in our desert city plummeted in excess of  20° F 

below anticipated lows.  The community was not sufficiently prepared for the impact 

of such an event.  The freeze caused infrastructure failure at both the residential and 

city scale, leaving many residents without power or access to water for several days.  

As  our  community  begins  to  better  understand  the  shocks 

and  stresses  affecting  our  city,  we  also  begin  to  understand 

the  opportunities  presented  by  those  challenges.  Over  the 

last three years, the City of El Paso has identified a variety of 

areas  where  substantial  action  is  needed  to  build  long  term 

resilience for our community.  Pulling together solutions that 

cut across categories, address multiple challenges and create 

co-benefits for the entire community become the backbone 

of the this strategy.

The  following  pages  illustrate  a  deep  dive  into  the  social, 

environmental and economic challenges facing El Paso.

In both of these cases, our community was not as resilient as we had hoped to be.  

Infrastructure failures across the city caused widespread damage with an alarmingly 

disproportionate  impact  on  our  most  vulnerable  residents.  When  analyzing  our 

resilience in retrospect, it becomes evident that the severity of these events was 

a direct function of the chronic stresses present in our community rather than a 

function  of  the  actual  severity  of  the  climatic  event.  It  is  the  significant  number 

of  chronic  stresses  that  continue  to  decrease  our  capacity  to  be  adequately 

responsive not only to crisis events, but also affects our capacity to flourish socially 

or economically. 

To develop El Paso’s climate risk profile, the City of El Paso reviewed the city’s most 

recent hazard mitigation report and inputs from the perceptions exercise. Findings 

showed that El Paso faces relatively limited risk from climate related shocks due 

to  minimal  probability  of  extreme  level  events.  When  placed  in  the  context  of 

other  cities  which  face  the  impacts  of  sea  level  rise,  hurricanes,  tornadoes  and 

earthquakes, El Paso can be said to have a relatively stable climate. Risks posed by 

nature are frequently predictable and manageable under ideal circumstances.  It is 

the previously identified chronic stresses that limit our capacity to respond to even 

medium level shocks that present the greatest risk to our community.  

Extreme climatic conditions in El Paso are defined by rapid changes to environmental 

conditions often occurring with great force over a condensed time frame.  Shocks 

most relevant in our city include extreme heat, flash flooding, drought and sudden 

freezing conditions - in short, the effects of living in a desert environment. 

33

POVERTY

Over  a  quarter  of  El  Pasoans  live  below  the  federal  poverty  line  with  certain 

neighborhoods exceeding 40% of households in poverty.  Median Household Income, 

at  71%  of  the  US  average,  is  approximately  $42K  annually.    It  is  no  coincidence  that 

this  statistic  is  often  noted  under  both  economic  and  social  vulnerability.      As  many 

El  Pasoans  struggle  to  make  ends  meet  their  ability  to  bounce  back  when  struck  by 

shocks  decreases  as  well.    Individuals  and  families  living  below  the  poverty  line  are 

less able to take action when impacted by sudden flooding or soaring triple digit heat.   

In El Paso, high concentrations of poverty can be found clustered in the urban core.  

However, the number of low income neighborhoods are increasing toward the edges 

of the city particularly to the east.  In many cases neighborhoods have been informally 

established and lack access to critical infrastructure.  

34

POPULATION BELOW THE POVERTY LINE
American Communities Survey, 2014

MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME BY TRACT
American Communities Survey, 2014

A large portion of El Paso families earn less than their counterparts across Texas. A substantial 

proportion of residents are considered very low-income, with the City’s poverty rate greater 

than 20% (higher than the rate at the State level).  While El Paso has a lower cost of living 

as  compared  to  other  cities  in  the  United  States,  that  fact  does  not  sufficiently  mitigate 

challenges related to pursuing increased quality of life or prosperity.   High levels of poverty 

exacerbate other environmental and social challenges within the El Paso community.  When 

exploring  shocks  and  stresses  impacting  El  Paso  it’s  critical  to  consider  amplification  of 

impact within specific high poverty areas.  

35

ENERGY AFFORDABILITY

Unlike many other cities around the world, access to basic utility services is not an issue 

across the majority of the City of El Paso.  Affordability of those services, however, 

often presents an insurmountable barrier.   El Pasoans at or below 50% of the federal 

poverty level spend up to 30% of household income toward the cost of electricity. 

That means over 22,000 households in our community are energy challenged. Little 

to  no  widespread  access  to  or  knowledge  of  the  value  of  energy  efficiency  and 

renewable  energy    strategy  is  present  and  there  are  insufficient  resources  available 

to implement those strategies at the household level.  The perception that sustainable

Recently-proposed  increases  in  both 

base rates and solar customer demand 

charges  present  further  barriers  to 

the  promulgation  of  residential  scale 

renewable  energy  strategy.  Home 

upgrades are particularly challenging in 

aging areas of the city.  Efficiency efforts 

in  historic  homes  and  other  structures 

often  require  significant and  expensive 

upgrades.  Additionally,  residents 

in 

these  neighborhoods  are  often  elderly 

and survive on a fixed income incapable 

of supporting any up front cost impact.

in Texas and New Mexico as well as rates in 

Ciudad Juarez. 

TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS

El Paso is a car-based city defined by miles of highways, arterials and disconnected 

neighborhood streets.  Despite past efforts to shift toward a multi-modal community, 

the  majority  of  El  Pasoans  continue  to  depend  on  single  occupancy  vehicles  to 

access services across the city.  According to the 2000 US Census, 92% of El Pasoans 

commute  to  work  by  car  and  the  average  household  owns  1.7  vehicles.    Efforts  to 

36

alleviate  congested  traffic  conditions  by  expanding  the  existing  highway  system  are 

underway, generating a seemingly never-ending cycle of construction.  Additional efforts 

to expand the public transportation system are also underway.  Alternative transportation 

efforts have made great strides forward with the activation of a Bus Rapid Transit system 

called BRIO and the revitalization of the Downtown Streetcar Line.  However, these systems 

are limited in their capacity to service the widespread sprawl of the city.  At 256 square 

miles and growing, the physical expansion of our city is a barrier to comprehensive public 

transportation.    This  situation  is  particularly  impactful  to  portions  of  the  population  in 

poverty, preventing access to basic services and thereby exacerbating other vulnerabilities.  

It’s also critical to examine the cost impact of a lack of urban mobility in the context of the 

housing and transportation index.  In many El Paso neighborhoods, residents can expect 

to spend upwards of 25% of their household income on transportation.  

According to the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT), the average cost for housing 

and transportation in El Paso neighborhoods is 60% of household income. Combined with 

cost of electricity, some households spend up to 90% of income.

CNT also rates cities and neighborhoods on a scale of 1-10 with regard to factors such as 

job access, transit access and population density.  El Paso ranks relatively low in all three of 

these areas:

Job Access 

5.8 / 10 (Moderate access to 

jobs)

HUMAN HEALTH + PREVENTABLE DISEASE

The City of El Paso Department of Health identified obesity, diabetes, fitness and nutrition 

as the number one health priority for our community in 2013. In addition, of patients 

admitted to El Paso Children’s Hospital, bronchitis and asthma without complications 

has been identified as the number one general pediatric diagnosis.  These statistics are 

indicative of a population suffering from a high level of preventable disease directly 

affected by the surrounding physical environment.  According to the National Equity 

Atlas, 69% of adults in the El Paso Metro Area were classified as overweight and obese 

in  2012.    The  statistic  remains  relatively  consistent  across  ethnic  groups  as  well  as 

throughout a variety of neighborhoods within the City of El Paso.  According to Plan El 

Paso, adopted in 2012, “Those who live in completely unwalkable sprawl often have to drive  

for  all  of  life’s  daily  necessities, including  commuting  to school and work, purchasing 

food, attending services at places of worship, visiting friends and relatives, and even visiting 

health  and  fitness  centers.  This,  combined  with  industrialized  food  distribution  networks 

that facilitate the consumption of unhealthy foods while creating impediments to a healthy 

diet, can partially explain the rise in obesity and many related conditions.”

38

FOOD ACCESS

Food access is a complex issue whose challenges for El Paso lie in a variety of areas.  

Topics such as access to the right kind of food, cultural capacity to embrace healthy 

food  preparation  and  obfuscated  food  distribution  systems  present  barriers  to  a 

healthy El Paso.  Combined with other environmental challenges, food and nutrition 

become  part  of  a  larger  picture  of  critical  health  concerns  facing  residents.    Food 

Deserts,  areas  with  little  or  no  access  to  a  variety  of  nutritious  and  affordable  food, 

exist across El Paso and while access is a core issue, it can’t be addressed in isolation.  

According the HEAL (Healthy Eating Active Living) Strategic plan done by the Paso 

Del Norte Health foundation, ““one recent pilot study of the impacts of opening a new 

grocery store in a food desert showed no change in fruit and vegetable intake or BMI, 

highlighting  the  need  for  comprehensive  approaches  that  target  not  just  availability 

but also additional strategies to increase purchases and consumption of healthy foods, 

while keeping in mind the economic impact on low income residents in targeted areas.”

EXTREME HEAT

Extremely  high  temperatures  in  El  Paso  are  extremely  likely  to  occur  and  can  have 

severe  consequences  specifically  among  the  most  vulnerable  in  our  population.  

Extreme heat is a reality across the desert southwest, with temperatures in  El Paso often 

reaching between 105 and 110 degrees F in the mid summer months.  Impoverished and 

elderly communities are the most at risk.  Increased usage of refrigerated air mitigates 

comfort  issues  for  some  people,  but  increases  the  strain  on  the  local  electrical  grid 

and fails to address the concerns of those unable to afford it.   Emergency response 

capacity is relatively high as is neighborhood community support. However, increased 

volunteerism and citizen training programs are sporadic and limited in capacity.  

El Paso has seen an increase in the average number of triple degree days over the last 

hundred years.  In the summer of 2016, the community experienced 38 straight days of

triple degree heat as compared with the average 15.  This period of heat placed created an 

extended period of peak energy demand placing extraordinary strain on local infrastructure.  

The local utility was able to manage the demand, but the event was a reminder of the need 

to address energy usage and community safety during these events.  Four deaths were also 

recorded as a result of the extreme heat.  

40

DROUGHT

Drought is a frequently occurring condition in the desert southwest, with high likelihood, 

medium  impact  and  high  capacity  for  response.  Among  the  agricultural  community, 

the drought risk factor is high in that access to water for irrigation is critical to business 

and family livelihood.  However, water scarcity and continued drought is also of great 

concern to every El Pasoan.  The City of El Paso and the surrounding region is dependent 

on both ground and surface sources for water supply.  Surface water supplied by the 

Rio  Grande  River  is  dependent  on  upstream  sources  in  New  Mexico  and  Colorado.  

The El Paso Water Utilities recently declared the current situation of drought to be a 

key concern, “We usually depend on the river for 50 percent of our water supply. But 

because the river is dry, we are not going to be able to do that this year.”  Aside from 

surface  water,  El  Paso’s  groundwater  is  supplied  via  the  Hueco  and  Mesilla  Bolsons. 

Current supply for El Paso is about 9% surface water, 24% from the Mesilla Bolson and 

67% from the Hueco Bolson.   El Paso Water has pursued efforts to reduce pumping 

in the Hueco Bolson however it did increase in 2003, 2004, 2011, 2012, 2013 in direct 

response to drought conditions resulting from reduced river allocation.  Varying river 

allocations and continued drought conditions force groundwater levels and recharge 

to remain a critical concern for the region.

Constant  efforts  to  advance  technology  in 

an  effort  to  leverage  new  sources  and  extend 

the  capacity  of  existing  systems  are  being 

pursued  by  the  El  Paso  Water  Utilities.    The 

utility  operates  the  largest  inland  desalination 

plant  in  the  world  producing  up  to  27.5  million 

gallons  of  water  daily.    The  desalination  plant 

makes  a  previously  unusable  brackish  water 

supply  a  key  source  for  the  future  of  water  in 

our region.  Additionally, the utility has begun to 

explore  Advanced  Water  Treatment  processes 

that treat wastewater to potable levels delivered 

directly to the population.  This project, currently 

in  a  pilot  phase,  is  expected  to  begin  to  serve 

regional residents by 2019.  

FLASH FLOODING

Flash  Flooding  is  a  reality  in  a  desert 

environment.    However,  El  Paso  has 

experienced an increase in frequency and 

severity of storms resulting in significant 

flooding  in  recent  years.        Specifically, 

El  Pasoans  recall  the  impact  resulting 

from  the  flooding  and  storms  of  2006.  

El  Paso  receives  only  approximately 

8  inches  of  total  rainfall  a  year  with 

flooding occurring often under relatively 

light  rainfall  conditions  (ranging  from 

2-4  inches  at  a  time).    However,  even 

2-4  inches,  when  focused  in  a  small 

geographic  area  with  inadequate  man-

made  infrastructure  combined  with  a 

degraded  naturally  occurring  arroyo 

system and steep slopes can have severe 

impacts on citizens and property.  

42

Stormwater conveyance in the City of El Paso has 

traditionally  relied  on  surface  street  infrastructure 

to  move  water  during  a  storm  event.    Following 

the  storms  and  subsequent  damage  occurring  in 

2006, City Council established a stormwater utility 

managed  from  within  the  El  Paso  Water  Utility 

and  funded  by  monthly  user  fees.    A  stormwater 

masterplan  was  established  to  guide  capital 

investment in this infrastructure.  According to the 

El  Paso  Water  Utility,  “Natural  arroyos  provide  a 

stormwater runoff conveyance with built in energy 

dissipation  and  debris  removal  features.  Some 

arroyos are protected from development and remain 

as natural channels. Natural depressions can also be 

used  to  retain  stormwater  runoff.  These  areas  can 

be  integrated  into  the  stormwater  system  while 

being  preserved  as  wilderness  areas.”    10%  of  the 

established  stormwater  fee  is  directed  toward  the 

preservation of open space and greenways that are 

supportive  of  channeling  or  retaining  stormwater 

runoff. 

  Plan  El  Paso,  2012,  recommended 

production  of  a  comprehensive  map  illustrating 

critical arroyos and related ecologically  sensitive  

lands as a part of ongoing planning efforts.  This 

extended  mapping  study  will  be  required  to  have 

deep integration of natural and man made system 

within  a  comprehensive 

regional  stormwater 

management system.

BUILDING THE WORKFORCE

El Paso is home to a youthful population. The largest population group by age is 19 

years  old  and  under  (33%  of  residents),  while  a  smaller  21%  is  aged  20  to  34.  This 

data supports ongoing challenge of regional “brain drain” indicative of the exodus of 

young educated professionals from the area. Between 1995 and 2000, El Paso had a 

net migration of 18,565 adults with a high school education or above, including 11,203 

with some college education and 2,990 with a Bachelor’s degree.  This is particularly 

the  case  for  those  with  a  background  in  engineering  and  computer  sciences.  As  of 

2010, 85% of UTEP engineering graduates were leaving the region due primarily to low 

wages.

Retaining  and  attracting  talent  is  a  constant  challenge.  El  Paso  has  historically  suffered 

from a variety of cultural and economic barriers to post secondary education and in turn 

workforce  opportunity.    Our  predominantly  Hispanic  community,  struggles  to  overcome 

challenges  associated  with  an  undereducated  population  with  a  low  graduation  rate  and 

some  of  the  lowest  wages  in  the  country.  Local  efforts  to  address  workforce  and  post-

secondary education are therefore by necessity aimed at elevating opportunity for those 

that  are  most  vulnerable  in  our  border  community.    An  additional  barrier  is  the  lack  of 

consistent  connection  between  industry  and  education  in  terms  of  workforce  needs  and 

progressive  industry  creation.    There  is  a  great  need  to  set  common  regional  goals  and 

benchmarks for progress and opportunities for improvement.  
44

CHALLENGES OF A BORDER METROPLEX

El Paso is one half of the largest Bi-National Metroplex in the Western Hemisphere.  We 

are home to $54 billion in annual bi-national imports and exports.  Additionally, $64.7 

billion in goods are transported through El Paso every year.  Advanced manufacturing 

and logistics is a regional strength with great opportunity for innovation and expansion.  

However, opportunities for industrial diversification have the potential to be expanded 

based  on  the  variety  of  assets  present  in  the  region.    To  date  El  Paso  has  suffered 

from a lack of such diversification that leverages innovation and entrepreneurship in 

emerging industry sectors.  
There  are  variety  of  other  challenges 

presented  within  a  border  community.    For 

example, the presence of a large bi-national, 

bi-lingual  population  can  be  a  significant 

asset.  However,  many  bilingual  residents 

do  not  have  professional-level  fluency  in 

either  language  which  can  present  a  barrier 

to  development.  Communities  along  the 

border also face a number of environmental 

challenges  ranging  from  air  quality,  scarce 

shared  water  sources  and  degradation  of 

natural resources and ecosystems.  a systems 

challenge the region regardless of the location 

of the designated international border.

The purpose of pursuing resilience is not simply 

to brace El Paso for the next emergency, but 

to  leverage  our  challenges  as  opportunities, 

reinforcing our ability to move beyond survival 

toward a thriving future. 

46

CREATING OPPORTUNITY

While the challenges presented here are many, within 

each there is also great opportunity for our community 

to  thrive.  Social  vulnerability  in  El  Paso  is  largely 

based in issues of socioeconomic mobility and access 

to opportunity.  These challenges to resilience in our 

community  are  predominantly  defined  by  issues  of 

poverty, energy security, human health, urban mobility 

and  food  security.  It’s  often  the  poorest  among  us 

that  are  classified  as  the  most  vulnerable.    However, 

neighborhoods  with  the  highest  level  of  poverty  can 

exemplify the highest levels of resilience.  The ability to 

survive a variety of shocks and stresses has emerged 

as  a  cultural  trait  within  these  communities.    Social 

cohesion  in  El  Paso  is  reinforced  by  extended  family 

units and strong neighborhood ties.  The vulnerability 

lies  in  the  barriers  to  prosperity  beyond  survival.  

Families often lack the capacity to generate and retain 

wealth,  limiting  opportunity  for  current  and  future 

generations  to  thrive,  breaking  the  cycle  of  poverty.  

Low wages, educational opportunity, access to healthy 

lifestyle choices and limited mobility are all exemplary 

of the barriers facing this population.  

El  Paso  has  an  opportunity  to  enhance  quality  of 

life  and  promote  prosperity  across  the  community 

by  addressing  each  of  those  challenges  through  a 

cross cutting lens, inclusive of economic, social and 

environmental concerns. For example, by leveraging 

a regional history rooted in native American lifestyles 

that  traditionally  embraced  desert  food  systems  and 

natural  preparation  practices  presents  opportunities 

to  improve  human  health  and  reinforce  multi  cultural 

understanding.    Recent  community  interest  in  urban 

agriculture  provides  a  platform  to  affect  community 

cohesion  around  healthy  food.    Additionally,  by 

addressing  regional  food  systems  El  Paso  has  the 

opportunity  to  impact  other  areas  of  vulnerability

For example, there has been an enormous amount of 

study,  planning  and  investment  put  toward  an  effort 

to  revitalize  El  Paso’s  downtown.    A  key  example  of 

that effort, is the 2015 Downtown Plan.  In 2005 City 

Council  approved  funding  to  proceed  with  the  plan. 

The goals of that plan were to:

•  Create a Dynamic, Mixed-use Downtown Inviting all 

El Pasoans

•  Introduce  New  Investments  that  are  Catalysts  for 

all Downtown

•  Create Opportunities for Private Investment 

•  Enhance the City’s Cultural and Historic Heritage

•  Develop High Quality Housing for Area Residents

•  Create Jobs for El Pasoans 

•  Increase the City’s Tax Base.  

Each  of  those  goals  correlates  with  the  resilience 

challenges presented here.  However, progress to date 

toward  those  goals  has  been  inconsistent.    There  is 

incredible  opportunity  to  address  specific  resource 

issues such as energy and water demand by investing 

in  upgrades  to  the  urban  core  as  suggested  in  the 

plan,  while  creating  sustainable  revitalization  for 

downtown.

  

El Paso has a rich history full of success but also wrought 

with intense challenges.  Resilience is about recognizing 

the  strength  and  value  that  stems  from  both  of  those 

things.  We can’t forget where we’ve come from; we have 

to learn to live, love and act in the moment; but possibly 

most  important,  it  is  up  to  us  to  own  our  own  future.  

What is ahead of us is yet to be written.  How that story 

plays out for El Paso is in the hands, heads and hearts of 

El Pasoans.  

¡ADELANTE!

50

THE PATH FORWARD

The  resilience  strategy  is  a  roadmap  toward  building 

strength, adaptability and prosperity into our community 

now and well into the future.  The roadmap contains four 

Pillars  that  establish  a  foundation  for  the  work  to  come, 

13  specific  goals  clarifying  the  direction  of  the  work  and 

36  definitive  actions  that  identify  activities,  partners  and 

timelines. 

No one pillar, goal or action can achieve success in isolation.  

Much of the work in El Paso done to date has occurred in 

an  ad  hoc  manner;  one  effort  disconnected,  siloed,  from 

the  others.    This  strategy  is  intended  to  inextricably 

link  how  we  build  the  environment  surrounding  us, 

how we interact with each other and also to challenge 

government to lead our community toward a long term 

strategic vision of resilience.  

El  Paso  is  in  a  position  to  provide  global  leadership  for 

other  cities  facing  the  challenges  of  the  21st  century; 

ranging  from  the  evolution  of  city  infrastructure  to 

developing robust public private partnerships supportive 

of a resilient global economy to how to engage a diverse 

range of stakeholders .

These  tenets  will  define  the  work  ahead  for  El  Paso  and 

shape the future of the region.

THE VIBRANT DESERT CITY

The  effect  that  city  systems  and  infrastructure  can  have  on  a 

community is significant. The built environment is simultaneously 

a  reflection  of  who  we  are  and  have  been  as  a  people  as  well 

as  being  the  vehicle  that  moves  us  into  the  future.  El  Paso  will 

leverage  its  unique  rich  heritage,  cultural  identity  and  desert 

assets to transform behavior, advance city systems and enhance 

infrastructure to build a city capable of sustaining a high quality 

of life standard.  

THE THRIVING BINATIONAL ECONOMY 

El  Paso  is  one  half  of  a  thriving  binational  metroplex  that  for 

centuries  has  served  as  a  hub  for  commerce,  development  and 

international relations.  It is also part of a region that represents 

one of the largest manufacturing centers in North America.  As a 

globally  recognized  commerce  hub,  El  Paso  has  an  opportunity 

to  drive  the  direction  of  economic  growth  and  expansion  in 

the  region  by  defining  its  identity  as  an  environmentally  aware, 

creatively diverse, binational community.  

EMPOWERED EL PASOANS

Agency, in sociological terms, means, “ the capacity of individuals 

to act independently and to make their own free choices.”  Resilient 

El  Paso  has  to  begin  with  activating  the  agency  of  El  Pasoans.  

The  strength  of  our  culture,  the  richness  of  our  roots  and  the 

depths of our potential can only emerge through an empowered 

populace; change that begins from the grass roots up.  El Pasoans 

building their own vision of a resilient future for our city.

RESILIENT GOVERNANCE

Building  resilience  into  decision  making  for  government  should 

begin  with  activation  of  consistent,  open  and  collaborative 

partnerships.    Partnerships  between  public  agencies,  but  also 

collaboration with community groups, the private sector and non 

profit partners.  For El Paso, that means collaborating across the 

borders of 3 states and 2 countries.  A resilient El Paso depends on 

a collaborative, reflective and globally connected city government. 

PILLAR ONE

El Paso is a city made up of a series of complex physical systems that serve 

a diverse, international population.  It is the hub from which these systems 

have supported daily life across the region for centuries.  Critical components 

of  city  systems  include  housing,  public  facilities,  commercial  development 

and the infrastructure that connects them all together. Each has significant 

impacts on the health, wellbeing and prosperity of our community and our 

environment. Equal to the need to be careful stewards of our city for future 

generations is our responsibility to recognize the importance of our heritage 

and the commitment to the growth and prosperity of our community by the 

generations of El Pasoans who have come before us.  The City of El Paso will 

lead a comprehensive approach to sustainable development and smart city 

systems that have the capacity to provide long-term resilience in the context 

of an arid environment that has thrived for 300 years.

In early 2016, the Mayor convened an official Blue Ribbon Committee to review internal 

city process with regard to evaluation of local projects seeking municipal support of 

low income housing tax credit applications.  The committee spent approximately 9 

weeks evaluating key factors impacting affordable housing quality and supply in the 

El Paso community.  The following is a summary of those findings:

El Paso neighborhoods vary in scale and type, ranging from:

•  emerging downtown residential population

•  more sprawling middle – high income suburban neighborhoods

•  large-scale public housing communities concentrated in developed areas

•  new affordable housing in suburban neighborhoods

•  informal extremely low income colonias at the edges of the city

most neighborhoods lack amenities and infrastructure to: 

•  support resident well-being

•  integrate communities 

•  build overall resilience at a city scale

•  a  need  to  enhance  neighborhood  healthiness  and  livability  across  the  various 

communities of El Paso.

The Frontera Land Alliance, a non-profit organization, 

began in 2005 when a group of community members 

realized  there  was  an  urgent  need  to  help  preserve 

some of the important remaining natural and working 

lands  in  the  greater  El  Paso  and  southern  New 

Mexico region.  The organization has developed the 

knowledge and expertise to provide guidance to land 

owners  wanting  to  maintain  the  character  of  their 

land.

The Frontera Land Alliance has achieved a number of 

important  successes  in  land  conservation  as  well  as 

community outreach.  The ninety-one acre Wakeem/

Teschner  Nature  Preserve  at  Resler  arroyo  was 

acquired  in  2006.    It  serves  as  an  oasis  for  wildlife 

within  El  Paso  and  an  important  refuge  in  which 

community members can unwind and re-engage with 

nature.  It also acts as an important wildlife corridor 

and  conduit  for  water  to  another  nature  preserve 

downstream, the Keystone Heritage Park.

Thunder Canyon is a 24 acre arroyo set aside through an exciting partnership between 

local residents, the City of El Paso and Frontera.  The people living around the arroyo 

worked  with  the  City  and  Frontera  to  forge  an  agreement  through  which  the  City 

purchased the land from the developer and the residents agreed to repay the City for 

the initial costs.  Frontera holds the conservation easement that insures the land will 

never be developed.

Frontera  is  committed  to  educating  the  public  about  land  conservation.    In  this 

capacity, the organization has set up workshops for landowners, government officials 

and  the  general  public  to  help  them  learn  about  the  various  methods  that  can  be 

applied to conserve lands and the benefits to be derived from that process.

supportive of social, environmental and economic benefits.
Building  upon  work  established  by  the  Public  Service  Board  Preservation  /  Conservation 

Committee,  the  City  of  El  Paso  will  coordinate  an  interdepartmental  effort  to  establish 

an  open  space  development  toolkit  including  a  standard  evaluation  framework,  typology 

guidance tools alongside appropriate policy and incentives that maximize economic, social 

and  environmental  benefits.    Additionally,  the  City  of  El  Paso  will  prioritize  preservation 

of  land  identified  as  an  environmental  asset  in  alignment  with  the  proposed  Ecosystem 

Services Assessment.  Areas currently identified by city leadership include Rio Bosque, Red 

Sands, Castner Range, the Franklin Mountains and land surrounding the proposed regional 

trail system.

facilities. 
Departments within the Public Works Portfolio of the City of El Paso, in collaboration with 

regional experts and local professionals, will develop specific procedures and best practices 

supportive of increased building efficiency and community benefit including energy, water, 

open  space  and  connectivity.  Emphasis  will  be  placed  on  establishment  of  performance 

based  standards  and  companion  metrics  for  all  newly  built  city  properties.    For  existing 

facilities,  the  effort  will  focus  on  performance  improvements  through  smart  technology 

implementation as well as departmental behavioral adaptation. 
ACTION LEAD: Goal 7 Strategic Planning Team

PARTNERS: USGBC, AIA, Eco-Districts

RESILIENCE VALUE: : By applying a resilience lens to building design and urban planning practices, the City of El Paso will prioritize resource conservation, human health, social cohesion and economic opportunity on all projects, leading future development in the region by example.   GOAL 1.3
Establish a support mechanism for resilient development 
practices for private sector projects across El Paso. 

ACTION 1.3.1 Create a portfolio of alternative funding sources with the potential to fill 

funding gaps in private sector projects supportive of identified city resilience goals. 

The  City  of  El  Paso  is  currently  working  with  multiple  partners  to  identify  federal,  state 

and  private  funding  sources  focused  on  addressing  identified  resilience  challenges  such 

as  stormwater  management,  energy/water  efficiency,  mobility  and  historic  /  cultural 

preservation. When paired together, these sources have the potential to fill multiple funding 

gaps for private development. For example, energy efficiency grants paired with historic 

preservation incentives make possible an effective formula for retrofit projects in El Paso’s 

urban core.

ACTION  1.3.2  Embed  critical  resilience  criteria  into  existing  and  planned  economic 

dvelopment incentives. 

The Economic and International Development Department will create a rubric for measuring 

resilience  value  when  considering  the  deployment  of  existing  economic  development 

incentives. The new criteria will become a required standard measure for evaluating and 

prioritizing how incentives should be strategically awarded, with potential measures such 

as: number of skilled jobs, how the business addresses a resilience need in the community, 

its goals for ongoing community engagement, and its use of sustainable infrastructure.

RESILIENCE VALUE: By expanding institutional support for prioritized resilient development practices, the City will encourage sustainable long term planning while enhancing capacity for responsible growth for the private sector.In  addition  to  pursuing  exemplary 

building  performance  and  reduced 

environmental 

impact 

for  public 

facilities,  the  City  of  El  Paso  has 

established 

a 

track 

record  of 

supporting  projects  that  significantly 

contribute  to  the  sustainability  and 

vitality of our community.   The Cardwell 

Collaborative,  a  60,000  square  foot, 

$28  million  biomedical  research  and 

technology commercialization building 

developed by MCA  Tech Park, Inc., is 

one such project.  The building, named 

after local businessman and  philanthropist, Mr. Jack Cardwell, now stands as an icon, 

symbolizing the region’s proliferating biomedical community and serves as a reminder 

of the  achievements that can be attained through public-private collaboration.

The  three-story  LEED  Silver  building  features  20,000  square  feet  of  biomedical 

incubator  space  (wet-labs,  dry-labs,  lab  support,  private  offices,  open    offices  and 

collaboration spaces) in a building that brings private start-up companies and university 

personnel together under one roof to collaborate. TTUHSC  El Paso occupies 20,000 

square feet of space with a variety of office-based research and support departments. 

The other 20,000 square feet are occupied by the  MCA Foundation, a branch of the 

City of El Paso’s Economic Development Department and other non-profit companies 

that support the incubation mission.

The Cardwell Collaborative sits at the entrance of the “Research Park” section of the 

440-acre master planned MCA Campus. The academic medical campus is  organized 

into  the  following  sections:  education,  healthcare  delivery,  research  and  support. 

Campus  partners  include  Texas  Tech  University  Health  Sciences    Center  El  Paso, 

University  Medical  Center  of  El  Paso,  El  Paso  Children’s  Hospital,  City  Public  Health, 

State Psychiatric IP Hospital, West Texas Poison  Control Center, Coroner’s Office, Silva 

Health Professions Magnet High School, and MCA. Working together with the City of 

El Paso, these partners will  transform the once blighted neighborhood into a center 

for healthcare excellence and biomedical innovation. The City of El Paso has provided 

leadership in the  development of this Campus and economic center through funding 

and other partnerships with the MCA Foundation and other Campus stakeholders.

Downtown El Paso offers centuries of historical, cultural 

and bi-national potential.  In recent years, downtown has 

seen  a  tremendous  amount  of  activity,  both  public  and 

private.  Although very significant, that activity has been 

and continues to be somewhat ad hoc.

In terms of major public investments, the implementation 

of the Quality of Life Bond Program seeks to build on the 

success  of  the  Southwest  University  Park  Stadium  and 

the execution of the El Paso Streetcar through two new 

museums and a new arena.  In addition, various parking 

strategies have been implemented in addition to a recent 

initiative to focus on historic El Paso Street as an spine for 

a broader wayfinding and streetscaping strategy.

Regarding  private  development,  numerous  hotels  have 

or  are  soon  to  open,  along  with  numerous  restaurants.  

In  terms  of  residential,  Artspace  Lofts  and  a  handful  of 

other urban multifamily projects have been constructed.  

Hunt plans a major downtown office building, portending 

potentially other office opportunities.

Whether  focused  on  heritage  tourism  from  the  distant 

past, or historic preservation celebrating the more recent 

architecture  of  Henry  Trost  and  the  original  streetcar 

flowing  from  the  town’s  planning  ethos  during  the  City 

Beautiful  Movement,  El  Paso  has  begun  to  re-embrace 

its  authentic  historical  foundation  and  its  relationship  to 

Ciudad Juarez.

This amazing unfolding story presents an incredible future 

for downtown.  That momentum, nevertheless, faces two 

fundamental risks.  

•  One  is  that  emerging  synergy  among  the  myriad  of 

initiatives and activities is squandered because of their 

ad hoc nature.  

•  Second, the emerging gravity of economic development 

north  of  Paisano  Drive  is  not  connected  with  and 

resonant with the historic border retail economy south 

of Paisano. 

ACTION 1.3.3  Expand support for enhancement of El Paso’s cultural and historic building 

assets through inclusive planning, outreach and comprehensive research and analysis 

of targeted development sites. 

The Paso Del Norte region is rich with both cultural and architectural history. While much 

of this history has endured years of growth in the area, renewed attention must be paid to 

the value of what remains in terms of heritage tourism as well as economic development 

potential  in  terms  of  adaptive  reuse  and  revitalization  of  key  areas  including  the  Mission 

Trail, historic Ft. Bliss and the downtowns of both El Paso and Ciudad Juarez.

ACTION 1.4.1 Address identified environmental challenges by deploying best practices 

and identifying key performance-based metrics to assess infrastructure resilience. 

As an arid urban environment, El Paso experiences a variety of stresses ranging from limited 

regional water resources to water management in the face of flash flooding to intense heat 

for extended periods of time all triggering both infrastructure and human health challenges. 

Best practices for reducing runoff volume, improving water quality, minimizing heat island 

effect and maximizing energy efficiency will be prioritized as infrastructure development 

projects are implemented.  A keen focus will be placed on how to effectively deploy green 

infrastructure with capacity to address not only water management, but also improve air 

quality, enhance walkability, and beautify public spaces. 

The  City  of  El  Paso  will  convene  public  and  private  sector  stakeholders  to  design  and 

implement sustainable programs and practices on a citywide basis.  The municipality will 

institutionalize these best practices in the form of ongoing performance measurement and 

verification.  However, in order to overcome these challenges, the city will need to work 

with external partners to holistically combat the impacts of environmental stresses now 

and into the future.

targeted urban infill multi-use redevelopment site.  
While there are common themes among resilient development projects, the nature of each 

project  type  presents  unique  challenges  and  opportunities  to  establish  best  practices.  

The City of El Paso is currently planning for a demonstration of resilient development at 

a targeted urban infill site formerly utilized as a large scale sports venue.  The site, known 

as  Cohen  Stadium  is  nestled  just  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  Franklin  Mountains  between 

a  major  community  college  campus  and  a  quickly  revitalizing  residential  neighborhood.  

The  revitalization  and  repurposing  of  Cohen  Stadium  will  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  future 

development  in  northeast  El  Paso.  By  planning  a  master  community,  the  City  can  assist 

in bringing new opportunities, low-income housing and other necessary amenities to the 

region.

The social fabric of this portion of El Paso’s urban core remains vibrant, inspiring 

and strong despite sobering  demographics that illustrate many challenges.    A 

high  level  of  cultural  pride  is  associated  with  residents  and  is  evidenced    in  the 

variety  of  community  events  attended  throughout  the  year  and  made  manifest 

in  the  many  murals  that  can  be  found  across  the  territory.    A  specific  example 

of  this  cultural  strength  can  be  experienced  at  and  around  Lincoln  Park  and 

Lincoln Center toward the northern portion of this area.  To the south, Bowie High 

School represents a robust heritage continues to be a source of strength for the 

neighborhood. There is much work to be done across the urban core of El Paso 

with an extraordinary opportunity presented in this zone.

ACTION 1.4.4  Demonstrate and measure the multiple benefits of resilient development 

practices  focused  on  active  transportation  and  connectivity  along  a  primary 

redevelopment corridor. 
Utilizing the performance metrics established by the interagency regional planning group, 

the  City  of  El  Paso  will  deploy  best  practices  for  active  transportation  development  in 

targeted redevelopment corridors. The International Beltway portion of the Metropolitan 

Planning Organization’s (MPO) Alternative Transportation System provides an opportunity 

to demonstrate and measure success prior to full citywide application.  The International 

Beltway project covers and area spanning from the Medical Center of the Americas, past 

the Chamizal National Memorial, through the Chamizal Neighborhood and Segundo Barrio, 

connecting to El Paso’s downtown government and commercial districts and culminating in 

the historic Chihuahua neighborhood immediately north of the Paso del Norte International 

Port of Entry.   In 2017, in partnership with the Urban Land Institute, the City of El Paso 

convened  a  Resilience  Advisory  Panel  including  subject  matter  experts  from  around  the 

country.  The results of that advisory panel are intended to both guide the manifestation 

of the International Beltway and serve as an example of best practices to be implemented 

citywide.

PILLAR TWO

El Paso is the largest metro area along the Texas-Mexico border boasting a best-in-

class, business friendly operating environment as well as an authentic, deeply rich 

culture and unique urban desert experience. El Paso is also home to an emerging 

culture  of  innovation,  creativity  and  entrepreneurship  with  the  potential  to  rival 

the most robust global economies.  El Paso is focused on optimizing the use of 

environmental assets in the face of global climate change, activating the creative 

capacity of the largest bilingual, bicultural workforce in the western hemisphere 

and  leveraging  our  geography  as  an  international  hub  for  commerce  and  trade 

toward the goal of pursuing growth opportunities for 21st century industries.   To 

guide that growth, a core set of values can be utilized to triangulate opportunity 

for the bi-national metroplex.  Those values are defined by the promise of a clean 

technology future, an emphasis on the creativity and innovation capacity of local 

culture and a clear definition of El Paso’s robust international identity.

GOAL 2.1
Develop support vehicles for innovative industry 
development supportive of established core values. 

ACTION 2.1.1 Collaborate with regional partners, leveraging existing strategic planning, 

to develop tools that align priority industry clusters with identified core resilience values 

for economic development.   

As part of an extensive collaborative effort led by the Borderplex Alliance, The City of El 

Paso  has  worked  across  both  public  and  private  sectors,  bringing  together  leaders  from 

across  the  region  in  an  effort  to  identify  specific  goals  and  break  through  the  variety  of 

challenges unique to the North American Borderplex.  Specific emphasis has been placed 

on understanding current regional conditions in the areas of Education & Workforce as well 

as Planning & Development as they relate to strengthening 5 strategically identified industry 

clusters.  These industry clusters include Defense & Aerospace, Advanced Manufacturing, 

Advanced Logistics, Business Services, Life Sciences, Tourism, and Entrepreneurship. The 

City of El Paso has placed leaders from across the municipal organization within each of 

the  Borderplex  Task  Teams  as  well  as  the  Borderplex  2020  Strategic  Planning  Steering 

Committee.    Utilizing  these  partnerships  as  a  vehicle,  The  City  of  El  Paso  can  establish 

tools, aligned with core resilience values, through which to optimize business investment 

in  the  region,  identify  other  potential  target  industries  and  build  avenues  for  trade  and 

business  expansion.    Corresponding  metrics  will  outline  community  impact  benchmarks 

that have capacity to determine how industry can contribute to El Paso’s positive growth 

and minimize negative environmental and social impacts in the region.

RESILIENCE VALUE: By connecting a growth oriented economy to a core set of values based on our unique regional identity, location and resources, El Paso creates capacity to adapt to changing global conditions and shifting industry clusters while maintaining focus on established regional priorities . The vision for El Paso as a model 

resilient city requires us to address 

the  environmental  challenges 

of  the  21st  century  through 

collaborative 

partnerships, 

innovative 

technologies 

and 

integrated systems thinking.   As 

the  regional  population  expands 

and 

temperatures 

continue 

to  soar,  energy  becomes  a 

central  component  to  continued 

community  prosperity.    Energy 

efficiency and renewable energy 

development are the focal points 

of that effort. 

In  August  of  2016,  the  City  of  El  Paso,    alongside  the  Hub  of  Human  Innovation, 

the  Borderplex  Alliance,  El  Paso  Electric  and  the  Hunt  Institute  for  Global 

Competitiveness  convened  an  Urban  Energy  Forum  targeted  at  identifying  key 

challenges and opportunities to energy industry development in the Paso Del Norte 

Region.  Stakeholders from across the region of diverse backgrounds came together 

in a unique design lab format and were challenged to collaborate over the duration 

of the 4 hour workshop.  

KEY COLLABORATIVE OUTCOMES
 During the forum, several cross cutting themes were identified as potential barriers 

to energy industry development in the region:

•  Infrastructure  development  and  reliability  in  a  next  generation  environment 

including adaptive resource planning

•  Connectivity, collection and access to relatable data across municipal and regional 

networks

•  Application  of  regional  data  for  decision  making  in  terms  of  infrastructure 

investment, regulation and local policy

The ability to leverage new technologies such as the Internet of Things IoT, Big Data 

Collection and Smart City technologies could provide the path toward a renewable 

and resilient future for our community.

ACTION 2.1.2 Deploy a plan to create demonstration hubs across El Paso complimentary 

of  an  innovation  technology  park  focused  on  clean  technology  industries  with  an 

emphasis on energy and water demand challenges. 
As  the  regional  population  expands,  rising  energy  costs  and  limited  water  resources 

become  increasingly  central  components  to  continued  community  prosperity  as  well  as 

to business retention, attraction and expansion. The vision for El Paso as a model resilient 

city  requires  us  to  address  the  environmental  challenges  of  the  21st  century  through 

collaborative  partnerships,  innovative  technologies  and  integrated  systems  thinking. 

Research and development of innovative energy and water technologies are focal points 

of that effort.  By developing sites across El Paso as technology demonstration spaces the 

City  can  take  an  alternative  approach  to  attracting  leading  companies  from  around  the 

world  and  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  City  will  engage  multiple  public 

and private partners to align the efforts of research, development and land availability in 

the context of resilient infrastructure needs.  Key to the success of the initiative will be to 

leverage El Paso’s community entrepreneurs to enhance capacity for commercialization of 

developed technologies.

ACTION 2.1.3 Develop a comprehensive Urban Energy Plan focused on reducing energy 

demand,  easing  policy  barriers  to  renewable  technology  and  limiting  challenges  to 

investment in clean energy infrastructure. 
The City of El Paso will support a working team of energy-related partners such as El Paso 

Electric,  The  Hunt  Institute  for  Global  Competitiveness  and  The  University  of  Texas  at  El 

Paso  in  creating  a  comprehensive  urban  energy  plan  that  highlights  a  range  of  energy 

sources,  defines  clear  demand  reduction  goals  for  home  owners,  businesses,  and  public 

infrastructure and identifies policy barriers and limitations to industrial investment. The plan 

will focus on creating a City of El Paso Combined Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 

Standard.  This work will set goals across a variety of issues related to energy generation 

and management across El Paso including Capacity for Renewable Generation and Demand 

Reduction  Standards  as  well  as  Cost  Mitigation  Measures  and  required  Industry  and 

Workforce Development.

ACTION  2.1.4  Incorporate  critical  social  and  environmental  resilience  factors  as  key 

components of regional economic development initiatives. 

In just under the last 10 years, The City of El Paso has executed 126 economic development 

incentive agreements (2009 – present).  Over that time, nearly $1.5 billion in new capital 

investment has occurred in addition to over 7,000 jobs being added in just the last year. 

Currently, bonus incentives are available for businesses that locate in specific areas of the 

urban  core  or  establish  a  headquarters  in  El  Paso.    Additional  bonuses  are  available  if  a 

business  shows  support  for  local  education  and  workforce  initiatives  such  as  partnering 

with local educational entities, providing mentorship/internship opportunities or workforce 

training.  Offering higher wages and establishing hiring programs for target populations such 

as veterans are also encouraged.  In recent years, The City of El Paso has promoted a Transit 

Oriented Development Incentive Policy to link higher density, walkable neighborhoods to 

transit station and corridors.  The City of El Paso has solidly linked quality of life priorities 

to economic development incentives.  The next step is to evaluate how best to incorporate 

critical environmental and social resilience factors ranging from energy demand and water 

management to community benefit and corporate philanthropy.  As part of the Citywide 

Strategic Plan, Economic Development Incentives are evaluated every 5 years.

GOAL 2.2
Define workforce needs, activate key networks and develop 
support vehicles in support of small business development, 
leveraging  El  Paso’s  innovation  ecosystem,  community 
resources and local talent.

ACTION 2.2.1 Deploy a public-private partnership to establish an innovation center and 

co-work space in support of small business development and local entrepreneurialism.  

The  City  of  El  Paso  will  leverage  resources  across  the  Economic  and  International 

Development,  Community  and  Human  Development  and  Public  Library  Departments  to 

catalyze a partnership with the private sector to create the community’s first public co-

work  space  focused  on  enhancing  equity  and  access  to  opportunity  for  small  business.  

The physical pilot project will be located at the City of El Paso Main Library in the heart 

of downtown.  In addition to working and conference space, the center will offer access 

to  training  and  professional  development  resources.    The  goal  is  to  create  a  network 

that  through  municipal  support  and  private  sector  resources  encourages  cross-sector 

collaboration,  enhances  access  to  capital  and  promotes  local  talent.      Should  the  pilot 

project show success, the City of El Paso would seek to expand the program to other public 

library locations across the city.  Key metrics will focus not only on economic development 

and  business  success,  but  community  benefit  in  terms  of  equal  access  to  resources  for 

vulnerable population not traditionally served by this type of venture in the private sector.  

This initiative is also transformative for the El Paso Public Library system.  As the role of 

the library in the digital age continues to change, El Paso is moving to re-imagine that role 

for our community.

RESILIENCE VALUE: By activating key networks across a regional innovation ecosystem, El Paso builds capacity to support upward mobility and entrepreneurial opportunity for local talent while simultaneously attracting investment, expanding market opportunity and bolstering community economic stability.    ACTION  2.2.2  Collaborate  with  regional  partners  to  commission  a  study  that  will 

identify the needs of the local business community as well as workforce and educational 

institutions, which will be used to create and sustain a robust business retention and 

expansion program.

As the number of small, medium and large business grows, it is pertinent that the City of El 

Paso is equipped with the knowledge and insight needed to assist the business community 

and support organizations. By creating a foundation built on data and information, the City 

of El Paso can create a strategic program based on actual need rather than assumptions. 

Additionally, the results from the study will be shared with community partners in order to 

make existing programs more efficient and effective.

ACTION 2.2.3 Identify resources and training to close existing skills gaps preparing the 

regional workforce for emerging industry clusters. 

The  City  of  El  Paso  in  collaboration  with  established  partnership  groups  will  identify 

knowledge  and  skills  required  to  support  emerging  industry  clusters.    The  City  will  work 

with  local  colleges,  universities  and  professional  development  programs  to  encourage 

alignment  between  education  and  industry.    Economic  development  partners  will  track 

learning  objectives  and  participants’  skill  growth  over  time  to  ensure  that  initiatives  are 

successfully closing skills gaps and an addressing the changing needs of the local economy.  

The initiative should also look to provide learning opportunities for K-12 students as they 

grow and move toward pursuing career goals.  Through the collaborative partnership, the 

City of El Paso can encourage the development of  research projects,  internships and related 

mentoring  opportunities  for  students.  All  private,  academic,  and  workforce  development 

partners will collaborate to align short-term learning opportunities with job placement and 

industry needs.

El  Paso’s  abundant  natural  capital  is  a  critical  part  of  the  regional  ecosystem  and 

the  economy.  The  shrublands  surrounding  the  Franklin  Mountains  support  rich 

biodiversity,  capture  water  for  the  Hueco  Bolson  aquifer,  and  provide  many  other 

ecosystem  benefits,  from  erosion  control  to  moderation  of  flood  events.  El  Paso’s 

natural  capital  also  provides  direct  benefits  to  local  residents,  including  increased 

property values and improved health via recreation. All of these benefits are called 

ecosystem  services,  and  they  represent  significant,  long-term  contributions  to  the 

local economy. This work by Earth Economics, is the first study to estimate the dollar 

value associated with these critical ecosystem services within El Paso.

Across  the  country,  planners  and  policy  makers  are  starting  to  include  the  value 

of  natural  capital  assets  (watersheds,  forests,  shrublands)  and  ecosystem  services 

in  their  analyses.  Though  the  techniques  to  identify,  quantify,  and  monetize  these 

economic contributions are still evolving, the values available today can immediately 

be  used  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  symbiotic  relationship  between  a 

healthy  environment,  a  resilient  economy,  and  a  thriving  community.  Including 

these  values  in  planning  and  policy-making  yields  a  more  complete  and  accurate 

understanding  of  restoration  and  stewardship  projects  or  policies  and  ultimately 

fosters more practical, cost-effective outcomes. 

This analysis finds that the ecosystem services within the study area contribute $3.3 

million to $6.5 million in ecosystem service benefits each year. El Paso’s shrubland 

can also be viewed as a natural capital asset that provides a flow of benefits over 

time, similar to a building or a bridge. When measured like an asset with a lifespan 

of 100 years and a three percent discount rate, El Paso’s natural capital has an asset 

value between $106 million and $209 million. With sufficient stewardship to maintain 

the health and function of El Paso’s natural capital, this economic contribution will 

continue in perpetuity. These are highly conservative estimates that will grow as data 

gaps are filled and economic methods are developed.

As a preliminary step to building an ecotourism business plan, the City of El Paso will inventory 

natural resources, tourist attractions, hospitality partners, and local businesses that embody 

El  Paso’s  unique  identity  and  environment.  By  analyzing  the  economic  value  of  regional 

natural  assets  the  city  can  develop  preservation  priorities  and  tourism  opportunities  as 

well as extended infrastructure resilience. This work builds upon an initial asset assessment 

conducted in summer of 2016.

PARTNERS: PSB, Frontera Land Alliance, Borderplex 2020 Regional Partners

RESILIENCE VALUE: : By tying additional economic value to El Paso’s unique assets, the city will be better prepared to balance the protection and preservation of it’s heritage and natural environment as well as leverage local culture with the demands of a growth oriented economy. ACTION  2.3.2  Leverage  the  historic  nature  and  physical  assets  of  the  Paso  Del  Norte 

region to develop a heritage tourism plan focused on elevating El Paso as an international 

destination.  

By establishing a clear and comprehensive vision for enhancing local heritage tourism, El 

Paso  can  become  leaders  in  Texas  on  how  to  properly  promote  and  sustain  natural  and 

historic assets. The City of El Paso will accomplish this task by leading an effort to develop 

a strategy that will preserve key historic and natural assets. These assets will be leveraged 

to  transform  El  Paso  into  an  international  destination  location  that  properly  shares  the 

community’s  vibrant  culture.  Additionally,  the  city  will  continue  to  show  the  importance 

of  natural  and  historic  preservation  by  promoting  open  space  planning,  minimizing  the 

community’s carbon footprint and by preserving key historic buildings throughout El Paso.

local culture, art and film industries.  

El Paso’s economy has diversified and evolved over the last decade. With this change, it 

was imperative that the City of El Paso adapted to the new creative economy by identifying 

areas of opportunity. One such opportunity, was supporting local arts and culture initiatives. 

Developments such as the Roderick Artspace Lofts serve as an example of the commitment 

the  City  has  to  these  cultural  industries.  By  analyzing  the  role  cultural  arts  has  on  the 

economy, City Economic Development can continue to incentivize cultural arts programs 

and developments aimed to further diversify and enrich the local economy.

RESILIENCE VALUE: By prioritizing a variety of perspectives during program and project development, the city can create initiatives that address multiple community needs while increasing community engagement. El Pasoans have historically shown little trust in their 

local  government.  This  led  to  a  citizenry  that  was 

generally  disengaged  from  public  processes  and 

unsure  of  how  to  work  with  their  city  government 

to address issues in their neighborhoods. Residents 

struggled to understand what services and programs 

the  City  provided.  A  2004  Citizen  Survey  of  El 

Pasoans  showed  that  only  22.8%  of  respondents 

considered  themselves  to  be  “knowledgeable”  or 

“Very Knowledgeable” of City operations, programs 

and  policies.  That  lack  of  knowledge  and  know-

how  made  it  intimidating  for  many  residents  to 

contact  the  City  and  request  assistance  other  than 

for  emergency  services.  As  such,  the  survey  also 

showed that residents generally considered the City 

to be difficult to work with.

In early 2006, the City created a program dedicated 

to 

increasing 

the  number  of  neighborhood 

associations  as  well  as  to  empowering  residents  to 

work directly with the City.   One of the key programs 

providing  that  empowerment  is  the Neighborhood 

Leadership  Academy  (NLA).  The  NLA  is  a  free, 

18-week  course,  provided  free  of  charge  by  the 

City  of  El  Paso,  that  teaches  El  Pasoans  about  the 

operations, programs and policies of the City. Senior 

management from all City departments that provide 

services and programs to the public (currently more 

than 24 different departments) provide on-site field 

trips and/or presentations explaining what they do, 

why they do what they do, how they do it, and how 

residents and neighborhood associations can utilize 

their departments’ services and programs to address 

challenges  in  their  neighborhoods.  The  upcoming 

NLA  course  will  be  the  12th  overall,  and  the  first  11 

courses  saw  a  total  of  423  residents  complete  the 

program.

ACTION 3.1.3 Implement Civic Design Labs in advance of major city initiatives including 

capital projects, policy initiatives and strategic planning updates.

The City of El Paso will be responsible for leading interactive community sessions with a 

variety  of  stakeholders  and  community  members  as  a  tool  to  maximize  resilience  value 

for major city initiatives. The Civic Design Lab format offers an innovative way to actively 

engage  the  community,  building  upon  the  model  tested  in  the  Chamizal  neighborhood 

in  the  spring  of  2016.  By  replicating  the  design  lab  structure  for  more  than  just  physical 

projects,  the  City  of  El  Paso  moves  toward  a  shared  visioning  model  for  future  policy, 

project and planning development.  The City of El Paso Resilience team will leverage 100RC 

partnerships  to  establish  training  for  key  departments  across  so  that  implementation 

strategies will be embedded across the organizational structure.

GOAL 3.2
Connect  people  to  citywide  assets  and  programs  that 
address  community  challenges,  promote  community 
vitality and improve quality of life.

ACTION 3.2.1 Implement ongoing community learning programs focused on healthy, 

sustainable living practices supportive of grass roots resilience building.   

The City of El Paso will implement a Resilience Ambassadors Program to expand its reach 

and impact by training volunteers in specific sustainability and neighborhood improvement 

skills. With the guidance of subject-matter experts, these skilled volunteers conduct mini-

retrofits  and  improvements  for  local  El  Paso  businesses.  The  goal  of  this  program  is  to 

improve the resilience of our community by decreasing energy and water use, increasing 

awareness  about  conservation  and  sustainability  efforts,  and  encouraging  impact 

volunteering. 

The current cohort of Resilience Ambassadors have been trained on how to install pre-rinse 

sprayers and faucet aerators and use caulking and weather-stripping to seal air leaks. We 

will continue to expand this program to include training in skills such as garden construction, 

tree planting, bioswale installation, and other neighborhood improvement skills.

PARTNERS: Cities of Service, CNCS VISTA Program, Neighborhood Associations,

RESILIENCE VALUE: By leveraging existing partnerships and new initiatives aimed at connecting people to key resources El Pasoans are empowered to drive their community toward a healthy and prosperous future.  In  August  2015,  El  Paso  was  selected  to  participate  in  the  Resilience 

AmeriCorps  program,  a  first  of  its  kind  effort  to  support  local  resilience-

building efforts. El Paso was one of only 10 cities in the United States to be 

selected  for  our  committment  to  resilience  building.  The  Corporation  for 

National and Community Service (CNCS), the Department of Energy (DOE), 

the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  and  the  National  Oceanic 

and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  partnered  with  The  Rockefeller 

Foundation  and  Cities  of  Service  to  place  AmeriCorps  VISTA  members  in 

communities  to  provide  capacity  building  and  technical  support  for  climate 

resilience.  Through  the  program,  two  AmeriCorps  VISTA  members  were 

placed  within  the  City  of  El  Paso  organizational  structure  to  provide  much 

needed capacity to build sustainable food systems and impact volunteering 

initiatives.  In  addition,  $25,000  in  direct  funding  was  awarded  to  support 

the  impact  volunteering  projects.  As  a  result  of  the  Resilience  AmeriCorps 

program, two successful initiatives were launched, including the Garden Grant 

Program and the Resilience Ambassadors. The Garden Grant program funded 

the  construction  of  seven  garden  beds  which  produced  over  200  pounds 

of  food  over  the  Fall  2017  planting  season.  The  Resilience  Ambassadors 

program trained 18 community volunteers in water and energy retrofits. These 

volunteers  installed  over  150  aerators,  which  led  to  one  business  reducing 

their water bills by $1,241 over five months.  The two AmeriCorps VISTAs also 

drafted a Service Plan and Sustainable Food Systems Framework for the City 

of El Paso which will help drive change over the next decade.

As a member of the Resilience AmeriCorps program El Paso has demonstrated 

commitment to citizen inclusion and respect for community input resulting in 

an atmosphere of shared leadership and collaboration.  Building relationships 

between  government  and  residents  contributes  to  a  stronger  more  resilient 

city.

ACTION  3.2.2    Implement  place-based  solutions  in  key  locations  across  El  Paso 

neighborhoods to connect communities and city agencies. 
The City of El Paso will implement discrete, neighborhood-scale green urban intervention 

projects,  developed  through  an  inclusive  planning  process  with  local  residents.  These 

initiatives,  while  providing  additional  open  space  enhancements  to  an  area,  will  serve  as 

a living lab to showcase benefits to quality of life.  Our team believes that the traditional

ACTION 3.2.3 Establish a supportive policy framework for a sustainable and reliable food 

system in support of improved community health and equal access for all El Pasoans. 

The  City  of  El  Paso  will  support  the  Institute  for  Healthy  Living  to  understand  current 

challenges and opportunities facing El Paso’s food system including food sources, farmers/

farming networks, transportation/distribution methods, waste management as well as crisis 

response systems for those in immediate need.  The City of El Paso alongside key community 

partners will build new policies and programs to both food security and a healthy future for 

all El Pasoans.   The role of the City of El Paso will be to respond to identified challenges 

through  local  policy  initiatives  as  well  as  municipal  operations  support  for  key  programs. 

Together,  the  partnership  identify  strengths  and  vulnerabilities  in  El  Paso’s  food  system 

and work to address potential gaps by drafting policy ideas, initiatives, and even potential 

backup plans in the event of an emergency.

GOAL 3.3
Improve  conditions  and  enhance  preparedness  for  low 
income  residents  by  providing  access  to  resources  that 
address community resilience challenges. 

ACTION 3.3.1 Expand and enhance access to El Paso’s First Time Homebuyer Program.

The purpose of the City of El Paso’s First Time Homebuyer Program is to assist low and 

moderate income individuals and families in achieving their goal of home-ownership.  While 

this  program  has  been  in  place  for  about  a  decade,  capacity  has  limited  the  number  of 

El  Pasoans  assisted.    The  City  of  El  Paso  will  launch  an  expansion  of  this  program  with 

the intention of doubling the number of First Time Homebuyers by 2019.  In concert with 

the  program  expansion,  the  department  of  Community  and  Human  Development  will 

expand  access  to  educational  programs  for  applicants  in  the  areas  of  personal  financial 

management, and conservation best practices for utility cost management.

RESILIENCE VALUE: By leveraging mulitple community assets and increasing access to resources El Paso will improve the capacity of the most vulnerable to prepare for and respond to shocks and stresses.ACTION 3.3.2 Connect residents with existing community development funding sources 

targeted at home repair and neighborhood improvement for low income population.

The  City  of  El  Paso  will  leverage  community  partnerships  to  promote  awareness  and 

expand  access  to  existing  low-cost  loans  for  home  improvements  for  low  to  moderate 

income  families  and  individuals.    These  loans,  for  amounts  up  to  $65,000  can  be  repaid 

and/or  deferred  up  to  30  years.  With  a  current  interest  rate  of  0%,  the  program  makes 

much needed improvements to existing homes accessible for El Pasoans who traditionally 

cannot  afford  to  do  so.    By  focusing  improvement  funding  on  projects  that  can  reduce 

future maintenance and utility costs for residents, the program supports financial stability 

for participants beyond the physical benefit to the home.

ACTION  3.3.3  Create  the  City  of  El  Paso  Senior  Corps  program  by  consolidating 

resources and staff toward the enhancement of the Retired Senior Volunteer Program 

and the Foster Grandparent Program.  

The  Retired  Senior  Volunteer  Program  and  the  Foster  Grandparent  Programs  have 

existed  as  an  offering  of  the  City  of  El  Paso  for  over  30  years.    Since  their  inception, 

both  programs  have  achieved  significant  success  and  engaged  an  enormous  number  of 

El  Pasoans.    However,  in  recent  years,  programs  funded  at  the  federal  and  state  levels 

have  been  asked  to  do  increasingly  more  with  significantly  fewer  resources.    In  order  to 

adapt to these changing conditions while continuing to expand programming, the City of El 

Paso has aligned these two programs and created a Senior Corps for our community.  The 

Senior Corps is a program that will provide enrichment for older adults through community 

service.  It encourages seniors to bring a lifetime of talent, experience, skills, and hobbies to 

the forefront in service of community projects, organizations, and agencies in need.   

In addition, the Senior Corps will serve as a model for the development of other volunteer 

engagement  programs  for  target  population  needs.    Next  steps  will  be  to  explore  the 

potential for engagement of veterans and active military families as well as children and 

youth.

El Paso is a key piece of the largest bi-national metroplex in the western hemisphere. 

We are a vibrant, innovative culture-rich with opportunity waiting to be catalyzed. 

The  path  toward  resilience  for  our  community  has  to  begin  with  collaboration 

among  a  diverse  set  of  partners,  regionally,  nationally  and  globally.  The  path  is 

paved  by  exploration  of  expanded  networks,  international  best  practices  and

Continue  to  enhance  the  practice  of  resilience  within  the 
organizational structure and operations of the City of El Paso. 

ACTION 4.1.1 Leverage City of El Paso Strategic Plan Goal Team Structure to enhance 

interdepartmental communication emphasizing ongoing application of the resilience 

lens to citywide operations and investments.   
The  City  of  El  Paso    Performance  Office  has  worked  with  the  resilience  team  to  embed 

resilience-focused goals, measurements, and planning approaches into the City’s Strategic 

Plan.    The  plan  is  built  so  that  it  can  be  continuously  adapted  based  on  department 

feedback,  modifications  to  planning  approaches  and  community  priorities.  In  order  to 

further resilience building and create broader regional alignment, The City of El Paso will 

consistently reference the Strategic Plan when working with external partners such as the 

Greater Chamber of Commerce, El Paso County leadership and Borderplex Alliance among 

others.
ACTION LEAD: City of El Paso Performance Office

PARTNERS: All City Strategic Planning Goal Teams

102

RESILIENCE VALUE: By embedding resilience thinking into the city’s organizational approach El Paso will ensure that municipal practices and policies always take an interdisciplinary approach to facing regional challenges, maximizing the value of its investments.ACTION 4.1.2 Ensure ongoing execution of strategic planning goals and actions through 

continuous reporting, accountability and budget alignment.  

The City of El Paso ties its budget process to its strategic plan in several ways. First, City 

Council’s priorities are identified and developed into specific strategies every year. By doing 

this early on, the Office of Management and Budget is able to formulate how to fund the 

different initiatives. Second, the budget is categorized and presented by Goal teams instead 

of by departments. Rather than seeing separate presentations for Libraries, Museums, Parks, 

and Zoo, they are all combined into one goal of Quality of Life. This allows City Council to 

see how much is being allocated to the individual departments as well as towards achieving 

the  goal  of  an  improved  quality  of  life  for  all  residents.  Key  Performance  Indicators  are 

reported by Goal teams as well since they are operationally linked through the services that 

are provided. Furthermore, supplemental requests to the budget are required to be directly 

linked to a strategic planning goal as well as illustrate how the request contributes to their 

goal within the strategic plan, and how that success will be measured. 

The City of El Paso has already integrated resilience concepts into the City Strategic Plan and 

as such has embedded resilience within the city budgeting process.  As resilience building 

work moves forward, the City of El Paso Performance Office and the Office of Budget and 

Management in partnership with the Chief Resilience Officer will further align operational 

budgets to identified resilience goals. Alignment will be guided by best practices gathered 

from across the 100 Resilient Cities Network.

El Paso will be a world class, highly competitive  

international    border    community    that    draws 

trade,  technology,  and  tourism  to  its  cultural, 

geographic,  and  environmental  attractions 

through unparalleled interregional and binational 

cooperation.

International Trade

Leverage El Paso’s binational border location and 

unique assets to draw more businesses and trade 

to  the  area  including  preserving  and  expanding 

existing businesses.

Border Health Issues

binational health organizations that target health 

issues unique to the United States/Mexico border 

to  ensure  there  are  sufficient    preventive    and  

health  resources  on  both  sides  of  the border.

Cultural Vitality

porting  innovative  immigration  reform  through  

training  and educational opportunities.

GOAL 4.2
Cultivate local, regional and global relationships supportive 
of cooperative resilience building efforts. 

ACTION 4.2.1 Take a leading role in the  global network of resilience practice.  

Because El Paso has the unique position of serving as a desert-oriented, binational city, 

the City of El Paso is committed to communicating successes and highlighting progress 

towards goals with the 100 Resilient Cities network, Cities of Service, Urban Land Institute, 

and other partners.  City leadership will share El Paso’s work and strategic approach to 

resilience in publications, conferences and other resilience-related events, highlighting  the 

role  of  the  bi-national  metroplex  and  what  that  means  in  terms  of  building  global  best 

practices.  A prime example of this leadership is El Paso’s participation in the Sister Cities 

Initiative.  As a leader in social cohesion and binational cooperation, the City of El Paso will 

seek out opportunities to assist other municipalities in implementing best practices. 
ACTION LEAD:  City of El Paso Leadership Team

PARTNERS: 100RC, Cities of Service, USGBC, APA, ULI, NLC, US Conference of Mayors

ACTION 4.2.2  Seek out and activate external partnership opportunities with public 

agencies,  non  profit  organziations  and  community  groups,  serving  as  a  conduit  for 

communication with municipal leadership. 

Successful communities are built on strong partnerships and robust collaboration between 

a diverse array of stakeholders.  The City of El Paso as an organization is in a position to lead 

collaborative efforts toward the ongoing growth and prosperity of the entire community.   

By  bringing  together  various  partners  across  both  the  public  and  private  sectors,  the 

ambitious  goals  set  forward  by  municipal  leadership  can  be  achieved  and  community 

expectations  exceeded.    A  designated  City  of  El  Paso  team  will  formalize  an  alternative 

engagement model that brings stakeholders together under a framework of common goals.  

ACTION LEAD:  Goal 5 Strategic Planning Team

PARTNERS: Borderplex Alliance, County of El Paso, Metropolitan Planning Organization, 

State Legislative Delegation, Community Non Profit Sector, Greater Chamber of 

Commerce, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce

RESILIENCE VALUE: El Paso will serve as a thought leader and catalyst for resilience

ACTION 4.2.3 Establish El Paso / Ciudad Juarez as a dynamic and seamless binational 

community emphasizing both economic and cultural development potential. 
The governing bodies of both the City of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez have approved the 

creation of a binational task force comprised of two city council members from each city 

as well as relevant staff members focused on optimizing resources and maximizing regional 

impact of binational projects and initiatives. The task force will identify priorities for the bi-

national community and make recommendations to be considered by both city councils at 

regularly scheduled bi-national council meetings held in alternating locations on both sides 

of the border.  The task force provides the framework for an ongoing collaborative decision 

making vehicle with the capacity to align efforts on an international scale.

Fort Bliss was originally located near Downtown El Paso and later  at  several  other  

locations  within  today’s  City  limits.   In 1893 the post was moved to West Fort Bliss, 

just west of the El Paso International Airport.

Fort  Bliss  became  a  major  military  training  center  as  the  onset  of    World  War  II 

triggered a boom in El Paso’s economy. By 1942 Fort Bliss was the largest Army base 

in the nation.  After the war, Biggs Air Force Base established itself as an important 

military post in the region. Biggs was closed in 1966 and reactivated as Biggs Army 

Airfield in 1973. Fort Bliss is currently home to the 1st Armored division.

GOAL 4.3
Connect people and initiatives across the region, activating 
the bi-national community.

ACTION 4.3.1 Develop regional scale community events focused on connecting people 

across borders. 

Collaborating with a variety of local and regional leadership as well as community-based 

groups in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, the City of El Paso will support the implementation 

of  community  events  focused  on  resilience  building  and  social  cohesion.    Potential 

event  topics  may  include  a  celebration  of  the  ongoing  relationship  between  El  Paso  and 

Ciudad  Juarez,  health  and  wellness  educational  opportunities,  or  economic  development 

networking among businesses and related partners, among other initiatives.  At least two 

regional community events will be executed annually.

ACTION  4.3.2  Promote  bi-national  and  interstate  adoption  of  regional  planning  best 

practices. 
Based  on  scientific  research  and  best  practices,  El  Paso  will  partner  closely  with  Ciudad 

Juarez and the communities of Southern New Mexico to outline ambitious infrastructure and 

development goals for the region and work with related partners to make progress towards 

those goals.  The city will also support coordination efforts with academic institutions, such 

as  The  University  of  Texas  at  El  Paso,  to  guide  policy  and  program  planning  while  also 

supporting interagency collaborative efforts.

RESILIENCE VALUE: El Paso and Juarez together will develop long-term binational planning in issues that build resilience across national borders, showcasing the intersection of physical, environmental, and social impacts common to both communities.The  El  Paso  /  Las  Cruces  /  Juarez  Metroplex  has  taken  on  an  important,  complex 

and very high potential program aimed at improving the innovation culture in their 

region.  This  is  a  tough  challenge  and  it’s  complicated,  nuanced  and  often  hard  to 

define.  Overcoming  the  challenge,  the  Innovation  Frontera  identified  several  key 

components to success:

•  Grow a vibrant interconnected innovation ecosystem

•  Foster connectivity, trust and collaboration

•  Celebrate role models, lower barriers and activate networks

•  Adaptive prideful messaging for the region

•  Cultivate openness, serendipity and willingness to take risk

•  Activate the global opportunity for the innovation frontera

PURPOSE OF INNOVATION FRONTERA: To create prosperity without borders. 

As  part  of  the  first  steps  of  this  effort,  the  collaborative  group  came  together  to 

establish a social contract, or method of working together emphasizing cooperation, 

diversity,  trust  and  binational  experimentation.    Each  participating  organization 

commits to the tenets established. That contract came to fruition as follows: 

•  I  am  joining  a  diverse  inclusive  global  community  of  people  who  share  a  belief 

in  the  culture  of  innovation  and  entrepreneurship.  I  commit  to  collaborating  as 

part of a bi-national community for the betterment of our region, El Paso, Cuidad 

Juarez, and southern New Mexico a

•  I will recognize, celebrate, and encourage role models publicly. I am committed to 

grow as a role model of innovation and to evolve to as an individual, a worker, a 

family member, and community member.

•  I understand that I will receive valuable help from others for free or at a very low 

cost. I agree to “pay forward” whatever positive benefits I receive.

•  I  will  give  trust  to  others  before  expecting  to  receive  trust  in  return.  I  will  treat 

everyone fairly and respectfully.

•  Collaborate, Collaborate, Collaborate. Together we will be more innovative. I will 

bring people together, participate in gatherings of others, and invite and encourage 

others  to  collaborate  to  identify  problems  and  innovate  toward  solutions  that 

benefit the community.

•  I will dream, experiment, iterate, and persist. I will encourage others to do the same. 

I understand that mistakes and failure are acceptable ways of testing new ideas. I 

will open myself to learning from others. I will help nurture learning in others.

•  I will live these ideals as a member of this bi-national global community. I will share 

these ideals and encourage other to embrace them.
