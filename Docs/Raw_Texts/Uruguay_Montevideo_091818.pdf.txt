LETTER

MICHAEL 
BERKOWITZ

PRESIDENT OF 100 RESILIENT CITIES

We are in the midst of a time of change loaded with 
multiple transformations and challenges and one of the 
most significant among them is the unprecedented growth 
of urbanization, particularly in Latin America. 80% of Latin 
Americans live in urban centers, which are spaces in which 
approximately two thirds of the gross domestic product 
of our countries is generated. In order to ensure the 
wellbeing of future generations, cities seem to consolidate 
themselves as the main scenario to be promoted in terms 
of resilience. Local governments - as direct recipients of 
the positive and negative impacts of globalization - are 
called to redouble their efforts in a context of cooperation 
and support within the New Urban Agenda and the 
Sustainable Development Goals framework, to generate 
conditions that ensure, considering their proximity with the 
population, the right to the city of all its inhabitants. 

Montevideo has been working for decades on designing 
public policy guidelines with a prospective vision, and 
from its planning they have been aligned under a socio-
territorial approach. Efforts have been made to reverse 
the segregation processes in the urban fabric, the lack 
of access to housing and public services, as well as the 
social, environmental and economic vulnerability of the 
most susceptible sectors of our society. 

Given these challenges, we understood that at this 
development stage of Montevideo, our first objective 
was to increase the capabilities of our city, having a deep 
understanding of its weaknesses and strengths, addresing 
the demands of its inhabitants and encouraging us to think 
about our desire to build the Montevideo that we dream of 
from a new approach.

Thanks to developing the resilience strategy process, we 
managed to identify the shocks and stresses that threaten 
our city. We approached them in a collaborative way, 
incorporating into the process the largest possible number 
of actors that make up this system’s “subsystems” 
which determine the social, cultural, economic and 
environmental relationships of our territory. Consequently, 
the results allowed us to identify (with a holistic approach) 
the challenges that the city presents, allowing us to 
elaborate answers that promote wealth and diversity into 
Montevideo’s reality. 

Having the opportunity to be a part of the 100 Resilient 
Cities network has allowed us to advance substantially in 
this way, providing us support for generating a transversal 
approach when planning and managing the city, promoting 
the integrality and complementation of actions, which are 
encouraged from the departmental government.

This Resilience Strategy represents a great step forward 
in the aforementioned challenges. In it we see a living, 
dynamic and open document, whose main objective is 
to guide us in the process of transforming Montevideo’s 
reality, marking the guidelines that we must follow in order 
to build a more inclusive, supportive, innovative, dynamic 
capital, prepared to face the challenges of building a better 
future for its population. On the other hand, it acts as an 
invitation to all of you to join us from your different roles in 
the beautiful challenge of building an increasingly human 
and resilient Montevideo.

to the city’s resilience, the Strategy promotes making 
Montevideo a more inclusive and supportive city. One of 
the most innovative aspects of Montevideo’s Strategy 
is the Resilience Labs—spaces for experimentation that 
offer ways to rethink solutions and pilot new models of 
governance—which will transform Montevideo's capacity 
to respond to 21st century challenges. Some of the many 
innovative goals in the Strategy include improving the 
quality of public transportation, transforming public 
spaces into catalysts for environmental conservation and 
socioeconomic development, and using digital tools to 
facilitate participatory governance.  

Through the commitment and hard work of Chief 
Resilience Officer Gabriella Feola and her team, and the 
leadership of the Mayor Daniel Martínez, this Strategy is an 
accurate reflection of Montevideo’s needs and priorities.
This strategy is only the beginning of the exciting work 
to come in the months and years ahead. From the 100 
Resilient Cities family, we are very excited to continue our 
collaboration with Montevideo and to be a strategic ally in 
the implementation of initiatives, which will have a positive 
impact for all Montevideans. Congratulations again on this 
enormous achievement!

On behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, I am 
proud to congratulate the city of Montevideo, Mayor Daniel 
Martinez, and Chief Resilience Officer Gabriella Feola on 
the release of the Montevideo’s Resilience Strategy. This 
is an important milestone for our partnership and for the 
city, and we are proud to have been part of one of the most 
innovative efforts in Uruguay, in our network, and in the 
region.

Since its founding in 1726, the capital of the Oriental 
Republic of Uruguay has had a high quality of life and 
vibrant culture reflected in its architecture, traditions, and 
music. With a lengthy coastline and significant rural areas, 
Montevideo is more than just an urban center. However, 
rapid urban expansion and the impact of acute shocks 
constantly challenge the stability of Montevideo’s urban 
fabric and threaten its natural resources.

Both Uruguay and Montevideo have positioned themselves 
as global leaders in reducing carbon emissions due to 
major political changes brought about by participatory 
and strategic planning. Montevideo’s Resilience Strategy 
builds upon this work and presents a unique opportunity 
to address unresolved urban challenges. An essential part 
of developing the Resilience Strategy is understanding 
and addressing Montevideo’s acute shocks and chronic 
stresses, whether they be flooding, infrastructure collapse, 
economic inequality, or lack of public transportation.
Montevideo’s Resilience Strategy shows the city’s 
progress in engaging a broad range of stakeholders while 
keeping citizens at the core of its vision. With 4 pillars, 
14 objectives, and 40 concrete actions that contribute

RAMÓN
MÉNDEZ

PLANNING AND RESILIENCE DEPARTMENT 
DIRECTOR 

Montevideo has a long history in strategic planning. The 
elaboration of a territorial and urban planning for the 
city more than 20 years ago, known as the Montevideo 
Plan, was innovative for both the country and the 
region. It enabled an understanding of urban planning, 
a higher commitment to the territory and citizens by 
choosing to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants, 
the improvement of their public services and their 
environmental conditions. Continuing with this tradition, 
we find ourselves in a new process, to agree on our vision 
of the future — Montevideo’s vision of tomorrow - with the 
participation of different actors: public, private, academia, 
neighbours, social, political and professional organizations. 
We understand that building the resilience strategy within 
the framework of this process, causing a cross-synergy 
between both, is a great opportunity and the best way 
to incorporate the resilience perspective into a strategic 
approach.

When deepening the concept of resilience, we found that 
Montevideo had been working on many aspects that 
had already contributed to improving its resilience, and 
so we sought to identify those actions and put a value 
to them. For this reason, many of the initiatives that we 
are proposing in the four pillars of the strategy maintain 
a common thread with what has been done previously, 
but with a short, medium and long-term projection. As 
a novelty, I highlight the presentation of three resilience 
laboratories, which are processes that address strategic 
issues in a transversal manner, placing resilience in their 
core and providing a new perspective of management.

LETTER

THE RESILIENCE 
TEAM

We are proud that Montevideo has a resilience office in the 
Planning Department, capable of enabling the participation 
of different sectors into the discussion and being able to 
build agreements on key issues that guide the resilient 
development, and that are all consolidated with this 
Strategy. 

The new challenge that we now face is to advance in 
its implementation, following always a transversal, 
articulating and participatory path. We hold many 
expectations in achieving concrete and visible 
transformations, which not only improve physical spaces, 
but also people’s lives, and thus, promoting social 
integration. 

I am grateful to the 100RC Program of the Rockefeller 
Foundation for selecting Montevideo out of one hundred 
cities, for facilitating our participation in a network that 
promotes the exchange of experiences, and for supporting 
our path towards building a more resilient Montevideo for 
tomorrow.

Building urban resilience means transforming the 
challenges of our cities in the face of global change 
and uncertainty, into opportunities that guarantee its 
inhabitants the full exercise of their rights, based on 
tolerance, solidarity and respect for diversity in all its 
expressions.

local and national government, as well as with civil society 
actors, academia and the private sector. At a strategic 
level, it ensures the continuity of the process that has been 
initiated, granting sustainability to the implementation of 
the strategy beyond the political and economic situation 
that the future may determine.

Under this framework, we are pleased to present this 
document, which constitutes as the road map for building 
a resilient Montevideo and which is the result of an open 
and collaborative process that incorporated diverse voices 
and views on the daily reality of Montevideo.

The resilience strategy recognizes the work that has 
been done, capitalizing on successful initiatives from 
diverse local actors, by which we seek to further 
strengthen the value of resilience through an articulate 
and complementary holistic approach; it also incorporates 
new specific proposals that contribute to the solving of 
the resilience challenges that have not yet been solved. 
The collaborative approach adopted allowed us, in turn, 
to begin to integrate the resilience perspective into other 
planning processes; amongst them is the strategic plan 
«Montevideo del mañana», a process that is building a 
long-term vision in metropolitan and national terms in a 
participatory and collective manner.

A fundamental milestone in building this initiative was 
the creation of the Resilience Executive Unit (UER for its 
acronym in Spanish) within the Planning Department of 
the Intendency of Montevideo. This institutionalization 
allowed, at a tactical level, to legitimize the advancement 
in elaborating the strategy and strengthening the role of 
the new unit in its relationship with other areas of the 

This document is the culmination of a process of 
articulation, of joint learning, of the collective generation 
of ideas, which all promote a connected and dynamic 
Montevideo, inclusive and supportive, innovative and 
co-creative, committed and prepared. But it is also the 
beginning of a new phase, which implies a shared effort 
and a collective responsibility to effectively build that so-
desired Montevideo.

Being part of the 100 Resilient Cities Program has allowed 
us to get to where we are today. The Program has provided 
support, both technical and methodological, as well as 
professional and human, bringing us closer to the realities 
and experiences of other cities, which all act as ongoing 
inspiration for our work. We are convinced that being a 
part of this network is a value in itself, which allows us to 
have a broader and more comprehensive vision of what it 
means to build a more resilient city today. 

We express our gratitude to the 100 Resilient Cities 
Program for its invaluable support in each phase of the 
process; to Arup, our strategic partner, for their constant 
collaboration, and to all those who in one way or another 
have contributed to the development of this strategy, 
which will allow us to achieve a more resilient Montevideo 
together.

EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY

Montevideo is the capital of the Eastern Republic of 
Uruguay and is also the administrative headquarter of 
Mercosur, located in the south of the country with its coast 
bordering Río de la Plata. It is a port city, as well as an 
economic and cultural hub, with a strategic geopolitical 
position that naturally rendered it a critical node for trade 
and tourism within the region. Montevideo is home to 
almost half of its national population and counts for more 
than 50% of its national gross domestic product. It has a 
rural area which accounts to approximately 60% of its land 
area.

Montevideo set out to build a vision of the future, taking 
contemporary challenges into account, through a 
prospective planning process to build its strategic plan, 
Montevideo del mañana. This plan is focused on creating a 
vision for the year 2050 as well as creating short, medium 
and long-term guidelines, which are set to be agreed upon 
collectively as a society. It acts as a unique opportunity to 
install a perspective of resilience in the inhabitant’s ways 
of thinking and building the city.

In May 2016, Montevideo was selected to become part of 
the 100 Resilient Cities Network (100RC) promoted by the 
Rockefeller Foundation; a platform aimed at helping cities 
become more resilient to physical, social, economic and 
climate challenges in the 21st century. Thus, its goal is to 
develop a Resilience Strategy that may be integrated into 
Montevideo’s strategic Plan, Montevideo del mañana. 

During 2017, the Resilience Executive Unit was created 
within the Intendancy of Montevideo, responsible for 
leading this process and thus developing a diagnosis and 
an evaluation of the current situation, through collective 
work developed in workshops, expert panels, interviews, 
perception surveys and with the existing data. In October, 
the Preliminary Resilience Assessment was published, 
which summarizes the most relevant impacts and chronic 
stresses, and identifies the Discovery Areas that are to be 
deepened in order to develop the strategy. 

The main challenges identified are as follows: the 
expansion of the urban area and the territorial 
development model; social, economic and territorial 
inequality; mobility and transportation; environmental 

sustainability and waste management; climate change, 
coastal territories and risk management. From this 
diagnosis, work efforts were made to develop the 
strategy, through specific workshops, work meetings and 
consultations. All of this was carried out with the purpose 
of generating both ideas and proposals for intervention.

Montevideo’s resilience strategy is organized into 4 pillars, 
14 objectives, 45 initiatives and 3 strategic processes called 
“resilience laboratories”, which aim to help develop the 
vision of Montevideo’s Resilience.

These pillars address the challenges of resilience, 
providing a long-term vision that defines the assumed 
strategic direction along with a set of objectives aimed at 
achieving this vision.

The 4 pillars are:

A

CONNECTED AND DYNAMIC MONTEVIDEO

B INCLUSIVE AND SUPPORTIVE MONTEVIDEO

C INNOVATIVE AND CO-CREATIVE MONTEVIDEO

D COMMITTED AND PREPARED MONTEVIDEO

The initiatives presented are actions, projects, plans or 
programs which all contribute towards achieving said 
objectives. They include original proposals that came 
out of the work meetings, participatory workshops and 
studies conducted to identify the best ways of addressing 
the challenges posed, to which certain initiatives 
already proposed in other sectoral plans were added, 
either because they directly contribute towards building 

resilience or because they can be enriched if seen through 
a lens of resilience.

These are:

Pillar A includes initiatives aimed at controlling urban 
expansion, promoting the maximum use of consolidated 
areas and revitalizing precarious central areas; to prioritize 
the use of public space for public transportation over 
individual motorized vehicles; as well as initiatives which 
promote the transformation of the energy matrix in relation 
to urban mobility.

Pillar B includes initiatives designed to reverse socio-
spatial segregation and guarantee access to the rights 
of the city; deepen the cultural dimension of urban 
development as a driving force for integration, equality 
and recognition of the diversity of inhabitants; strengthen 
public space as an area for social integration, citizen 
safety and coexistence; and promoting participatory and 
decision-making mechanisms, in a transparent, effective 
and innovative manner.

Pillar C includes initiatives aimed at promoting 
development through prioritizing a circular, social and 
solidarity-based economy; promoting individual and 
collective creativity as a driving force for the innovation 
and development of economic sectors based on 
knowledge, culture and new technologies, and to establish 
Montevideo as an attractive and open city, placing value in 
its cultural, social and natural heritage.

Lastly, Pillar D includes initiatives aimed at promoting 
environmental management that incorporates the 
ecosystem and watershed management approach; 
reducing the impact of solid waste on the environment 
by installing new management systems and the best 
available technologies; giving value to the rural territory, 
promoting the responsible use of its environmental 
services and recognizing the urban-rural complementarity; 
strengthening civic commitment to taking care of the 
environment and improving their abilities in understanding, 
preventing and responding to risk situations from a 
resilient perspective.

The Strategy also proposes 3 resilience laboratories. These 
are not plans or projects, but resilience-building processes 
that, due to their multi-disciplinary characteristics and 
strategic value, allow for an integral approach to the 
4 pillars and decisively contribute towards achieving 
Montevideo’s resilience vision.  

LAB 1: 
TRANSFORMATION OF THE PANTANOSO 
STREAM BASIN

LAB 2: 
INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE COASTAL 
TERRITORY

LAB 3: 
INTEGRAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The transformation of the Pantanoso Stream Basin, a 
socially high vulnerability zone, with precariousness in 
housing and environmental degradation, was classed as a 
laboratory because it presents a multidimensional problem 
that articulates all the strategy pillars within a territory 
considered strategic. 

The coastal territory laboratory addresses the 
multidimensional problems that exist on the coastal front 
of Montevideo, a territory also defined as strategic by 
the Planning Department for Land Use and Sustainable 
Development. This laboratory is aimed at designing and 
implementing a general system for managing the coastal 
space, using integrated coastal management criterions.

The main purpose of the third laboratory is to design 
and implement an integral risk management plan, which 
includes measures of prevention, reduction and risk 
compensation, considering the intersections and synergies 
between disaster risk management and other aspects of 
development, under a human rights approach.

In short, the Resilience Strategy is a tactical and strategic 
guideline that seeks to prepare us, so that we can adapt, 
recover and emerge even stronger in the face of different 
impacts and stresses. It is also a call to action so that we 
can all build a dynamic, attractive, enjoyable, innovative 
and equal Montevideo, with committed and empowered 
citizens in solidarity - in other words, to achieve a resilient 
development of Montevideo.

100 RESILIENT CITIES 
INITIATIVE

The 100 Resilient Cities Network (100RC) is a program 
created in 2013 by the Rockefeller Foundation aimed at 
helping cities around the world to build resilience in the 
face of the physical, social and economic challenges of 
the 21st century, whose complexities are increasing in a 
progressively interconnected world.

Each city has its own characteristics that shape its identity, 
but even so, there are common challenges that can be 
identified in the vast majority of them. For this reason, 
the network not only collaborates with cities individually, 
but also facilitates creating a global resilient development 
practice that promotes cooperation through the exchange 
of good practices and experiences.

Montevideo joined 100RC in May of 2016. Its 
incorporation into the network represents an 
international recognition of the work carried out; but 
it also demonstrates the commitment of the city to 
address, from a new perspective, the challenges 
that have not yet been solved and that hold 
immense opportunities of growth and development.

Being part of the network allows access to specialized 
technical assistance, methodological support, analytical 
tools and specialized services in urban resilience, as well 
as having financial resources, which allows having a 
specialized office that promotes the resilience agenda of 
the city. But above all, it offers the opportunity to be part of 
a global network of cities, being able to exchange 
experiences under a scope of mutual inspiration 
and collaboration.

CITY RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK

URBAN RESILIENCE

The challenges facing the 21st century cities derive from 
patterns of global change, including changes in political 
and economic models, social and cultural fractures, 
changes in weather patterns, stresses and conflicts over 
the use of territory and the use of natural resources. All of 
these elements, within a high interacting local and global 
environment, which further multiplies the uncertainty 
surrounding the future. 

The resilience approach, when applied to the development 
of urban territories, incorporates a different way of 
addressing these challenges. It considers both the abrupt 
changes (a consequence of shocks) and the gradual 
changes (a consequence of underlying stresses), as well 
as the interactions that are generated between both. In 
other words, it focuses on change and bets on developing 
its managing capacities, to positively take advantage of it 
for the benefit of a more sustainable development.

The Resilient Cities Framework1, developed by 100RC, 
takes particular care of urban complexity by integrating, 
through a holistic approach, all aspects concerning 
territorial development. It is made up of 4 dimensions, 12 
resilience drive factors and 50 indicators, which all help 
in the understanding of every city’s processes that are 
associated with building resilience.

This conceptual framework was applied whilst building 
this strategy, as a lens to diagnose weaknesses and 
to identify opportunities for strengthening resilience 
in Montevideo, and as a systematization, tool to better 
understand the origin of current changes and respond 
more effectively in the face of future challenges.

Urban resilience is the ability 
of people, communities, 
institutions, companies and 
systems that make up a city, to 
adapt, grow and thrive in face 
of chronic shocks and stresses 
that can weaken its structure 
and affect its operation. It 
is the capacity of a city to 
permanently improve for the 
benefit of all its citizens.

MAIN RESILIENCE 
CHALLENGES

Montevideo has an area of 530 square kilometers and 
is the smallest department in Uruguay, but it is also its 
capital; it is home to almost half of the population and 
where more than 50% of the national GDP is generated.2 
These characteristics, together with its status of being 
the country’s main port and one of the most important 
on the south Atlantic coast, render it as geopolitically and 
economically strategic. That is why its resilience capacity 
acquires a fundamental relevance, not only at the local 
level, but also in the national and regional context. 

During the preliminary resilience3 assessment (PRA), 
a collective identification of the most relevant shocks 
and chronic stresses for the city was made, based on 
the statistical analysis of the data available (in pre-
existing studies) and in a study of perceptions specifically 
conducted to complete the diagnosis. These results 
were systematized under the resilience approach and 
were exposed in collective debates that allowed for 
the establishing of links, similarities and cause-effect 
relationships, that were sometimes unthinkable or hardly 
known. This allowed the main challenges in building 
resilience to be identified.

The challenges identified, which are explained and 
developed below, do not constitute an exhaustive list, but 
they form the basis that sustained the development of this 
strategy. The constantly changing conditions that underlie 
21st century transformations, and the very definition of 
resilience, implies maintaining permanent and continuous 
attention to identify new shocks and stresses in the future.

the designed land management tools have not had the 
expected results on land speculation and on reversing 
the expansion process. This is either because they are 
difficult to apply, since the regulatory process has not been 
completed or because their conceptual foundations and 
action protocols are not clearly defined and diffused. 

The unnecessary growth of the urban fabric, which 
requires maintaining low residential densities, not only 
implies an inefficient use of the urban territory’s assets 
and a considerable increase in the cost of land (limiting 
the access to it from a large part of the population), but 
also implies an unnecessary pressure on natural resources 
and traditional rural activities, thus generating land use 
conflicts, especially in the urban-rural interface.

Increasing Montevideo’s resilience means capitalizing on 
its powerful installed endowment, building a more efficient 
territory, where the available assets in the consolidated city 
are used to overcome inequities in the use and enjoyment 
of urban habitat quality, interacting harmoniously with its 
productive and rural natural environment.

CHALLENGE 2:
SOCIAL, ECONOMIC 
AND TERRITORIAL 
INEQUALITY

Both the country and Montevideo were affected by major 
institutional or economic crises in the 70s, 80s and early 
2000s. At the national level and at the departmental level, 
policies have been applied that have managed to revert, 
in general terms, the economic inequities generated by 
these crises. For example, in Montevideo, the percentage 
of poor households fell from 26% in 2006 to 8.3% in 
2016.4 However, it has not been possible to overcome the 
territorial segregation that followed the urban expansion 
processes associated with these crises.

Socio-territorial segregation (social segmentation and 
territorial fragmentation) implies generating locations with 
internal social homogeneity and little social interaction 
between them, characterized by strong asymmetries in 
their urban qualities, their equipment and infrastructure, 
the qualification and public use of space, housing solutions 
and its inhabitants access to the city’s5 resources.

According to data for the year 2011, 26.8%6 of Montevideo’s 
population has at least one unsatisfied basic need (NBI)7, 
which is mainly concentrated in unconsolidated areas, 
particularly along major roadways and watercourses, 
as well as in some slums in central areas. In these 
neighbourhoods, the population with unsatisfied basic 
needs reaches between 40 and 60%.

This situation demonstrates a territorialized expression of 
social inequality, which becomes even more complex if one 
considers the age dimension of this population (between 
40-60% of children under 14 years of age in non-central 
neighbourhoods have at least one NBI) and the ethnic 
background (45% of the Afro-descendant population has at 
least one NBI).

In this context, one of the most important stresses that 
emerged in the preliminary resilience assessment is the 
lack of social cohesion. This is not only linked to territorial 
segregation. The recognition and respect for the diversity 
of all the inhabitants becomes fundamental in building 
resilience; from rural workers to the migrant population, 
considering age, gender and socioeconomic differences.

CHALLENGE 1:
EXPANSION OF THE URBAN 
AREA AND TERRITORIAL 
DEVELOPMENT MODEL

The urban growth of Montevideo is extensive and is 
carried out in low demographic pressure conditions. Even 
though the population had a negative growth in the last 
two intercensal periods (1996 -2004 - 2011), remaining 
practically stable for more than 20 years, the expansion of 
urban land has been constant since the middle of the last 
century. This gives the department a population density 
of just 25 inhabitants per hectare, which amounts to 70 
inhabitants per hectare if considering only the urban land.
The institutional and economic crisis that affected the 
country in the mid-70s and early 80s sharpened the 
territorial expansion and population expulsion processes 
from the consolidated city. This led to the precariousness 
of some sectors, in which a provision of high quality urban 
services and equipment (that is underutilized) and a stock 
of about 2,000 abandoned houses is maintained.

Faced with this situation, Montevideo has been developing 
an important strategy in territorial planning since the 
1990s, and since 1998 it has a Land-Use Planning (POT) 
and several sectorial plans, making them pioneers on the 
issue at a national and regional level. However, some of

CHALLENGE 3:
MOBILITY AND 
TRANSPORTATION

The results of the preliminary resilience assessment 
indicate that mobility is one of the most relevant stresses 
perceived by the citizens of Montevideo. The urban 
mobility system not only enables the movement of people 
and goods, but also plays a key role in social inclusion and 
contributes to the democratic appropriation of the city.

The urban expansion process led to the emptying of the 
central areas and making the population locate along 
the main road corridors, generating greater dependence 
on individual displacements and a greater demand for 
collective public transportation to peripheral areas of the 
city. Likewise, the socio-territorial segregation (generated 
because of this expansion) led to a neighbourhood logic 
with low interaction between themselves and with 
difficulties in accessing those areas with better habitat 
qualification.

urban fabric and the consequent impact on the flow and 
local safety traffic. In addition, its status as the main urban 
center of the metropolitan area implies that approximately 
22% of trips within Montevideo are originated in the 
metropolitan area.8

Alongside these processes is the considerable vehicle 
fleet increase in Montevideo and the fact that sustainable 
mobility means have not yet found an adequate and 
attractive alternative for their development: although in 
short-distance trips, transportation by foot has a high 
prevalence, in medium and long trips, the growth of 
motorized transportation has been accentuated, with the 
predominance of the individual private vehicle.

Montevideo has advanced in the search for solutions 
based on applying technologies, among which, the 
creation of the Metropolitan Transportation System and 
the Mobility Management Center stand out. However, 
deepening mobility and connectivity policies still remains 
an important challenge in line with the planning processes 
and the observed territorial dynamics. 

The role of Montevideo as the national capital and as the 
country’s main port has also generated in recent years, 
under a context of sustained national economic growth, 
an increase in the pressure of freight transportation in the 

Montevideo’s mobility system is an essential instrument 
for qualifying and consolidating centralities, making the 
city’s public facilities accessible for collective use while at 
the same time promoting democratic ownership of it. 

CHALLENGE 4:
ENVIRONMENTAL 
SUSTAINABILITY AND 
WASTE MANAGEMENT

The dynamics of unplanned urban expansion have 
impacted the department’s natural resources generating 
several environmental problems and conflicts: the 
territorial regression of rural areas and the degradation of 
productive agricultural land, the contamination of water 
resources, the loss of biodiversity and the affectation of 
fragile ecosystems mainly associated with rivers and 
streams.

62% of Montevideo’s department territory is rural and 
despite its low population concentration, it plays a 
fundamental role in producing vegetables and fruits for 
internal consumption. Its importance, however, goes 
beyond its productive value; rural producers have a small-
scale production system that generates a characteristic 
cultural landscape, associated with Montevideo’s rural 
identity.

In addition, it constitutes a green space located in the 
metropolitan area, which plays a vital role from an 
environmental, landscape and recreational point of view. 
It is an area with ecological and environmental values of 
great significance, such as the Santa Lucia river wetlands 
(today it is a protected area which entered the National 
System of Protected Areas) and the west coast of Río de la 
Plata that still maintains high naturalness values.

The environmental degradation problems also occur 
in the urban and suburban areas of Montevideo. In 
this case, waste management is one of the aspects in 
which the perception analysis carried out reflected the 
sensitivity of the people of Montevideo, mainly because it 
is associated with the contamination of the department’s 
water resources. Informal settlements on its banks cause 
contamination of the water, both by the direct discharge of 
household effluents, as well as by playing a receptor role 
in clandestine classification points and in informal waste 
disposal.

It is necessary to address environmental stresses and 
conflicts with a multiscale and multi-territorial approach; 
it is especially important to consider the basin scale water 
resources to help achieve an integrated management of 
problems and solutions.

CHALLENGE 5:
CLIMATE CHANGE, 
COASTAL TERRITORIES 
AND RISK MANAGEMENT

In the preliminary resilience assessment, 3 relevant 
shocks for the city were identified, all linked to climate 
variability and climate change: severe storms (winds and 
heavy rains) and their direct consequences: flooding by 
rain and collapse of houses, woodland and infrastructures. 
These shocks affect the entire department but acquire 
special significance in relation to the territories linked to 
the department’s bodies of water.

The coast of Rio de la Plata is of great importance for all 
the people of Montevideo, not only for its symbolic value 
as the main democratic space for coexistence, but also for 
its economic relevance: its 20 km of beaches constitute 
a landscape and heritage value that contribute to 
Montevideo’s status as the main tourist destination in the 
country. Likewise, it houses the country’s main port, being 
Uruguay’s entry and exit door for trade. 

The continuous impacts due to extreme weather events 
has led to sand losses from its beaches, changes in its 
coastal dynamics, affecting its main marine and terrestrial 
ecosystems, and increasing the affection risks of strategic 

infrastructures located on the coast (a power plant, an oil 
refinery, port facilities, urban sanitation facilities) and of 
an important stock of houses (the coastal neighbourhoods 
are the most densely populated and house 20% of the 
department’s population).

The main urban water courses (Pantanoso, Miguelete 
and Carrasco streams) are also affected by the effects 
of climatic variability, especially the frequency and 
intensity of rainfall, whose impact increases because of 
uncontrolled urban development in potentially flood-prone 
areas.

Over the years, an important institutional capacity 
response to disaster events has been built, through the 
actions of the Departmental Emergency Coordinating 
Center (CECOED) and the implementation of sectoral 
policies by various agencies (for example, relocation 
of housing that is located in flood areas or the 
implementation of successive drainage and sanitation 
plans, among others). However, in many cases, these 
sectoral actions are not identified, neither by the officials 
themselves nor by citizens in general, as initiatives linked 
to risk management. It is necessary to strengthen the 
risk perception, whether related to climate activity or not, 
and to build an integrated and contemporary prevention, 
mitigation, preparation, emergency care, rehabilitation and 
recovery approach.

EMERGING CHALLENGE: 
TRANSFORMATION OF   
THE PRODUCTIVE MATRIX

Although the potential impacts of technological 
transformation on the automation of employment 
were not identified as relevant during the preliminary 
resilience assessment, this is an issue that is being 
intensively debated at the public level in the country. In 
fact, the transformation of the productive matrix is one 
of the five prioritized dimensions in building the National 
Development Strategy for 2050 that is carried out by the 
Office for Planning and Budget (OPP) of the country’s 
Presidency, and one of the seven debate topics of the 
Montevideo del mañana plan, which is being carried out by 
the Intendancy of Montevideo.

To highlight this national challenge, the OPP has developed 
a prospective study9 to provide elements for social 
reflection and for designing public policies on the subject. 
From investigations conducted on a global scale, this 
study recognises the emergence of a sixth technological 
revolution since 2010 (based on the digital revolution), 
which is applied to renewable energies, biotechnology 

and nanotechnology, and characterized by sustainable 
development and the promotion of the circular economy.
The results obtained confirm that Uruguay is not isolated 
from the effects of labour market automation. The 
activities with the greatest risk of automation represented 
16% of the jobs in 2015 and play a fundamental role in 
the country’s exports value chain. However, in recent 
years, the intensity of cognitive tasks has indeed grown in 
Uruguay, which are more difficult to automate. That is to 
say, the country is in a useful position to take advantage 
of the technological revolution by modifying its productive 
matrix, without generating a technological unemployment 
increase.

For this reason, the 2050 development strategy places 
focus on the prospective planning of 6 productive 
complexes that are considered to be strategic. Montevideo 
must face this challenge and accompany this national 
policy, all the while enhancing its own strengths to boost 
its prioritized production complexes: digital economy 
(TICs, electronics, robotics, artificial intelligence, internet of 
things, communications), tourism, creative industries and 
global service exports, betting on developing professional, 
scientific and technical activities, linked to creative and 
innovative thinking and interpersonal skills.

APPROACH 
ADOPTED FOR 
THE STRATEGY 
CONSTRUCTION

Montevideo’s resilience strategy 
is being compiled in an integrated 
manner with other planning 
development processes that are 
occurring simultaneously, both at 
departmental and national levels. In 
its elaboration, this unique situation 
of convergence is exploited by 
evaluating other planning processes, 
learning from them and giving them 
feedback. Therefore, maintaining 
coherence with what has been 
done and, thus, generating a 
profound impact by incorporating a 
resilience approach when planning a 
sustainable development.

The resilience strategy values 
Montevideo’s planning tradition   

Montevideo has a long tradition in participatory planning 
management . Even though the term ‘resilience’ has been 
incorporated only very recently within Montevideo’s action 
framework, the concept, in its broad sense, has been 
underlying in several planning processes: from territorial 
planning to housing relocation programs in flood-prone 
zones; and similarly, from successive urban sanitation 
plans to public space policy prioritization (as a privileged 
area for social integration). However, it is necessary to 
integrate the concept transversally and medullary to 
the strategic planning processes of the city, so that it 
permeates all of its management areas.

The resilience strategy is based on Montevideo’s planning 
tradition. It recognizes the initiatives that have already 
been carried out and relates them to identifying the 
emerging benefits of joint implementation; it complements 
them when necessary with a new perspective and 
integrates them into a new agenda designed to manage 
change under a resilience approach.

The resilience strategy is 
integrated into the Montevideo 
del mañana development process

The beginning of the resilience strategy building process 
coincided with the department’s prospective planning 
process, Montevideo del mañana, destined to build a 
long-term development (2050) vision and guide to the 
short, medium and long-term actions that are necessary 
for its realization. 

The UER participates as a key actor in this process, 
maintaining a permanent exchange of ideas, concepts 
and proposals: the inspiring 2050 vision of Montevideo 
del mañana was built simultaneously alongside the 
resilience vision; its strategic axes were aligned with 
the resilience pillars; and the key debate topics for 
Montevideo del mañana were the subject of special 
study in the resilience strategy, in order to provide new 
inputs for building broad social agreements.

In this context, the development of the resilience 
strategy within the 100RC framework constitutes a 
unique opportunity to install the resilience perspective 
not only in Montevideo’s process Montevideo del 
mañana, but also in the inhabitant’s ways of thinking 
and building the city. And, at the same time, it serves as 
a challenge to optimize the use of the methodological 
tools in both processes, avoiding duplicating efforts and 
ensuring coherence in the results. 

The resilience strategy capitalizes 
Montevideo’s role in the 
sustainable development of the 
country

The resilience strategy development process also 
coincides with Uruguay’s National Development Strategy 
for 2050 building process, which seeks to collectively 
reflect on the Uruguay of the future, generating a 
consensual vision of the country and defining the strategic 
guidelines to achieve it. 

Montevideo, as a capital city, is a strategic territory, 
recipient and executor of national policies that are defined 
within that framework, and therefore must address 
challenges that transcend its powers and responsibilities. 
To do this, it must prepare itself to accompany the 
implementation of the government’s national policies 
without losing its own identity and long-term development 
vision. Thus, several initiatives included in this strategy are 
led by national institutions and Montevideo accepts them 
as playing a key role in leading actions in its territory. In 
this respect, the resilience value that is built in Montevideo 
is amplified and generates positive impacts on building 
resilience at a national level.

STRUCTURE OF 
THE STRATEGY

HOW TO READ THE STRATEGY

RESILIENCE VALUE: 
It indicates how the action contributes to building 
resilience by referring to the indicators of the  
City Resilience Framework.

Montevideo’s resilience strategy is organised into 4 pillars, 
14 objectives, 45 initiatives and 3 strategic processes that 
we have called «resilience laboratories». Together, these 
pillars, objectives, initiatives and laboratories all contribute 
to building Montevideo’s Resilient vision.

The pillars address, in a systematic and comprehensive 
manner, the main challenges identified in the preliminary 
assessment of resilience, taking into account the vision, 
development axes’ and Montevideo’s future debate topics 
in the prospective planning process of Montevideo del 
mañana. Each pillar has a long-term vision that defines the 
strategic assumed direction and a set of objectives that 
are aimed at achieving this vision.

The initiatives are actions, projects, plans or programs 
that contribute to achieving the objectives. Whilst each 
initiative is associated with a particular objective, they 
were also selected for their value, as they multiply the 

value of resilience; as a result, they also contribute directly 
or indirectly to achieve other objectives of the same or of 
different pillars. The list of 45 initiatives includes original 
proposals that came out of working groups, participatory 
workshops and studies conducted in order to identify the 
best ways to address Montevideo’s resilience challenges, 
to which others of the Intendancy’s sectoral plans were 
included, either because they directly contribute to building 
resilience or because they can be enriched if the resilience 
lens is incorporated.

Laboratories are neither plans nor projects nor actions. 
These are resilience building processes that due to their 
transversality and strategic value characteristics, allow 
for an integral approach to the 4 pillars and contribute 
towards achieving Montevideo’s Resilient vision in a 
decisive manner.

CONNECTED AND DYNAMIC 
MONTEVIDEO

Montevideo is a dynamic city that is connected to the 
world, the region and its metropolitan environment. 
It is one which makes efficient use of its territory 
and of its installed capacities, supported by an urban 
mobility system that guarantees adequate connectivity, 
combining different transportation means and 
prioritizing sustainability, promoting socio-territorial 
integration processes and equitable use of the territory 
for all of the people of Montevideo.

A1.2 
RECOVERY OF ABANDONED 
BUILDINGS IN CENTRAL AREAS

The objective of the program is to recover abandoned 
buildings and reestablish them as spaces enabled for 
multiple uses, including residential use, either temporarily 
or permanently. It is supported by departmental 
regulations and legal tools available under Law No. 18,308 
on land use planning and sustainable development.

From a pilot scheme, the recovery of visibly abandoned 
sites and buildings will be put into practice in the 
central area of Montevideo, which includes investigating 
the property registry, the necessary legal process for 
expropriating the property and its incorporation (through 
an agreement with the MVOTMA, destined for accessing 
housing programs implemented by the national 
government). Based on the pilot experience, the possibility 
of allocating special funds for the physical rehabilitation of 
the buildings to be used for non-residential uses and on a 
temporary basis, will be evaluated.

By 2019, 30 abandoned buildings that are in the process 
of being incorporated into national housing programs will 
have been recovered. By 2020, an intervention protocol 
for the recovery and rehabilitation of abandoned buildings 
will be validated and institutionalized, in accordance with 
national and departmental regulations.

A1.1 
INSTRUMENT SYSTEM FOR LAND 
MANAGEMENT 

Montevideo currently has a set of management 
instruments and territorial regulations that facilitate 
access to the land. Despite having the support of these 
instruments, their application has not been able to 
contribute efficiently to optimize land use, facilitate 
its access in an equitable manner nor direct urban 
interventions towards building the desired compact city 
model.

The initiative consists of revising the existing instruments 
and designing and activating an easy-to-apply territory 
management tool system that adjusts to the dynamics 
of the current real estate market and that contributes to 
channeling the use of urban land in an efficient manner. 
Among the instruments to be reviewed includes the 
land portfolio, right of first refusal, expropriation, surface 
rights and the promotion of instruments, incentives and 
disincentives for private action. 

Articulation with national policies. This initiative is 
developed within the framework agreement signed 
by the Intendancy of Montevideo with the Ministry of 

Housing, Territorial Planning and Environment (MVOTMA) 
to join forces and coordinate actions to move towards a 
National Strategy for Access to Urban Land (ENASU). This 

agreement will allow Montevideo to pool its experience 

with other departmental governments and with the 

national government to trigger a general improvement in 
the instrument system at a national level, thus multiplying 

the resilience value of the initiative.

REVALUATION OF URBAN 
CENTRALITIES

It is a set of actions designed with the aim of promoting 
the revaluation of pre-existing urban centers and 
strengthening new centralities that are intended to be 
consolidated. These actions involve both infrastructure 
works, either new works or physical requalification, 
and regulation adjustments related to urban surplus 
value appropriation instruments aimed at redirecting 
investments from public and private sectors to ensure the 
best use of the territory and to allow for socio-territorial 
integration. By 2020, the following interventions will have 
been carried out:

Extension of the Parque de la amistad and 
Modernisation of the Planetarium
Recovery of public space linked with the current zoo, 
which will result in a 100% accessible, illuminated and 
landscaped space, complete with playgrounds and active 
spaces. The zoo will be transformed into an eco-park 
and the planetarium will be modernised by renovating 
the building and installing a high-tech digital projection 
system.

Italia avenue roadway Corridor
Physical infrastructure adaptation works to improve the 
flow of public transportation, conditioning of sidewalks, 
redefining construction parameters on the roadway 
corridor and designing specific urban value instruments 
for appropriating the surplus generated, aimed at 
strengthening the central role of Italia avenue on an urban 
and metropolitan scale.

Mercado Modelo
From an open contest of ideas came a programmatic and 
architectural proposal for the urban development of the 
old Mercado Modelo and its immediate surroundings, 
barycenter of Montevideo, which is currently vacant due to 
its move to the new Food Unit of Montevideo.

Montevideo has a 2010-2020 Mobility Plan that will be 
subject to revision and adjustments in accordance with 
the current dynamics of Montevideo’s territory and of the 
metropolitan area. At the time of this review, the resilience 
approach will be incorporated in order to enhance the role 
of urban mobility as a catalyst for the efficient use of the 
territory and the democratic appropriation of the city. 

In particular, a strategy will be designed for transforming 
the public transportation system to a metropolitan scale, 
based on efficiency and principles of quality. This proposal 
will include reviewing the institutional framework and 
current regulatory aspects, as well as design, planning and 
management aspects.

REQUALIFICATION OF SPACES FOR 
PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC 

The Mobility Management Center is a service composed 
of several intelligent transportation systems that are 
applied to the administration, management, traffic control 
and transportation of the city of Montevideo. It possesses 
technological equipment that allows for the acquisition of 
a large volume of high complexity data in real time and on 
the flow, as well as the transit status in the city.

The objective of this initiative is to improve the institutional 
technical capacities for the better use and utilization of 
data (Big Data) in planning and supervising the mobility 
system. The planned actions include: analysis of existing 
capacities; generating new capabilities for data analysis; 
and developing specific techniques for using and 
applying Big Data when making decisions related to the 
optimization of mobility.

By 2020, at least three cases using the platform’s data 
(compiled in the Mobility Management Center) will have 
been developed to improve specific aspects of the public 
transportation system.

This project will be implemented as part of a future 
comprehensive intervention aimed at designing pedestrian 
circuits in the city and will involve the combined effort 
of the Intendancy of Montevideo and public schools, 
students, parents and neighbors. It consists of designing 
neighbourhood pedestrian circuits connected between 
each public school and to the public transportation stops 
of its immediate surroundings, aimed at promoting safe 
pedestrian transportation for schoolchildren. Likewise, 
digital tools will be used to map the routes and to diffuse 
data in the user network.

The project will initially be implemented as a pilot 
scheme in selected neighbourhoods. By 2019, at 
least one pedestrian circuit will be implemented and 
evaluated to define the feasibility of replicating it in other 
neighbourhoods of Montevideo.

The country’s consolidated change of its energy 
matrix towards the predominant use of renewable 
energies generates a unique opportunity to promote the 
transformation of the energy matrix in transportation. For 
Montevideo, this opportunity has the greatest potential 
regarding collective public transportation, because of the 
intensive use of these components, and because of the 
possibility of introducing electromobility on a massive 
scale due to the direct incidence capacity through 
departmental public policy.

The initiative involves the direct acquisition of 80 electric 
units for collective public transportation in Montevideo, 
and the joint implementation with the national government 
of a subsidy for these types of vehicles when purchased by 
third parties. The transformation process will be gradual 
due to the initial investment costs and the necessary 
adjustments to the complementary equipment, rules 
and regulations, and the necessary inter-institutional 
coordination. By 2020, 5% of Montevideo’s public 
transportation fleet will correspond to electric vehicles.

Articulation with national policies. Montevideo participates in 
the inter-institutional group formed by the Ministry of Industry, 

Energy and Mining (MIEM), the Ministry of Transportation 

and Public Works (MTOP), the Ministry of Housing, Territorial 

Planning and the Environment (MVOTMA), the Ministry 
of Economy and Finance (MEF), UTE, ANCAP and other 

municipalities of the country, dedicated to researching and 
developing the potential use of electric vehicles, particularly 
focused on public transportation. In this respect, it capitalizes 
on the interdisciplinary knowledge generated at the national 

level and leads it towards implementing departmental 

policies aimed at improving the quality of Montevideo’s public 
transportation service, incorporating a resilience perspective.

With the aim of promoting a change in the individual 
transportation energy matrix, a set of actions targeting 
both the public and private sectors is put forward. The 
planned actions include:

 · Reconversion of Montevideo’s taxi fleet to electric 

vehicles, through a gradual process of incentives and 
allows for a replacement in the renovation phase.

 · A set of measures aimed at promoting the use of private 

electric vehicles, which include: defining parking areas 
for electric vehicles in public spaces; installing charging 
points in public spaces; adapting building regulations 
to facilitate the availability of vehicle loading facilities in 
private buildings. 

 · Support private initiatives regarding the electric 

car sharing service by implementing the previous 
set of measures that have been adjusted to these 
undertakings.

By 2020, 10% of Montevideo’s taxi fleet will correspond to 
electric vehicles and the city will have 40 parking points 
dedicated to electric vehicles.

INSPIRATION FROM THE 100RC NETWORK: Wellington 
City
The city of Wellington promotes the widespread use of 
electric vehicles (EVs) as a way of reducing dependence 
on the vulnerable supply chain of fuel, as well as the 
carbon footprint. The action taken starts with the example 
of the City Council, through: a) the gradual replacement 
of the own fleet while it is necessary to establish the 
replacement and b) the preference on its policy of public 
purchases to those contractors that use electric vehicles. 
Likewise, it supports the use of these vehicles in the 
private sector or other public sectors, by investing in the 
charging infrastructure in different points of the city and in 
charging infrastructure in private buildings.

CHACARITA STREAM BASIN LAND 
PLANNING 

The Chacarita stream basin is one of the three strategic 
zones defined by Montevideo’s Planning Departmental 
Guidelines. It is considered to be part of the department’s 
urban-rural interface and has a high complexity due to 
the socio-territorial segregation issue, the precariousness 
of the habitat, the loss of environmental services and the 
existing stresses between the different activities that 
coexist alongside the housing issue: agriculture, industry, 
the city’s final waste disposal site and the model prison 
Punta de Rieles, among others.

The partial territorial planning, as a legally binding tool, 
will establish the guidelines for a harmonious occupation 
of the territory and will further guide the dynamics of the 
current and future urban processes for building social 
cohesion, reversing environmental deterioration and 
integrating the basin with other sectors of the territory.

B1.1  
REQUALIFICATION OF INFORMAL 
SETTLEMENT HABITAT AREAS

An integral intervention for improving informal 
settlement habitat areas is a process that involves a set 
of transformations that will enable the provision and 
improvement of urban infrastructure and community 
facilities, as well as advocate the improvement of the 
social and environmental conditions of neighbourhoods 
and houses. The Intendancy of Montevideo, the 
municipalities and the MVOTMA are already implementing 
the Neighbourhood Improvement Program in a coordinated 
fashion, through regularization processes, providing basic 
infrastructure and relocating the population. 

With an objective to increase the integrality of the 
intervention, the Intendancy of Montevideo’s specific 
action is added to this process, which involves creating 
public spaces, reclassifying spaces previously occupied 
by informal settlements and building new urban fronts for 
integrating other sectors of the city. Likewise, articulation 
with national public policies that are present in the same 
territory (health, education, safety, social development) is 
promoted to guarantee the optimization of resources and 
the generation of a greater impact in poverty reduction and 
in social integration. By 2020, comprehensive interventions 
will have been completed in 6 informal settlements in 
different municipalities of Montevideo.

neighbourhood communities by promoting democratic 
access to health, culture and sports, supported by 
community participation. Montevideo developed the first 
complex in 2010, which has had positive feedback from the 
community and the institutions that work in building its 
programmatic content.

This new complex, which will be located in Flor de 
Maroñas, F Municipality, consists of the refurbishment 
and extension of an existing theater in order to build a 
complex that includes: a sports and related services area; 
a multi-purpose room; a classroom; a workshop room, a 
mini-theater and multi-purpose rooms. It will constitute a 
physical space that will house inter-institutional dialogue 
spaces, promoting the decentralization of activities in the

DIFFUSION OF MONTEVIDEO’S 
NEIGHBOURHOODS HERITAGE 
VALUES 

The main objective of the Culture at the Corner program 
is to develop culture with a territorial proximity to 
Montevideo’s neighbourhoods. It stems from the premise 
of advocating the citizens’ right to art and culture, but 
from a perspective that it should be collectively built from 
enjoyment, joy and the neighbour’s prominence, who have 
a say in deciding what is done.

This initiative sets up specific cultural interventions, 
promoting a variety of artistic disciplines and also runs 
workshops that are designed by firstly recognizing and 
valuing what already exists in each neighbourhood. The 
aim is to strengthen individual skills when relating to 
others in a nonviolent and coexistent environment. Its 
focus is placed on recognizing diversity, which is reflected 
in imploring the participation of multiple generations, 
as well as including people with different skills and 
integrating migrants as a means of diffusing their own 
culture.

In the preliminary resilience assessment, a key source 
of socio-urban stress was pinpointed as being the lack 
of knowledge possessed by the people of Montevideo 
on the cultural values that are present in the different 
neighbourhoods of their city and in turn, the citizen’s 
consequent difficulty of identifying with their city. Each 
neighbourhood has its own identity, resources and 
cultural values that can be used to reinforce the sense of 
belonging by the people of Montevideo and therefore can 
develop social capital for the neighbourhood communities. 
The valorization of these multiple identities contributes 
towards building a more socially and territorially integrated 
Montevideo.

The initiative proposes campaigns aimed at diffusing and 
valuing the tangible and intangible heritage capital of 
each neighbourhood, so that residents are able to connect 
with each other, with their neighbourhood and with their 
city. Each campaign will be designed according to the 
neighbourhoods characteristics and the specific values 
to be promoted, and may include workshops, citizen 
laboratories, tourist circuits unravelling local heritage, 
cultural interventions in public spaces and emblematic 
buildings, talks in schools and zonal centers. By 2019, at 
least 2 events will have been carried out, both focused on 
diffusing and valuing the neighbourhood heritage assets of 
Montevideo.

This initiative focuses on the conditioning of public spaces 
at different scales to achieve complementary objectives: 
neighbourhood-scale squares that represent areas for 
violence-free coexistence of neighbours, and urban-scale 
parks, as areas for social integration and exchanges 
between neighbours hailing from Montevideo’s different 
neighbourhoods. These physical conditioning interventions 
or recovery of spaces are made in accordance with the 
strategies developed collectively by the Intendancy and the 
municipalities framework, as a means of strengthening 
socio-territorial inclusion and coexistence, through actions 
that generate conditions that may deepen democratic 
exchange.

According to the requirements of each case, improvements 
will be made to existing infrastructures, providing 
children’s games, health-oriented games, smart lighting, 
street furnishings, public access to wi-fi and surveillance 
cameras. By 2020, 7 squares at a neighbourhood scale 
(Las Pioneras square, Integradora Instrucciones square 
and Antillas, Plaza de Deportes No. 1, Leguizamo square, 
Libertad de Maroñas square, Larocca square, plaza de la

Montevideo stands out for its strong policy on prioritizing 
public spaces as privileged areas for social integration, 
citizen safety and coexistence. It is one of its better 
recognised strengths and is valued highly by the people 
of Montevideo. This successful proficiency offers a unique 
opportunity to develop a strategy that can contribute to 
cementing the role of public space as a fundamental factor 
in building resilience. 

This initiative aims to systematize the good practices 
that have already been developed and incorporate new 
guidelines to guide the design, building, maintenance, 
use management and governance of public spaces, 
from a resilient perspective. The guide will have a 
multidimensional approach to public space, incorporating 
guidelines that range from the physical design of resilient 
public spaces to climate change aspects (use of plant 
species for conserving biodiversity, green infrastructures, 
permeable pavements, etc.). It also includes the design 
and provision of equipment aimed at promoting the use, 
accessibility and residents’ permanency in safe conditions, 
as well as strategies for generating programmatic 
content for their enjoyment, financing strategies, forms of 
governance and integral management processes that will 
allow for a constant evaluation of the needs, attitudes and 
appropriation forms of users to achieve a continuous and 
systematized improvement.

debates, generate and present project initiatives that seek 
to improve their lives, as well as participate in surveys 
and even interview the Mayor and his government team. 
Montevideo Decide aims to promote and create a culture 
of direct citizen participation through digital media, which 
enables anyone who is interested in generating change to 
have the means of doing so.

Through this platform, ideas for the co-creation of 
initiatives that contribute to increasing Montevideo’s 
resilience can be debated. In this way, not only is active 
participation encouraged, but it also contributes to the 
generation of knowledge and information on the concept 
of urban resilience and its relevance to the territory’s 
sustainable development. By 2019, at least 3 discussion 
topics will have been installed, all linked to the key 
challenges of building resilience in the Montevideo Decide 
platform.

The MVD Lab is a physical and digital space dedicated to 
facilitating exchange, interaction and innovation between 
citizens and their government. It is conceived as a citizen 
laboratory for the production, experimentation and 
diffusion of innovative projects that are aimed at creating 
new and better solutions to the challenges posed by the 
city. Citizen innovation is the innovation that stems from 
people and is aimed at the people to improve society and 
areas of coexistence, knowledge and action.

The objective of this initiative is to introduce the concept 
of innovation with a resilient focus on the different topics 
that are addressed by the MVD Labs, either in general 
instances convened around different topics or by proposing 
specific debates regarding solutions for resilience (MVD 
Lab - Montevideo Resilient Edition). By 2019, an MVD Lab 
Montevideo Resilient Edition will be implemented within 
the Montevideo del mañana framework. By 2020, an MVD 
Lab Montevideo Resilient Edition will be implemented, 
linked to resilience and risk management.

C1.2  
REUSE CENTERS NETWORK 

Through this initiative, based on the circular principle 
of maintaining products, components and materials 
at their highest level and highest durability, it seeks to 
reduce generating avoidable household wastes, extend 
the useful life of electrical and electronic equipment, 
furniture, textiles, toys and other objects; and find 
new users for repaired items, provide employment 
opportunities for people with traditional trades and offer 
learning opportunities in repairing and in basic aspects of 
traditional trades to any interested citizen.

This initiative aims to promote the creation of a network 
of reuse, repair and rental centers for disused objects, 
accessible to the public. This initiative will be framed under 
the supporting policies and instruments carried out by the 
Intendancy, who assists the development of medium and 
small-sized enterprises, and will consist of implementing 
specific events into incubator programs, workshops, 
academic mentoring and financing. Likewise, the creation 
of an exchange platform between initiatives to strengthen 
links and consolidate the network will be promoted. By 
2019, at least 3 instances will be implemented that are 
specifically dedicated to developing projects committed 
to the reuse and repair of disused objects, within the 
supporting policy for medium and small-sized companies 
framework.

C1.1  
BOOST TO THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY

A circular city incorporates the circular economy principles 
through all of its functions, with the aim of forming a 
territorial regenerative system, accessible and redundant 
by design. Montevideo aims to build the necessary bases 
to achieve a transition towards this type of economy, 
deepening the study of its potentialities, developing new 
technologies from its digital infrastructure availability and 
designing support tools for entrepreneurs so that they can 
achieve self-sustainability within this business model.

This initiative consists of designing an institutional 
strategy to promote innovative processes within the 
circular economy framework, as well as to contribute to 
improving their productivity and competitive conditions 
and to strengthen the link between companies. The 
strategy will include designing promotional instruments 
and economic-financial instruments; supporting policies 
through public purchases; creating innovation and 
research spaces, amongst others. By 2019, the strategy to 
boost the circular economy will have been developed. By 
2020, one of the promotional instruments included in the 
strategy will have been implemented.

of projects that go on to promote an effective transition to the circular economy. It links actors that are 
based on the principles of circular economy and encourages the implementation of circular business 
models, with particular emphasis on associative models that take advantage of synergies and 
complementarities. As a national program, it focuses on value chains that involve the use of resources 
and the use of waste from key sectors of the national economy. In Montevideo, this initiative model 
can be applied to assemble productive chains specifically associated with economic activities in which 
Montevideo shows greater strengths.

NEW INSTITUTIONALITY LINKED 
TO CREATIVE INDUSTRIES

Montevideo has a track record in promoting the audiovisual 
industry, through Locaciones Montevideanas, the Montevideo 
Socio Audiovisual programs and the Montevideo Filma 
Fund. However, the audiovisual industry ecosystem is being 
shifted towards an environment in which multiple disciplines 
linked to other creative industries come together, leaving 
this institutional framework obsolete in the face of new 
challenges.

This initiative involves modifying the current institutional 
structure and duties, to form a multidisciplinary support 
pole for creative industries in a broad sense; including the 
traditional audiovisual sector, the video game design sectors, 
content development and digital applications, advertising, 
artificial intelligence, amongst others. It also proposes the 
creation of an intersectoral plan to promote the creative 
sector in Montevideo. This includes guidelines, areas of 
development and specific actions that are to be taken in order 
to promote the sector in the short, medium and long term, 
appointing the people responsible and the specific goals for 
carrying out each action.

TRANSITORY USE OF SPACES AND 
INFRASTRUCTURES

With the purpose of targeting creativity and the benefits 
that arise from sharing knowledge, skills, time and available 
spaces in the city, the objective of this initiative is to promote 
the temporary use of vacant buildings and infrastructures. 
The transitory use enables more accessible opportunities 
to be offered to new entrepreneurs, as well as the impact 
of emerging projects to be measured and the development 
of cultural and social activities to be promoted. Similarly, it 
allows the evolution of installing permanent businesses to 
be evaluated, and at the same time makes a more efficient 
use of the installed capacity of the city whilst boosting certain 
sectors.

This initiative consists of promoting and supporting the 
creation of a digital platform through which potential users 
can access the available spaces and in the «meantime» they 
obtain said space, under certain conditions of exchange. In 
this way, vacant spaces or those with a higher potential of 
intensive use will be available to provide temporary individual 
and collective opportunities for economic, social and cultural 
development, including for example: emerging retail stores, 
joint work spaces, entertainment venues (bars, theaters, 
coffee shops), exhibition spaces, event venues, workshops 
and community projects.

Paris seeks to promote the use of 
temporary buildings and disused spaces 
and is in favor of taking advantage of the 
multiple benefits that can be generated 
for the city. Thus, by systematically putting 
the square meters available to use while 
waiting for real estate operations (that can 
take many years to develop), the urban 
environment conditions can be improved, 
the risks associated with disused and 
neglected conditions can be reduced and 
the specific needs of the community can be 
responded to. This initiative promoted by 
Paris seeks to promote the interconnection 
of owners and promoters with the leaders 
of emerging projects in the hope that all 
urban projects can integrate this principle 
based on developing a transitory or 
temporary occupation letter.

MONTEVIDEO’S CREATIVE MARKET 

Montevideo has been characterized by the quality and 
diversity of its cultural offerings. And in recent years, the 
creative economy has shown an important growth linked 
to new sectors, such as design, video games, comics, 
digital content applications, robotics, artificial intelligence, 
among others. However, these subsectors are not seen 
in an integrated manner, as a high-value sector of the 
economy or as a complement to other economic sectors 
relevant to the city, such as tourism.

Montevideo’s creative market stages a platform for the 
knowledge, diffusion, promotion and commercialization of 
the city’s creative industries’ goods and services in a bid to 
position them as agents of innovation and to increase their 
competitiveness, supported by associative and network 
work. The actions to be included as part of this initiative 
include:
 · Support for building a stakeholders’ network in the 

creative economy sector.

 · Creating spaces for advertising events and exchange 
activities between creative companies, and between 
them and other sectors of the economy to improve 
the understanding of the needs and capacities of each 
sector.

DEPARTMENTAL STRATEGY FOR 
TOURISM DEVELOPMENT

Montevideo is the main tourist destination in the country 
and annually receives a number of tourists that closely 
correlates to its population rate. However, there is a poor 
understanding of the importance of the tourism activity 
and its impact on the local economy. The interventions 
carried out by the departmental government are isolated, 
associated with low levels of investment and lack a frame 
of reference that provides coherence around defined 
objectives.

This initiative consists of the design and 
institutionalization of a strategic plan that identifies the 
potential market segments and the types of tourism 
products of greater relevance for positioning Montevideo, 
defining the guidelines for its development, establishing 
instruments for its implementation and forms of 
collaboration between public and private actors.

and private actors, with the aim of strengthening the 
department’s tourism competitiveness. However, there are 
currently several obstacles that, according to its objectives, 
have weakened their actions and put limitations on the 
expected results. 

This initiative will promote the reviewing of the 
organizational structure of the Bureau, its objectives, the 
resources needed to comply with them and the economic-
financial instruments that guarantee its sustainability 
over time. The Cultural Offer and Entertainment Table 
(MOCE), one of the most successful coordination spaces, 
will be a specific subject of study with the objective of 
recognizing its positive elements and strengthening them 
through the diversification of the portfolio programs (such 
as Montevideo + Paseos and Montevideo + Museos), the 
establishment of new alliances between entrepreneurs 
and the improvement of links with the creative industries 
sector.

INSPIRATION FROM THE 100RC NETWORK: 
Glasgow, an attractive city based on tourism

Glasgow is portrayed as a vibrant and diverse city. A part of 
this positive status derives from the creation of a Leading 
Group made up of actors from the private sector, academia 
and the public sector, which focused on strengthening this 
image and positioning it as an attractive city on a global 
level. Glasgow formed an organization whose mission it 
was to inspire citizens and visitors to have more enriching 
experiences of the city. This particular organization 
is in charge of managing the successful city-brand: 
People Make Glasgow and also established the Glasgow 
Convention Bureau. These and other actors proposed 
creating a 2023 Tourism Plan, as a framework for the 
constant tourism-based growth of the economy. This plan 
is to be collectively implemented by private actors from 
the industry, academia and the public sector.

NATIONAL PLAN FOR ADAPTING TO 
CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE COASTAL 
ZONE - MONTEVIDEO PILOT 
TERRITORY

This plan is the national government’s initiative to build 
a national policy for adapting the coastal areas of the 
country to climate change, in a process designed to 
generate strategies for the entire national coastal territory, 
with an integral basin management focus. Montevideo 
agreed early on to articulate and participate in the plan, 
as a pilot territory, with the purpose of achieving a higher 
degree of specificity in the strategies that are to be 
adopted for Montevideo’s territory.

This agreement implies the following: participating in 
training workshops that are dedicated to developing 
technological tools for the evaluation of the impacts 
and vulnerability, the creation of joint technical teams to 
generate new information about the risk level of the entire 
coastal territory and specific diagnosis and prospective 
data for coastal sectors that are considered by Montevideo 
to be critical. Likewise, Montevideo directly participates 
in defining strategies to help adapt, including for its own 
territory, in the national policy.

Articulation with national policies. 

Montevideo participates in this national 

initiative, as a means of generating 
synergies, ensuring coherent policies 
at different levels of government and 

improving the efficiency of the resilience 
building processes at departmental and 

national levels. It aims to guide, at a 
national level, the available resources 
(which are destined to adapt to climate 

change) towards actions based on 
priority in favor of the departmental 

government, according to the preliminary 
resilience assessment results. In this way, 
Montevideo puts the knowledge acquired 
at the national plan elaboration process’ 
disposal, whilst elaborating its resilience 

strategy.

SUSTAINABLE DRAINAGE PROJECT 

Having a sustainable drainage network contributes 
to successfully managing urban waters with a basin 
approach, conserving the urban hydrological cycle and 
building communities that are more sensitive to water risk. 
It increases the permeability of surfaces close to basins, 
allows more rainwater to infiltrate the soil and avoids 
occasional and large discharges into the Montevideo 
bay. Similarly, diffused pollution of water resources is 
also reduced, and the ecosystem’s service sources are 
increased.

Montevideo has made some specific interventions of 
this type as pilot experiences. The initiative consists 
of planning and implementing a sustainable drainage 
system, expanding the infrastructure spectrum that is to 
be incorporated so that they can work in an interconnected 
manner, including: rain gardens, rehabilitation of water 
courses, greenways, permeable pavements and green 
stripes in sidewalks, green roofs, pocket squares and 
floodplain and retention spaces. Firstly, a reduced set of 
options will be selected to be implemented in the basins of 
urban courses where the greatest risks and incidents (due 
to heavy rain flooding) have been identified.

INSPIRATION OF THE 100RC NETWORK: 
New Orleans: Investing in integral and 
innovative urban water management 
The city of New Orleans will implement an 
integral storm water management model 
to complement the traditional drainage 
system, with an ecological infrastructure 
that delays and stops rainwater from 
building in landscaped spaces. The city 
partners with national and international 
experts to prioritize projects through 
a detailed analysis that focuses on 
hydrology, economics and social equity. 
New Orleans aims to reduce infrastructure 
costs, reduce the risks of flooding, 
minimise land subsidence and transform 
infrastructure into attractive services that 
may improve neighbourhoods and their 
quality of life.

to address this situation immediately and as a priority, 
in parallel with the studies and evaluations planned to 
select the management model and the most appropriate 
technologies for Montevideo’s situation.

The objective is to improve the existing infrastructures 
in order to establish a more efficient and redundant 
management of solid waste. The main action and priority 
are extending the service life of the sanitary landfill, which 
will be complemented with:
 · Creation of a new logistics center as an operational base
 ·
 · Optimizing the infrastructure for the landfill’s leachate 

for waste management.

 · Eradicating informal activities within the landfill.
 · Optimizing the biogas plant management, which is 

currently installed in the sanitary landfill and that it is 
used for generating energy for the landfill’s facilities 
consumption.

FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR A WASTE TO ENERGY PLANT 

Montevideo studies a variety of management models and available 
technologies to improve its efficiency in solid waste management, taking 
into account its role as a capital city and the principal center of the 
metropolitan area. The initiative consists of carrying out a technical and 
economic feasibility study for the construction and operation of a power 
generation plant from wastes, which is aimed at complementing the 
recycling solutions, and as an alternative to the final disposal in a sanitary 
landfill.

EXPANSION OF THE RECYCLING 
PROGRAM

The program seeks to promote the separation of wastes 
at the place of origin, reducing the volume of solid wastes 
entering the Montevideo landfill and valuing dry fractions 
that cannot be received in the current four plants of the 
Container Management Plan.

What is being proposed is the incorporation of a new 
waste sorting plant and eight collection centers for 
recyclable dry fractions, debris, bulky waste and pruning 
(one in each municipality). In each of these centers, rooms 
for environmental education for children and the youth 
will be built, as well as having training activities and 
encouraging community participation.

The Protected Area with Santa Lucía’s Managed Resources 
Wetlands, shared by the departments of Montevideo, 
Canelones and San José became part of the National 
System of Protected Areas (SNAP) in February 2015. It is 
an area of high conservation value, not only because of the 
coastal saline wetland system at the mouth of the Santa 
Lucía river, but also because of the presence of native 
vegetation, sandy beaches, rocky points and fluvial islands. 
In particular, the wetland area supports agricultural 
activity and maintains traditional trades, such as carreros, 
areneros, junqueros and artisanal fishing.

The initiative consists of elaborating a management 
plan for the protected area and establishing use and 
exploitation conditions for the natural resources of the 
area, with the purpose of conserving their prioritized 
ecosystems, as well as their ecosystem services, which 
provide the economic activity that sustains many of the 
surrounding families.

FAMILY FARMING PROGRAM ON 
AGROECOLOGICAL BASES

The rural area of Montevideo plays a fundamental role 
for sustainability not only for its urban area, but for the 
entire metropolitan area. It plays an important role in 
intensive agricultural production, which contributes, to a 
large extent, to the food sustainability of its population. In 
addition, it provides employment for thousands of rural 
family farmers who work on small-scale farms.

This initiative aims to promote the formation of groups 
of family farmers around two production systems: family 
poultry and organic farming. It is based on a participatory 
research methodology integrated by producers and 
technicians from Uruguay’s Agroecology Network, as 
well as other public institutions, with the objective of 
solving the main limitations of these production systems, 
improving production techniques at the farming level and 
identifying market opportunities which can support its 
sustainability.

Montevideo agreed early on, by articulating and participating 
in the plan, through different activity areas directly linked to 
building resilience. The initiative includes:

 · Activities to raise awareness, consultations and risk 

management training among stakeholders, including: 
local government officials, civil society organizations 
(trade unions, research institutions, non-governmental 
organizations), financial partners and the private sector.
 · Developing a strategy to intervene at a standard scale 
with the adaptation of medium risk homes located in 
consolidated flooded urban land areas, in order to prevent 
and minimize the impact of flooding. There will be a set 
of measures specifically designed for the cases identified 
in Montevideo, which will be applied in the private 
sphere with the property owners’ direct participation. 
These measures will be accompanied by communication 
actions to show their relevance in reducing risks, through 
explanations, technical training and financing forms for 
carrying out its execution.

The initiative refers to Edible Cities Solutions, an international 
cooperation project that aims to build a productive, 
sustainable and socially resilient network of cities, based 
on the systematic use of the urban landscape for food 
production. The methodology that is to be applied focuses 
on empowering communities through dynamic and inclusive 
participation in new business models for food production, 
linked to the green economy.

Montevideo will participate in the network as a «follower 
city», a recipient of the experience and good practices applied 
by the «leading» cities of the network. The proposed initiative 
consists of preparing a master plan for integrating actions for 
urban regeneration, based on nature, focused on training and 
the transfer of technologies to local communities.

Montevideo has extensive experience in environmental 
education activities, whose forms and contents have been 
updated on an ongoing basis to meet the communication 
needs of the institution and the preferences of the population.

This initiative capitalizes on existing activities that are 
aimed at promoting participation, awareness and training in 
environmental issues, carrying out specific actions that are 
linked to the resilience theme and to comprehensive risk 
management. Special editions of the following activities will 
be carried out in this vein:

 · A photography and short films contest for young people. 

Montevideo Resilient Edition.  
The contest’s objective is to spread the concept of urban 
resilience among secondary school students through 
the creation of short films and photographs related to 
this topic. The proposal is built on the calls for programs 
annually set up by the environmental technical education 
team, in coordination with the National Public Education 
Administration (ANEP). As part of the initiative, the content 
elaboration for designing the Ceibal Plan is focused on 
the urban concept of resilience and comprehensive risk 
management, its relevance to the city of Montevideo and 
the community’s possibilities of action. 

 · Robotica project at the environment’s service. 

Montevideo Resilient Edition.  
This is part of the “Local Governments: Sustainable 
development and equity” initiative, an activity which 
promotes the use of technology for environmental 
purposes through education and the complementarity 
between municipalities and territories, placing priority on 
the participation of educational centers. In the Montevideo 
Resilient edition, a robotic application project linked to risk 
management will be proposed.

RESILIENCE STRATEGYMontevideo Resilience StrategyDuring the process of elaborating this 
strategy, it was deemed important to 
have, at an early stage, spaces for integral 
experimentation that would allow for the 
building of trust among actors linked to 
the implementation of their proposals and 
demonstrated the added value of including 
the resilience approach in management.

These experimental spaces are shaped as 
resilience laboratories.

Beyond the outcomes and impacts 
derived from the plans and projects that 
are implemented, the laboratories have, 
as mere processes, a resilience value 
in themselves: through the integral and 
transversal approach to the problem 
that is to be solved, a critical mass and 
social capital around the concept of 
resilience is generated in advance; intra 
and interinstitutional agreements are 
established to implement them and new 
governance models are experimented with 
to address the permanent change that 
Montevideo faces in the 21st century.

     93

TOWARDS A NEW 
MANAGEMENT MODEL

All of the laboratories are developed 
around a main initiative: a plan that 
incorporates a new management 
model for a territory or for a specific 
theme. This plan is the laboratory’s 
key strategic tool, from which all of 
the actions that will be implemented 
(to meet the laboratory’s objective) in 
the medium term will derive.

At the same time, laboratories 
incorporate tactical tools; a set 
of early actions, derived from the 
initiatives foreseen in the 4 pillars, 
that allow them to experiment through 
action and demonstrate results in 
the short term, whilst still advancing 
in building the laboratory’s main 
strategic tool.

The building process for each of 
these strategic plans, with a one-
year duration kept in mind, contain 
a set of initiatives centered on 
communication, education and 
building of skills and a formulation 
of agreements between institutions, 
which create the conditions that are 
deemed necessary to facilitate their 
subsequent implementation under the 
resilience framework.

LAB 1: 
TRANSFORMATION OF THE PANTANOSO STREAM BASIN

The Pantanoso stream basin is one of the territories considered 
strategic by the Land-Use Planning Department Guidelines. It was 
defined as a laboratory because it presents a multidimensional 
problem that articulates all of the strategy’s pillars in a territory 
considered strategic for developing a resilient Montevideo.

LAB 2: 
INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE COASTAL TERRITORY

The coastal area by the Río de la Plata is a territory which forms part 
of the people of Montevideo’s identity and is exposed to numerous 
anthropogenic and natural pressures. It was selected as a laboratory 
due to the need to generate a global development project linked to the 
rest of the department, without neglecting its sectoral and territorial 
specificities.

LAB 3: 
INTEGRAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management in Montevideo has traditionally been considered 
under a sectoral approach focused on emergency care. Due to its 
relevance in building resilience, it requires the incorporation of a 
contemporary and multidimensional approach. It was defined as a 
laboratory so as to ensure that the new risk management policy meets 
the objectives of the 4 pillars of the strategy.

The purpose of this laboratory is to articulate in due time and form the different public and private actions that 
take place in the basin area as by doing so, the territorial plan’s value can be used as a guide for intervening with 
the territory. It is then to be complemented with a management and implementation program that guarantees a 
deep socio-territorial transformation, and a substantial change in the collective imagination regarding the stream 
and its values. 

Located in the center-west of Montevideo, the Pantanoso 
stream basin is an area of high social vulnerability, 
housing precariousness and environmental degradation, 
and approximately 190,000 people live there. Within this 
area, rural production, logistic and industrial uses and 
consolidated urban sectors all coexist with precarious 
settlements in low and flood-prone areas, and consequent 
conflicts arise from the contact of all of the diverse 
modalities in which the territory is occupied. This situation 
of social and environmental risk is deepened by the 
presence of informal economic activities linked to the 
inadequate management of solid wastes that negatively 
impact the environmental quality of land and water 
courses.

This area is subject to numerous sectoral interventions 
implemented by the three levels of government, without 
an inter-institutional coordination that takes advantage of 
the generated synergies and which can optimize the use 
of the invested resources. However, it does have a special 
opportunity to promote a change in the management 
model: the Partial Plan of the Pantanoso Stream Basin, 
whose territorial planning objective is to promote socio-
territorial integration and contribute to the improvement 
of its environmental qualities, through integral planning 
of the territory that includes all of its different dimensions 
and components.

INSPIRATION FROM 100RC:  
Medellín: Integral Urban Projects 
Medellín has successfully developed the Social Urbanism 
model to promote the integral human development of 
its inhabitants, understanding this as a development 
for the people through participation of the people. This 
model aims to target problems such as poverty, exclusion, 
inequality, violence, lack of economic growth and low 
governance, through projects and inter-institutional 
programs located in the most marginal areas of the city.

One of the most noteworthy intervention instruments, 
developed within the Social Urbanism model, is the so-
called Integrated Urban Projects (PUI), which covers all of 
the urban dimensions, including mobility, public space, 
housing, equipment, environmental improvement and the 
relocation of communities in high-risk areas, with the aim 
of solving specific problems of a defined territory.

COLLECTIVE DEBATE WITH THE 
COLLABORATING PARTNERS’ SUPPORT 

The RVR (Realization Value Resilience) approach, 
designed by the Rockefeller Foundation in collaboration 
with Value Lab, derives from a project management 
methodology that seeks to align stakeholders around key 
issues that can determine the success of the project.

This approach was applied to the Pantanoso stream 
basin resilience opportunity framing workshop, which 
was aimed at identifying the potential that can come 
from transforming the Pantanoso stream basin in such 
a way that creates social, environmental and economic 
value. The workshop helped to align key actors around 
the territorial planning opportunity offered by the scheme, 
analyzing the ways to capture that value for Montevideo, 

and to advance on defining a road map for a multisector 
transformation project for the basin with a mutual 
commitment from all levels of government.

Based on the results of the workshop, Arup, a strategic 
partner for Montevideo, developed the road map in detail, 
including references to similar urban interventions, action 
proposals that contribute to meeting the objectives set 
out in the workshop and possible arrangements for 
defining governance and financing issues. The final 
report is the guiding instrument for the development and 
implementation of this laboratory.

SUPPORTIVE TACTICAL ACTIONS
During the development of the main strategic initiative, the 
following early implementation actions will be carried out. 

L1.1.1 NACIENTES PRODUCTION PARK 
An intervention is proposed that is aimed at taking 
advantage of the current capacities of the Park of Agro 
industrial Activities (PAGRO) and integrates public access 
content into it, in the form of recreational programs, 
environmental restoration, environmental education, and 
agricultural production compatible with environmental 
conservation.  

L1.1.2 COLÓN-VILLA COLÓN SPACE
This is an intervention that aligns the Lineal Park of Lezica 
with the environment’s heritage values. The planned 
intervention in the Colón-Villa Space will be strengthened 
by connecting the stretch of the linear park (recently 
inaugurated) with the Idiarte Borda Castle, of architectural 
heritage value.

L1.1.3 PASO DE LA ARENA INTEGRATING SPACE
A physical intervention is proposed that would imply a 
substantial change in the conditioning and collective 
appropriation of the public spaces of Paso de la Arena by 
the stream. This intervention will be integrated towards 
developing structural solutions in the formal areas of the 
urban fabric that are recognized as flood areas.

L1.1.4 INTERPRETATION SPACE FOR WETLANDS
The construction of a public space in a sector threatened 
by the dumping of illegal waste is proposed to place 
value on the environmental and landscape qualities of the 
wetlands and its relationship with the environment’s new 
residential areas. It is complemented by a strategy which 
promotes environmental education

L1.1.5 PANTANOSO ENVIRONMENTAL 
COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION PROGRAM
The early interventions will be accompanied by a 
communication and environmental education program 
that further enhances them, incorporating programmatic 
content, promoting their collective appropriation and 
generating synergies among them.

LABORATORY 2

INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT OF 
THE COASTAL TERRITORY 

The objective of this laboratory is to implement a territorial management model that ensures that the necessary 
coordination and arrangements are made to achieve an integrated development of the entire coastal area, 
enhancing its links with the rest of the city whilst recognizing the local specificities, guaranteeing a collective and 
equitable use of the land and maximizing its potential as the main public space of the city.

The coast of Montevideo measures over 70 km by the 
Río de la Plata, along which three stretches with well-
differentiated characteristics can be identified: the west 
coast, of high naturalness, the bay of Montevideo and 
the east coast, densely populated and characterized by a 
succession of sandy beaches and rocky areas.

The coastal space is the city’s main public space, both 
democratic and accessible to everyone. It is home to the 
country’s main commercial port and several strategic 
value infrastructures (a thermoelectric power station, 
sanitation system plants, an oil refinery). It is the provider 
of valuable environmental services, it has a high landscape 
potential and is one of the main tourist attractions not only 
of the city, but of the country. 

It is, therefore, a territory of high economic, environmental, 
landscape and symbolic value, exposed to multiple 
tensions, both anthropic and natural. These tensions 
include the competition between activities to occupy 
strategic spaces, the environmental impacts derived from 
activities in the basins (by the other water resources from 
the Department), the coastal erosion and other damages 
to the ecosystem associated with the effects of climate 
change.

design will establish the intervention scales, the key issues 
that should be the subject of the agreements between 
interested parties and the governance spaces linked to 
them. It will be the strategic instrument that guides the 
development of the coastal territory and, therefore, it 
will contain the management guidelines and the actions 
necessary to comply with the objectives of this laboratory. 
In parallel to developing the plan, the laboratory’s 
implementation process communication strategy will be 
drawn out.

Adjustment of the total strategy, 

selection of new issues, early measures 

and prioritized priority local

DeCerca Entidad Consultora, a local company that 
accompanied Montevideo in the deepening of knowledge 
on various issues related to urban resilience, developed 
the study labelled as Ideas to structure a comprehensive 
plan for the development of the coastal territory of 
Montevideo. The objective of this study was to generate 
a road map for elaborating a development plan for the 
coastal territory of Montevideo based on MCI criteria 
and to design a set of initiatives aimed at promoting 
coordinated action in the territory. 

Based on the preliminary results of this study, and in 
collaboration with the strategic partner Arup, the Towards 
a more resilient coastal territory workshop was held, 
which was attended by an international expert consultant 
on the subject. For two days, the participants debated the 

following question «what do we need in order to achieve 
an integrated coastal management? ». International 
experiences were presented, advances were made to 
Montevideo’s coastal management, thematic visits to the 
coast were organised and the problems and opportunities 
of Montevideo’s coast were identified.

The workshop allowed for an agreed roadmap on 
developing the laboratory and helped in the creation of 
a common vision of the integrated coastal management 
concept among actors from different areas, which is key 
for carrying out its implementation. The final report is the 
guiding instrument for developing and implementing this 
laboratory.

SUPPORTIVE TACTICAL ACTIONS

During the development of the main strategic initiative, the 
following early implementation actions will be carried out. 

L2.1.1 CLEAN BAY PROJECT
This is an inter-institutional project aimed at outlining 
the actions needed to improve the environmental quality 
of the Montevideo Bay. The actions to be defined will 
address social, economic and environmental problems in 
Montevideo’s main stream basins.

L2.1.2 DIALOGUE FOR MANAGING THE TERRITORY 
LINKED TO THE PORT
The organization of activities and debate workshops will 
be implemented in order to deepen the mutual knowledge 
of the different actors that are linked to the port territory 
management and linking the territory interface with the 
urban environment, promoting the generation of inter-
institutional agreements to improve port-city interaction.

L2.1.3 COASTAL RISK MAP
As part of the National Coastal Adaptation Plan, 
Montevideo will participate as a pilot territory in building 
a risk map of the coast in the face of variability and 
climate change. This map will enable the identification 
of adaptation measures that are necessary to reduce the 
current risk level in the different stretches of the coastal 
front.

L2.1.4 WORKS FOR MITIGATING EROSION IN 
URBAN BEACHES
This initiative includes the development of sand filling 
options to achieve a 25 or 20-meter-long expansion on the 
Brava and Honda beach platforms, including a submerged 
retention structure composed of geotubes and a solution 
for retaining possible sand losses. In Brava beach’s case, 
a protection structure for the collector that crosses the 
beach is also included.

LABORATORY 3

INTEGRAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The objective of the laboratory is to implement a contemporary model for an integral risk management model in 
Montevideo, which considers prospective, corrective and compensatory management, and which highlights the 
intersections and synergies between disaster risk management and other development aspects, under a human 
rights approach. 

The contemporary conceptual framework for disaster 
risk management is built around the notion of social 
vulnerability and it is based on recognizing that risk is a 
process of social construction, where specific collective 
processes operate to create exposure conditions and 
vulnerability facing the environment’s different physical 
manifestations. It thus requires a management process 
that is closely linked to the sectoral and territorial 
development management10 processes. This framework 
implies a comprehensive approach to designing 
risk management policies to cover all development 
dimensions, as well as risk prevention, reduction and 
compensation. 

Montevideo, for cultural, institutional and 
communication reasons, is far from this modern risk 
management model. There is a very low perception of 
risk, both in institutions and in the public’s imagination. 
The Departmental Emergency Coordinating Center 
(CECOED) is the main departmental reference of the 
subject and it is recognized for its work in responding 
to emergencies. Other areas of the Intendancy also 
carry out activities related to risk management, such 
as the Territorial Planning Division or the Sanitation 
Division. However, these activities are not identified 
by the officials themselves, nor by the population, as 
activities related to risk management, as they do not 
fall under the concept of emergency response, the only 
institutional activity linked to disaster risk management 
(DRM).

MAIN STRATEGIC INITIATIVE: 

L3.1 DEPARTMENTAL 
PLAN FOR INTEGRAL RISK 
MANAGEMENT.

The plan will be designed based on an approach that 
considers reducing the existing risks and preventing 
future risks in all dimensions of development. It will be the 
fundamental strategic instrument for risk management at 
the departmental level and it will, therefore, mainstream 
necessary actions to fulfill the laboratory’s objective and 
the guidelines that will guide its implementation. The 
elaboration of the plan will be articulated with the National 
Policy for Integral Disaster Risk Management, developed 
by the National Emergency System (SINAE) and will 
encourage the active involvement of actors from different 
sectors of society, so that during the elaboration process, 
the whole of Montevideo becomes a scenario of learning 
and building resilience.

COLLECTIVE WORK WITH THE COLLABORATING 
PARTNERS’ SUPPORT

DeCerca Entidad Consultora was also the local 
partner that accompanied Montevideo in the early 
implementation of this laboratory by preparing the study, 
Bases for designing a comprehensive risk management 
plan for Montevideo.

This study allowed the available information on the 
current risk management situation of Montevideo to be 
systematized, offering a diagnosis of the department’s 
strengths and weaknesses on the subject, whilst 
generating a roadmap for preparing a comprehensive risk 

management plan. It also helped propose a set of actions 
to promote public and institutional awareness on the 
subject. 

The results were presented at the discussion table of 
the Intendancy of Montevideo Climate Change Risk 
Management Group’s Subgroup, for the collective debate 
of concepts and proposals developed. The final report 
acts as the guiding instrument for the development and 
implementation of this laboratory.

SUPPORTIVE TACTICAL ACTIONS
Durante el desarrollo de la iniciativa estratégica During the 
development of the main strategic initiative, the following 
early implementation actions will be carried out. 

L3.1.1 STRENGTHENING THE CECOED
Evaluating, analyzing and drawing up proposals on 
CECOED’s institutional role and its links with other 
planning and management areas of the Intendancy 
that develop key structural policies in the integral risk 
management processes. The process will culminate in a 
proposal of institutional redesign in accordance with the 
plan’s objectives.

L3.1.2 PARTICIPATIOINTEGRATEDN AND CITIZEN 
INNOVATION IN INTEGRAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Promoting different social participation strategies with 
a special emphasis on those that use TICs. They are 
small actions for strengthening citizen participation and 
knowledge of the city, based on existing spaces such 
as special editions of MVD Labs for risk management; 
environmental meetings in the Departmental Board; civil 
society initiatives that include risk management issues, 
amongst others.

L3.1.3 PILOT PROJECT FOR TRANSVERSAL WATER 
MANAGEMENT - POCITOS STREAM 
Rehabilitation of the Pocitos stream, through an integrated 
intervention that involves the recovery of the body of water 
(currently partially channelled), the building of rain gardens 
and the landscape arrangement of the environment. The 
project includes distributing informational posters about 
the basin, the watercourse and the benefits that the 
intervention will give rise to.

L3.1.4 TRANSITORY USE OF SPACES AND 
INFRASTRUCTURES
A legal (ownership situation) and economic feasibility 
study for utilizing productive infrastructures (to be 
identified), with the purpose of assigning them to 
transitory micro-enterprises, and a study analysis on the 
potential impacts on risk reduction derived from their 
current abandoned condition.

Next steps

The strategy’s building process offered a unique 
opportunity to recognize Montevideo’s progress in 
building resilience and to demonstrate the possibilities 
of enhancing its results through an articulated 
implementation under a holistic approach. It also 
facilitated the installation of new spaces for collective 
reflection, where existing paradigms were reviewed, and 
new ideas were generated to build management models 
that can help convert the challenges derived from global 
change into opportunities.

the processes is acknowledged as a form of learning and 
allows for continuous improvement in building resilience. 
Advancing on the design of specific resilience indicators 
that can be integrated with other development indicators 
of the institution, as well as deepening the analysis 
of links between resilience indicators and sustainable 
development objectives will be fundamental activities 
assumed by the UER, in close collaboration with the 
Resilience Council, in its advisory capacity and in its 
monitoring role during the implementation of the strategy. 

Internationally, Montevideo will capitalize on the value 
of belonging to the 100RC network, fostering the joint 
collaboration with different network members in 
addressing their main challenges. The participation of the 
platform’s partners by means of working collaboratively 
is anticipated to complement their knowledge. Similarly, 
it implores international academic experts to collaborate 
with local universities, and resilient city leaders to 
exchange learned lessons with their Montevideo peers, 
all focusing their efforts around key initiatives for building 
resilience in Montevideo.
 
This collaborative network experience will be projected into 
other cities’ networks in which Montevideo participates 
on a global scale. Transferring our experience at 100RC to 
other cities around the world will help Montevideo continue 
its path as a resilient city that is open to the world.

We can all contribute to building a more dynamic, 

connected, inclusive, solidary, innovative, co-

creative, committed and prepared Montevideo, or 
in other words, a more resilient Montevideo. So, we 
invite you to get involved in this process and to give 
rise to greater opportunities, to improve our quality 

of life and, in short, to make us all happier.  

The publication of this document indicates the closing of 
a cycle in the resilience building process and at the same 
time the beginning of a period of realizing ideas, obtaining 
results and deepening the quest for answers to challenges 
that have not yet been solved. Montevideo will advance 
in this way, deepening and consolidating the changes 
introduced in different areas:

Institutionally, progress will be made consolidating and 
strengthening the UER and the CRO figure by formalizing a 
team that is dedicated to the implementation, review and 
evaluation of the strategy. Likewise, the resilience office 
will assume a leadership role in incorporating the concept 
of resilience into the strategic and sectoral planning of 
the institution, and particularly, in the collective process of 
building Montevideo del mañana.

Operationally, the cycle will continue to elaborate 
annual operational plans that will guide the strategy’s 
implementation initiatives based on a collaborative work 
model. The multisectoral and multi-institutional working 
groups that were formed while elaborating the strategy 
will continue to be the driving force in the implementation 
phase. Maintaining the momentum of these work areas 
and the commitment of all the parties involved is indeed 
a great challenge: it will require the operational plans 
to consider the needs of each of those involved and 
encourage the achievement of concrete results in the short 
term, while advancing in longer-term processes. This is 
where the strategic and focused resilience laboratories 
will play a fundamental role in implementing the strategy, 
allowing to concentrate resources and willpower on 
integral interventions that generate high impact results.

Showing results and learning from them will be a 
fundamental part of the strategy’s implementation 
process. The importance of monitoring and evaluating

Montevideo Resilience StrategyAPPENDICES116   

     117

MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
INDICATORS

Montevideo assigns high relevance to the strategy’s 
monitoring and evaluation processes, not only for the 
accountability of the work done, but as a form of learning 
and thus continuously improving in building resilience. 

As part of this strategy’s management, a key activity will 
be building a system of indicators aimed at measuring 
the resilience value of each initiative and the strategy 
in an integral manner. This is a large-scale activity and 
requires a level of planning and conceptual development 
according to its relevance in continuing to build 
knowledge around the concept of resilience. 

The system of indicators should be articulated with 
other related indicators carried out by the Intendancy 
of Montevideo or other public and private institutions to 

optimize resources and take advantage of the synergies. 
But it also must be in accordance with the conceptual 
developments promoted by the 100RC and the other 
monitoring and evaluation processes carried out by the 
network’s cities. Many of these indicators will be new 
additions and therefore it will be necessary to evaluate 
their actual measurement feasibility and the possibility of 
building an adequate baseline. 

Based on the above, it was decided that the outcome 
and impact indicators should be subject to careful 
development during the strategy’s implementation phase. 
However, some measurement metrics are included for 
each of the objectives, which enable early tracking of the 
progress’ results.

The Strategy is the result of collective work carried 
out through various instances in which numerous 
participants from national government institutions, 
different government departments, municipalities, the 
academic sector, the private sector and civil society took 
part. We greatly appreciate each and every contribution, 
as well as the constant support received from the 100 
Resilient Cities team, the strategic partner Arup, some 

100RC platform partners, the exchange with the network’s 
cities, as well as from the consultancies carried out in 
developing this process. 

To all, we say a huge thank you and we invite you to 
continue to participate in building a more resilient 
Montevideo.
