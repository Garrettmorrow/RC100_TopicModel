Letter from 
the Mayor  
of Juarez

Juarez is a city that learns from its past and builds on 
its strengths. Its people are the backbone of the city 
and have always shown the will to adapt, survive and 
prosper during its long, rich history, no matter what 
challenges they face.
The people of Juarez, which is strategically located on 
the northern border of Mexico, have a proven flexibility 
and determination, perhaps due to our desert environ-
ment. These qualities have enabled us to capitalize on 
new opportunities for growth. 
As Mayor, I am very proud to introduce the first Juarez 
Resilience Strategy. This document outlines our path 
to a balanced, more resilient future. It provides a view 
of Juarez as a city prepared for what lies ahead, a city 
that lays a foundation for inclusive prosperity; a city 
that addresses environmental, social and economic 
challenges through a strategic vision that includes all 
the inhabitants of this region.
This Resilience Strategy was designed in collaboration 
with a wide range of stakeholders from various local 
institutions, the public and private sectors, and civil 
society. It provides a dynamic roadmap that is com-
plementary to existing strategies and action plans. It 
includes our efforts today, but it also articulates our 
city’s future challenges and offers solutions for both 
future city leaders and citizens. Juarez is already a re-

silient city, but we want to do more. And that is what 
this strategy is all about —  always looking to the future 
and finding opportunities to improve our city. I want to 
thank everyone for your contributions to our city, the 
100RC Network for all the support provided during this 
project, and the Resilient Juarez Team who partnered 
with us on the various projects. But above all, I thank 
each and every citizen of Juarez who has committed 
to making Juarez a more resilient city.
Now is the time to maximize our efforts to secure a le-
gacy for future generations. Together, we must set the 
pace for continued progress in our city.

IntroductionResilient JuarezlettersLetter from  
Michael Berkowitz

On behalf of 100 Resilient Cities staff I want to congratula-
te Mayor Armando Cabada Alvidrez, the Chief Resilience 
Officer Veronica Gonzalez and Juarez for the launching of 
Resilient Juarez. This is an important milestone for the city 
and our collaboration with it.
As the largest city on the border with the United States, 
Juarez has played a fundamental role in Mexico’s growth 
and development. The county’s first customs office was 
established in Juarez, and it is now home to the Museum 
of the Revolution. The city is also known for its diversity, 
its large population of young people, and a growing entre-
preneurial spirit. For all these reasons, the city is positioned 
to set the direction of Mexico’s future. Despite its reputa-
tion for drug-related violence and tragic femicides, Juarez 
is today a safer, more vibrant city that is full of civic pride. 
City leaders have made great strides in bringing abando-
ned public places, including the city’s Historic District, back 
to life and creating safe spaces for women. 
Although the city has moved forward, it still faces challen-
ges that could impact and inhibit its resilience. The desert 
impacts, the extreme weather variations as well as floods, 
droughts and heat waves are frequent and destructive 
shocks. At the same time, chronic stresses such as unem-
ployment, crime, and poverty continue to erode the urban 
fabric and makes Juarez even more vulnerable when shoc-
ks occur. Other conditions that pose a threat to the city’s 
resilience if left unaddressed include the city’s rapid growth 
and the resulting urban sprawl, and its excessive depen-
dency on the export industry (maquiladoras).
This Resilience Strategy provides not just a perspective 
on these shocks and stresses, but concrete actions to ad-
dress them, including some initiatives specifically devoted 
to the safety of  
One of these initiatives will reuse 20% of the land in the city 
that is regarded as unsafe and violence-prone wasteland. 
Owners of these plots of land would receive incentives to 
turn them into temporary public spaces. If the land is in an 
area without green spaces, the owner would be offered a

Veronica Gonzalez

special incentive to turn the land into a green space. 
This type of initiative addresses environmental concerns 
as well safety and social cohesion goals. Other initiatives 
would bring community leaders into the planning process, 
thus guaranteeing that their needs and voices are reflec-
ted in any actions that might affect them. And important-
ly, this strategy includes actions that will empower citizens 
and transform the city’s image in order to attract tourism 
and investment.
Through the commitment and hard work of Chief Resilien-
ce Officer Gonzalez and her team, as well as the support of 
Mayor Alvidrez, this Resilience Strategy reflects the city’s 
diverse voices and all the communities that were involved 
in its development. While the launching of this Strategy is 
a very important achievement, the work of resilience-buil-
ding is far from completed. It will no doubt require per-
sistence and unwavering commitment to make the vision 
described in these pages a reality. We look forward to con-
tinued collaboration with the city.

Michael berkowitz
Chair, 100 Resilient Cities

When we discuss resilience in Juarez, we recall the 
catastrophic events that have marked the city, its 
inhabitants, and the deep wounds that have not yet 
healed. While these wounds are still open, we can 
become a unified society and creating the condi-
tions in which we can coexist and live in harmony.
Juarez, one of the most extensive semi-desert zones 
in Mexico (with an extreme climate), and positioned 
geographically on the border, has faced many cha-
llenges over the years, reinventing itself on a daily ba-
sis. Urban resilience, as a concept, has been and will 
continue to be an overarching, inclusive and resour-
ceful approach to addressing our challenges.
This document, Juarez Resilience Strategy, is the 
result of the combined efforts of stakeholders from 
various sectors of society, both from Juarez and El 
Paso, our sister city on the US side of the border. The 
strategy includes a series of actions, collaboratively 
developed, to strengthen the city and foster its lon-
gevity. These actions demonstrate the aspirations 
of the citizens of Juarez. The four pillars of the Resi-
lience Strategy – Inclusivity, Integration, Adaptability 
and Prosperity – will serve as a model for other cities 
in the region, securing Juarez’s place as a pioneer of 
the resilience movement.
Every word, every line, every action is devoted to 
improving the lives and the well-being of Juarez ci-
tizens. It has been written for every girl, boy, young 
person, woman, man, senior citizen – every human 
being living in this beloved place that is Juarez .

“We have to 
assimilate the 
enormous weight of 
our past, so we will 
not forget what gives 
us life. If you forget 
your past, you die1 .”

IntroductionLettersResilient Juarez8Resilient JuarezExecutive Summary

Throughout its history, Juarez has evolved its ca-
pacity through economic and social strategies. 
Yet, urban planning critical to the future develo-
pment of the city has been relegated. Today, the 
maquiladora industry, while being one of the ci-
ty’s strengths and major assets, causes excessi-
ve dependency on global markets. Juarez must 
transition to another economic model in the near 
future and, at the same time, address the critical 
issues of urban development.  
The city limits of Juarez have expanded over the 
years due to unplanned urban sprawl. Thus, The 
city must improve its approach to planning, take 
into account the needs of its citizens, and ena-
ble their involvement at the municipal and state 
levels. Juarez is a city that has been shaped by 
people from many different places and in times 
of crisis, that diversity creates  conflict. 
The population includes a significant number 
of young people. If the energy and talents of 
these young people were to be appropriately 
harnessed, the city can become a thriving me-
tropolis by 2030. 
The geographic location and climate of Juarez is 
both a weakness and an opportunity. The city’s 
desert surroundings and extreme temperatures 
create health issues among both permanent and 

temporary citizens, affecting the quality of its ser-
vices, and their safety. Given these factors, envi-
ronmental resilience is critical.
In December 2014, Juarez was selected to be 
part of 100 Resilient Cities, an initiative pionee-
red and funded by The Rockefeller Foundation. 
In 2015 the process of diagnosing the city´s re-
silience began. About 600 people participated 
in identifying the city’s key challenges and po-
tential ways in which they could be addressed. 
A wide range of strategic actors collaborated on 
the development of the Juarez Resilience Stra-
tegy, offering their ideas and experience in mee-
tings and workshops.
The Resilience Strategy consists of 4 pillars, 11 
goals, and 33 actions. The pillars (Inclusive Jua-
rez, Prosperous Juarez, Integrated Juarez, and 
Adapted Juarez) are the backbone of the stra-
tegy and serve as a guide to achieving a resilient 
city. The 11 long-term goals will be accomplished 
through 33 concrete actions—specific projects 
and  tactical  activities  implemented  to  meet 
the  Strategy’s  objectives.  To  strengthen  the 
collaboration among the various actors, three 
cross-cutting axes (best practices in community 
development) are included: human rights, citizen 
involvement, and good governance.

10

Safe and Empowered Community

This pillar is about improving urban life and the urban environment in 
a way that aligns with what people want and need. Under this pillar, 
the city encourages substantial citizen involvement, as it is through 
this type of engagement that positive change will occur. Actions re-
lated to the use of public space are a good starting point for citizen 
involvement because the city and its citizens have a clear stake in 
city spaces that are more inclusive, green and safe. 

Strong, Diverse and Competitive Economy

This pillar is designed to respond to the need to diversify the current 
economic model through innovation, competitiveness and a focus on 
sustainability. This requires the growth of high-quality, well-paid green 
jobs; the creation of programs that foster scientific development; and the 
forging of new relationships among the academic and industrial sectors 
and the community. Prosperous Juarez seeks to lead these efforts and 
increase investments that will ensure the economic growth and well-be-
ing of Juarez families.

A City that is a Model of Resilient Planning

This pillar focuses on creating a resilient, innovative, long-term urban 
planning approach that guarantees full access to the city to all its in-
habitants. It seeks to implement strategies that bring together the pre-
viously segregated sections of the city. Most of the jobs in Juarez are 
clustered in its existing industrial parks and along the city’s northern 
border, while workers’ homes are on the periphery of the city. Therefore, 
this pillar focuses on transportation-oriented development and priori-
tizes alternative and sustainable mobility as well as the creation of safe 
corridors for pedestrians and cyclists.

A Society that Protects the Environment and Is Prepared to 
Face Disasters
This pillar aims to make the most of the advantages and opportunities 
presented by the city’s desert environment and ensure the sustainable 
use of its resources by creating management models for non-renewable 
resources. This pillar focuses on the need to create awareness about the 
risks posed by climate change, such as water supply shortages, heat wa-
ves and floods, and uses the concept of resilience as a lens for adaptation 
and transformation.

RESILIENT JUAREZ

   Urban resilience is the capacity of individuals, 

communities, institutions, businesses and systems 

within a city to survive, adapt and grow, no matter 

what kind of acute shocks and chronic stresses 

they experience.

     1In December 2014, 
Juarez was chosen to be 
part of the 100 Resilient 
Cities Initiative. 

Pioneered and funded by Rockefeller Foundation. 
The 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative is a pro-
gram that supports the adoption and incorpora-
tion of a resilience vision which includes assessing 
the shocks (i.e., earthquakes, fires, floods) and the 
stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day-
to-day or cyclical basis, so that the participant ci-
ties become more resilient and better prepared to 
face the physical, social and economic challenges 
of the 21st century.
The project promotes the hiring of a Chief Resi-
lience Officer (CRO) charged with fostering and 
coordinating the resilience initiatives of the city, 
offers a network of experts who can help deve-
lop a city’s resilience strategy, and provides ac-
cess to services offered by strategic partners at 
a global level. As a member of the 100RC Ne-
twork, the city gains access to other 100RC cities 
in order to exchange experiences and share best 
practices. 100RC aims to help individual cities 
become more resilient and build collaboration 
among governments, civil society, the private 
sector, and individual citizens. The program con-
sists of three phases.

Deeper 
Knowledge of 
City´s Priorities 

During  this  phase,  new  analysis  is 
conducted  and  the  city’s  primary 
challenges  are  explored  in  more 
depth. Gaps and interdependencies 
are also identified. This phase ends 
with the launching of the Resilience 
Strategy for the city.

Identification of 
the Top Challenges 
Faced by the City 

In this phase, a resilience baseline is 
established with the participation and 
involvement of various key stakehol-
ders. This phase concludes with the 
preparation of the Preliminary Resi-
lience Assessment (PRA)

Strategy 
Implementation

This phase focuses on development 
and implementation of the initiatives 
identified in the Resilience Strategy.

01  100RC initiative at Juarez19Resilient Juarez18Resilient JuarezIn 1970 ecologists coined the term resilience to 
describe the capacity of a system to maintain 
or recover its functionality in the event of an in-
terruption or disruption. Resilience is applicable 
to cities, as they are complex systems that are 

constantly adapting to changing circumstances. 
To build this recovery capacity, cities must be 
designed and function in such a way that they 
can resist, respond and adapt quickly to shocks 
and stresses.

The CRF is the result of extensive research on resilient systems. It 
identifies seven resilience qualities all resilient cities have:

1.2 
Understanding 
UrbanResilience

The concept of a 
resilient city becomes 
relevant when acute 
shocks and chronic 
stresses threaten the 
city’s systems.  

These are well-conceived, 
well-constructed and well-
managed systems.

Bring together systems and 
institutions that work together 
to achieve greater ends.

Create spare capacity to 
accommodate disruptions due 
to extreme stresses, surges in 
demand or an external event.

RESILIENT JUAREZ

Juarez is located in the northern part of Mexico, 

in Chihuahua State, by the shore of the Rio 

Grande along the border of the United States. It 

is Chihuahua’s largest city and Mexico’s eighth 

largest metropolitan area (INEGI, 2015).

          The economy of  Juarez is based on  manufactu-
ring. The city is strategically located near the bor-
der bridges and has quick access to many areas. 

Most of the raw materials come from U.S. compa-
nies that use their Mexican subsidiaries for manu-
facturing because of Mexico’s lower labor costs.

2.1 Juarez   
through 
History

The City’s
Origins

Bridge across the Rio Grande by Fred 
Murer, from the special collections of Juarez 
Autonomous University.

The city of Juarez dates back to the 17th cen-
tury, with the establishment of the Mission of 
Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1659, the bringing 
of peace, and conversion of the Jumano, Suma 
and Manso Indians who had lived there since 
ancient times. During the Spanish conquest of 

the northern territories of Mexico, the city be-
came a strategic  stopping place for travelers  
in the inhospitable country. At the beginning 
of the 18th century, a “presidio” (military town) 
was established to protect the interests of the 
Spanish crown.

The city’s early irrigation system consisted of two 
main canals (Acequia Madre and Acequia del Pue-
blo) and their numerous secondary canals. Despi-
te the area’s desert surroundings, an abundance of 
water and fertile soil enabled intensive farming. To 

the eyes of a traveler at the end of the 18th century, 
Paso del Norte was like the “Murcia Orchard itself” 
and from that time forward was famous for its vines, 
fruits and, above all, the cotton, which is so charac-
teristic of northern Mexico.

Modern City

In the first decades of the 20th century, many bor-
der cities got their supplies from their sister cities 
in the U.S., as they were able to find a diversity of 
products at good prices. In Juarez a nascent in-
dustrial zone, which was linked to cotton and other 
agricultural products for the local market, exten-
ded southwest along the railroad tracks. By 1950, 
there were 6,765 jobs in the commercial area  

 along the tracks, on the street leading to the interna-
tional bridge, around the old mission, and in the main 
streets of the city. Another thriving industry at the 
time was the entertainment industry, specifically can-
tinas (bars). The idea of driving the city’s economic 
development by strengthening industry, commerce 
and agriculture was beginning to take hold by 1960 
among those with economic and political influence.

Industrial 
City

 
Starting in 1960, programs to foster 
the city’s development were begun: 

1

National Border Program (1961): Its 
goal was to foster economic and so-
cial development along the bor-
der, making it appealing to tourists. 
To this end, the Federal Govern-
ment invested in the construction of 
cultural centers, museums, and spa-
ces for the sale of Mexican crafts.

2

Border Industrialization Program: This 
was created when the Bracero (migrant

end of that program left 200,000 Mexi-
cans who had worked in U.S. fields wi-
thout jobs. Many decided to stay in 
northern Mexico rather than go back 
where they came from without a job.

Maquiladoras Regime (1972): Its 
goal was to develop the bor-
der zone and contribute to re-
ducing regional inequalities. 
Since then, the growth of ma-
quilas has accelerated, and they 
have dominated border life.

02 An Overview of the City28Resilient JuarezFrom 1983 to 1990, the growth in the labor 
force was so strong that it consolidated the 
position of the maquiladora industry, which 
has shaped the city. Migrants to the city have 
usually settled in the west and southwest 
areas of the city, which are the most vulne-
rable sections of the city. The entry of massi-
ve numbers of women into the labor market 
was another effect of the growth of the ma-
quiladora industry. This has disrupted tradi-
tional family roles and resulted in a high rate 
of domestic and sexual violence against wo-
men as well as a high rate of femicides. (Pa-
dilla, 2012: 699).

Challenges in  
Ciudad Juarez4

Urban Resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, insti-
tutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt and 
grow, no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks 
they experience.5

Unemployment

66,602 70,073

64,305

Formal jobs have 
been gained

One of the social issues that has im-
pacted  the  city  is  unemployment, 
which  worsened 
in  two  specific 
periods.  Between  2001  and  2003, 
66,602 formal jobs were lost, and be-
tween 2008 and 2009, 70,073 formal 
jobs were lost due to the world eco-

nomic  recession.  From  2012  to  the 
present, the city has just barely reco-
vered 64,305 formal jobs. Beyond in-
creasing the number of jobs in indus-
try,  the  most  important  challenge  is 
to improve wages, as most are below 
the poverty line.

Extreme Weather 

Juarez  is  located  in  a  semi-desert  zone, 
with  extreme  weather  and  summer  tem-
peratures that exceed 40 ºC (104 ºF), with 
low humidity, while in winter the tempera-
ture drops below 0 ºC (32 ºF). Historically,  

the  minimum  registered  temperature  was 
-22 °C o -7,6 °F). During spring and fall, tem-
peratures are mild. Winds with speeds abo-
ve  40  km/h  (24  mi/hr)  are  always  present 
and nights can be very chilly (IMIP, 2010).

Ciudad  Juarez  suffered  the  most  severe 
social crisis in its history during the 2006 
–  2012  administration,  mainly  due  to  the 
Federal  Government’s  effort  to  combat 
drug trafficking During this period, crimes 
such  as  kidnapping,  extortion  and  homi-
cide increased. In 2009 there were 2,449 
homicides. In 2010 there were 2,932 and  

in 2011, 1,552 were reported. In the last few 
years,  due  to  various  strategies  and  the 
joint  efforts  of  the  three  levels  of  gover-
nment and civil society, there has been a 
significant reduction in violence, especia-
lly  in  the  number  of  reported  homicides. 
In 2012, there were 751 homicides, while in 
2013 there were only 485.

Femicides

Starting  in  1993,  Ciudad  Juarez 
became known worldwide for the 
disappearances  of  women  and 
its  high  rate  of  femicides.  There 
was a significant increase in 2009 
(164), 2010 (304) and 2011 (195), 
years  that  coincide  with  the  war 
against  drug  trafficking.By  the 

year 2009, the femicide rate was 
19.1%  for  every  100,000  women, 
compared  with  the  rest  of  the 
country, where the rate was 2.5% 
for every 100,000 between 2004 
and 2009 (Small Arms Survey re-
search, 2012). This tragic history, 
known  as  Las  muertas  de  Jua-

rez    (The  dead  women  of  Jua-
rez), left a mark on the city and 
brought civil society together to 
reduce  the  femicide  rate.  It  also 
led to the creation of the Ciudad 
Juarez  Forensic  Sciences  Labo-
ratory  to  help  solve  these  and 
other crimes.

In 2017, the city had almost 1.4 million inhabi-

Of  the  employed  and  economically  active 
population (PeA), 39.86% earned between 
zero and two minimum wages, while 32.79% 

had to earn between two and four minimum 
wages. Based on these figures, finding a de-
cent home and affordable transportation is 
just out of the question for many Juarez re-
sidents. According to a study conducted by 

Colegio de la Frontera Norte in 2016, 
85 zones have been identified as prio-
rity areas for investment and reducing 
the conditions of poverty. The zones 
are  located  in  the  western  and  sou-

thwestern sections of  the city, where 
the greatest economic, infrastructure 
and transportation deficiencies exist, 
as well as where the population has a 
limited level of education.

Developing  
the Strategy

RESILIENT JUAREZ

Juarez Resilience Strategy has the goal of 

keeping essential city functions operating 

during a crisis and of creating a resilient 

model with actions that will ensure the city’s 

capacity to respond to environmental, social 

and economic challenges.

     The Resilience Strategy encourages a long-term, 
cross-cutting view that will help the government, 
private sector, civil society as well as ordinary 
citizens to understand and address acute shoc-
ks and chronic stresses in a structured way at 
all levels (federal, state and municipal). The resi-

lience  challenge must be addressed in a holistic 
way that integrates the views of all stakeholders 
and takes into account all of the challenges fa-
cing Ciudad Juarez. In September 2015, the three 
phases for implementing the Juarez Resilience 
Strategy began. 

To develop activities and identify 
priorities, the following elements 
were evaluated:

3.1 Elements  
of the Strategy

The Strategy sets priorities and de-
velops resilience measures to im-
prove the lives of Juarez inhabitants 
by building a more equitable socie-
ty and focusing on the groups that 
are most vulnerable to the risks and 
challenges of the 21st century.

The essential 
components 
of the Juarez 
Resilience 
Strategy 

40

The building of resilience is an inclusi-
ve process based on the participation of 
stakeholders from various levels of gover-
nment (municipality, city, state, federa-
tion) and from the academic community, 
civil society, and companies or represen-
tatives of the private sector, as well as on 
multilateral and bilateral cooperation with 
development organizations. 

The Strategy builds the city’s adaptive 
capacities to face environmental cha-
llenges, such as climate change, and 
chronic stresses that are risks to the fu-
ture sustainability of the city, such as 
environmental degradation, lack of mo-
bility, and deteriorating, ,and air quality.

Various territorial (city/municipality/region) risks to which the city  
is exposed.

The quality, integrity and reliability of information about the city’s re-
silience needs and opportunities..

The level of understanding of resilience challenges and opportunities.
 

The existing decision-making processes as well as existing strategies, 
programs and actions that build resilience.

The commitment and acceptance by key stakeholders.
 

The capacity and openness of government and civil society regarding 
the innovation, new ideas and paradigm changes needed to build up an 
adaptive capacity to face chronic stresses and respond to acute shocks.

The methodology proposed by 100RC, which will be described in  
more detail.

Diagnostic

Diagnosing the city’s resilience involved a review 
of government and academic publications; iden-
tification of stakeholders;, semi-structured inter-
views  and  surveys;  perception  workshops  and 
workshops on physical assets, stresses and shoc-
ks; and an inventory of the resilience-building ac-
tions and programs already in place(Phase I).
In 2016, risk assessment exercises were conducted 
with city staff and interested stakeholders throu-
gh workshops, community walks, and reviews of 
existing plans and data. In addition, 273 surveys 
and 10 interviews were conducted with stakehol-
ders from civil society, academia, government, 
and the  private sector. The outcomes were as-

sessed with the toolkit developed by 100RC and 
AECOM6 to  determine  the  city’s  infrastructure 
assets and the interrelationship between acute 
shocks and chronic stresses and the city’s level of 
vulnerability. With this process some of the most 
relevant assets for building resilience in the city 
were identified.

6. The analysis of inputs was conducted using 
a toolkit developed by AECOM, an international 
consulting firm that is a strategic partner of 100RC.

03  Developing the Strategy44RESILIENT JUAREzAssets are defined as tangible goods owned by the 
city-that are part of the system that enables the city 
to function. These assets are critical to maintaining 
the population’s quality of life. They may be economic 
natural, urban, social or technological infrastructure.

Public parks and recreational areas are promi-
nent assets. On the other hand, management of 
assets has a low level of service or maintenance, 
as it is the case of mobile network or telephone 
networks, allocation of natural gas, sewage sys-
tems, irrigation canals, river ways and water sto-
rage, among the main ones.

The  toolkit  was  also  used  to  analyze  the  fo-
llowing to determine stresses and shocks.

Risks and threats to the city.
Potential  shocks  and  impacts  of  serious 
breakdowns in the city’s basic infrastructure.

With stakeholders from various areas and sectors, we identified 
acute shocks that impacted the city’s resilience, its institutions, 
and the support systems necessary to keep it functioning.

Shocks

The results of the analysis show that two of 
the main stresses on the city—lack of access 
to basic utilities and lack of infrastructure—
would greatly impact the city’s capacity to re-

cover quickly in the event  of an acute shock. 
Stresses such as deteriorating critical infrastruc-
ture or downturns in the local economy would 
also increase in the event of an acute shock.

Ciudad Juarez guarantees the right of its citizen, both individua-

lly and collectively, to participate in government through the va-

rious mechanisms and instruments specified by the Constitution 

and the Law. The goal is to enable citizens to have an impact on 

the government’s decision-making process and on the oversi-

ght, management, and execution of political, administrative, ur-

ban, environmental and transportation initiatives. Another goal 

is  to  guarantee  equal  access  for  all  citizens  to  basic  services, 

such as water, public spaces, and economic, social, cultural, and 

national resources that will improve their quality of life.

Resilient Juarez03  Developing the strategyStrategy Pillars

The discovery areas were constrained by laws and 
public policies. However, the pillars reflect, throu-
gh a lens of resilience, the ideals and aspirations 
that underpin the Resilience Strategy. The pillars 
form a strong framework for a complex system of 

actions. Every pillar is based on the ideas shared 
by local stakeholders and global 100RC members 
who provided their knowledge, experience, and 
expertise to help with the development of the 
Juarez Resilience Strategy. Here are the pillars:

A city that works towards achieving a strong, 
diversified economy that functions in harmony 
with sustainable development principles while 

remaining competitive. 

A city with a resilient planning model, which 

bases urban planning and development 
regulations on the city’s specific context, 
features and challenges, with social and 

community cohesion as its goal.

A society that protects the environment and 
is prepared to face threats to it, that takes into 
account its desert climate and surroundings, 

and that explores various resource 

management methodologies.

A safe and empowered community that 

welcomes cultural diversity, strengthens the 

sense of belonging, and fosters laws and 

programs to empower an informed, involved, 

committed and responsible citizenry.

4.1 Strategy 
structure

The  Juarez  Resilience  Strategy  is  a 
tactical guide for government agencies 
acting  on  behalf  of  the  public  good 
to  decision  making  with  a  resilient 
approach.  It  is  also  a  framework  of 
actions  to  ensure  that  citizens  are 
prepared  to  face  any  stress  or  shock 
to  the  city.  The  Strategy  is  inclusive, 
and  emphasizes  the  participation  of 
vulnerable  groups,  such  as  women, 
young people, and children. To achieve 
the  goal  of  inclusiveness,  human  and 
economic resources must be mobilized.
The Strategy consists of 4 pillars, 11 goals 
and 33 actions. The four pillars are the 
Strategy’s backbone. They reflect the 
values of Juarez society and will act as a 
guide to achieving the ideal of a resilient 
city. Eleven long-term goals underpin 
the Strategy’s concrete actions and are 
directly connected to the pillars, The 33 
actions represent specific projects and 
tactical activities that will help Juarez 
meet  the  Strategy’s  objectives.  The 
actions  vary  from  simple  to  complex, 
and  they  may  be  undertaken  in  the 
short, medium or long term. In addition 
to the actions, this document describes 
related initiatives by other groups in civil 
society,  in  government  departments, 
and in academic institutions, and also 
introduces some of the projects fostered 
by the Resilience Office.

As  the  name  Inclusive  Juarez 
suggests,  this  pillar  stresses  the 
importance of citizen participation 
in the creation and development of 
the city’s urban spaces—it essentially 
aims at getting them involved in the 
design of their own habitat. Juarez is 
a border city with almost 1.4 million 
inhabitants who are primarily young 
people.  The  city  is  also  a  mixture 
of immigrant cultures from various 
parts of the country. The Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment determined 
that  the  city’s  infrastructure  and 
services  are  insufficient,  that 
income  levels  are  generally  low, 
and  that  the  population  is  largely 
uneducated.  In  addition,  the 
society  is  greatly  polarized,  with 
marginalized  populations  living  in 
the  most  vulnerable  areas  of  the 
city, such as the outskirts of Juarez. 
The challenges only increase as the 
social context in which many of the 
citizens of Juarez live is explored. 

The high rates of violence in recent 
decades  and  the  lack  of  public 
security have increased the citizens’ 
sense of isolation and reluctance to 
interact with the world outside their 
homes. This is especially the case for 
women, given the alarming rates of 
femicides and disappearances. 
Thus, the resilience challenge for this 
pillar directly focuses on citizens and 
their interaction with their immediate 
environment. Inclusive Juarez seeks 
to transform and improve the living 
conditions  of  the  inhabitants  of 
Juarez by restoring public spaces. 
The pillar aims to make these urban 
areas not only places where positive 
social interaction can take place but 
where women, who are one of the 
most vulnerable groups in the city, 
can feel safe.

Green Spaces 
/ Parks

These are open 
spaces with trees, 
where everyone 
is free to enjoy 
walking, relaxing, 
and recreation. They 
usually  have paths, 
places for relaxation, 
and playgrounds 
for children. 

Juarez

Square

This is an open space where people can 
gather together and engage in various 
civic, cultural, recreational, political or 
social activities.

Chamizal

Ridge

This is the road, 
pathway or central strip 
of a wide avenue or 
street and is generally 
embellished with trees 
and plants. It divides the 
traffic going in different 
directions and keeps 
vehicles from straying 
into the opposite lane.

Roundabout

This is a road 
construction designed 
to facilitate road 
crossings and to reduce 
accidents. Typically 
round in design, 
these spaces are 
often planted and are 
also used for various 
activities.

Juarez has an average of 5.6 square meters of green space per inhabitant, which is 

below the 9 square meters of green space per inhabitant identified by the World 

Health Organization as the optimum ratio.

According to the analysis conducted by the Resilience Office during the Preliminary 

Resilience Assessment, current conditions in the city have created a need to foster 

positive social interaction through increasing the number of green spaces in which 

that interaction can take place.

One response to this challenge is a project called Resilient Parks (RP). An RP is a 

space that brings together green infrastructure, urban agriculture, and native plants, 

and that provides a place where artistic, cultural, and sports activities can take place.

An alliance between the Municipality and SEDATU will finance this project. The 

Resilience  Office,  in  collaboration  with  the  Planning  and  Assessment  General 

Direction and Social Development General Direction, will identify the parks in 

vulnerable areas of the city that will be included in the project. In the first stage, 

in the period from 2018 to 2019, the General Direction department expects to 

create five RPs in the city. This action, which is described in the city’s Sustainable 

Urban Development Plan 2016, makes the creation of inclusive spaces a priority. In 

addition, as this is an action linked to the Colima Resilience Office, the Planning and 

Assessment General Direction will design a neighborhood intervention guide and 

explore urban design methodologies, such as tactical urbanism, with the neighbors

The annual contest “Let’s enhance a public space” is an open invitation to experts 

and people interested in architecture and urban planning to participate in optimizing 

and  improving  their  areas,  in  building  the  city’s  resilience  elements  into  their 

proposals as well as planning and design processes.

The  Municipal  Government,  academic  institutions  and  international  bodies 

collaborate in putting on the contest. To foster intersector inclusion, they bring 

together experts to act as judges and to assess and take part in the process. 

In the second half of 2017, the first contest proposal, to conduct an intervention 

for Juan Gabriel Great Plaza was launched. Rebuild by Design, a 100RC partner, 

facilitated the participatory design that was adopted to implement this initiative. 

This first version of the contest had valuable results and involved the Gehl Institute, 

which monitored the process and acted as judge for the projects. The winning 

project  incorporated  resilience  elements,  including  green  infrastructure,  bike 

paths, eco-technologies, and a participatory, collaborative design process that was 

sensitive to the community’s culture and history. The first stage of the project will 

be implemented in the second half of 2018 and will end in early 2019.

An action linked to this contest is the creation of a public fund to implement the 

winning project using funds primarily from the Municipal Government.

was conducted on 
September 11 and 
12,2017.

More than 100 

students participated 

in the process during 

the workshop.

The goal of the workshop 

was to provide tools and 

methodologies for the analysis 

and renovation of public 

spaces by Rebuild By Design 

and the Gehl Institute.

The second phase, 
from October 20, 
2017, to January 
18, 2018, involved 
the development 
and launch of 
the invitation to 
the contest. 

After  identifying  the  existing  challenges  in 
the  public  spaces  of  Juarez  and  the  lack 
of  social  cohesion  and  public  life,  the  city 
developed  alliances  with  Rebuild  by  Design 
and Gehl Institute to create an innovative and 
collaborative design proposal.

Rebuild by Design focuses on analysing 
and  reinventing  urban  spaces  through  a 
community approach.

Gehl Institute is an international organization 
whose mission is to transform the way in which 
cities are shaped by making public life the driver 
for design, policy, and governance.

Description:

The project fosters social responsibility within industries, companies and local businesses 

through the adoption of common-use spaces such as parks, corridors and pathways. 

These  entities  will  be  able  to  impact  these  types  of  urban  spaces  through  legal 

instruments such as coordination agreements to create safe green zones that can be 

used for entertainment. By encouraging solidarity and social responsibility, the Economic 

Development General Direction’s goal is to have a company or a maquiladora restore 

and maintain a park in a low-income district and/or parks located around their facilities 

for the benefit of both their workers and the community. The Economic Development 

General Direction office is leading this action and has developed a list of these spaces, 

including their specific features and boundaries, in order to facilitate the adoption process. 

The Economic Development General Direction invites companies to demonstrate their

This action includes two phases:

The Economic Development General Direction creates and updates a catalogue of 

available spaces that both lack infrastructure and are adjacent to companies. Given 

their location, these spaces have the potential for a high social impact. 

2.  The Economic Development General Direction fosters and creates tax incentives 

for companies joining the program.

By late 2018, the Economic Development General Direction expects that at least 10 parks 

will have a sponsoring company that will provide the required maintenance, fences, mesh 

canopy, lighting, playgrounds for children, and bathrooms, among other benefits.

This action to develop cultural, artistic, and educational skills during childhood and 

youth is a necessary part of building community resilience. The Resilience Office and 

the Juarez Municipality Culture Institute created this initiative for children and teenagers 

at the primary school level (6 to 15 years old). The goal is to foster the development of 

creative as well as intellectual and personal growth through artistic and cultural activities. 

Indirectly, this initiative will also foster civic values based on common roots and identity.

The Resilience Office and the Juarez Municipality Culture Institute will deliver an art 

workshop at the schools for one month and the workshop will conclude with a feature 

representation of the learnings.

During 2017 the international organization MasterPeace, using its project “Wall of 

Connections,” collaborated in a pilot project for this initiative. The goal was to train 

sixth-grade students in recreational activities (in this case, a painting workshop using 

the airbrush technique). The students were from Cuitlahuac, a grade school in a 

vulnerable area of the city, and the workshop ended with the collective construction 

of a mural in which students depicted their view of the city and applied their new skills.

The project’s success underscored the need to encourage and expand the personal 

development of the children of Juarez. Projects such as this can better prepare 

children to become citizens committed to their communities. The Resilience Office 

and the Juarez Municipality Culture Institute plan to implement this project in at least 

two schools in every six-month term. The workshops will start in the first half of 2018. 

The Resilience Office and the Juarez Municipality Culture Institute will pursue alliances

in Mexico and inspiring thousands of young people, 
mainly in Mexico City. Through projects, campaigns, 
and spaces for dialogue, MasterPeace has been 
inspiring young people to act and work for peace, 
primarily through the arts.

In May 2017, MasterPeace 
joined the Juarez 
Resilience Office to 
develop a project called 
“Walls of Connections,”  
a global MasterPeace 
campaign to paint 100 
walls in more than 40 
countries. The goal is 
to turn walls that divide 
communities into symbols 
of connection.

 The end of the project 
was simple: to get a 
connection wall. However, 
to add a resilience 
element, the Resilience 
Office organized a spray 
paint workshop before 
the mural was created.

Description:

Under the Sustainable Urban Development Plan 2016, about 20% of the urban area 

of Juarez is vacant land or wasteland. This situation is not only one that can lead to 

violence but it also negatively impacts public security and the urban image of the 

city. This initiative focuses on increasing owner awareness of the empty lots they 

have in urban areas and encouraging them to allow temporary use of these lots as 

public spaces, mainly in areas where there are none. This action fosters the creation 

of green spaces that improve the quality of life throughout the city. The Urban De-

velopment General Direction is creating a mechanism that will provide incentives 

to wasteland owners to join the green space creation project.

The Urban Development General Direction is the agency in charge of regulating ur-

ban growth in the city and will be the project lead in a collaboration with the Plan-

ning and Assessment General Direction, the Public Services General Direction, the 

Public Works General Direction, and the Municipal Treasury Department to prepare 

and publish tax and legal incentives. In addition, to establish guidelines for these in-

centives, the Urban Development General Direction will publish a call to participate 

in 2018 that will be targeted to various sectors of civil society, city neighborhoods, 

and research organizations interested in the project:

1.  Operation of the initiative. 

2.  Legal support instruments. 

The purpose of this action is to ensure that this urban area becomes a compact,

The Municipal Government has developed several virtual applications (apps) for 

mobile devices to increase the safety of women and other citizens in the city. 

Examples of these apps are “No estoy sola” (I am not alone) and “Seguridad 

Ciudadana” (Citizen Safety), which enable users to make emergency phone calls 

for assistance and safety.

This initiative fosters the creation and distribution of apps and the adoption 

of new virtual trends. In addition, the Municipal Government, jointly with the 

Municipal Institute for Women and the Public Security Direction, will create local 

and international social media campaigns to encourage the use of these apps.

This action will reduce the current communications gap between the Municipal 

Government and the city’s citizens during emergencies and other situations.

The Municipal Government expects to develop new applications that can offer 

a better response when the city needs to address environmental events, traffic 

jams, vehicle traffic, and other challenges. The Municipal Government will invite 

the community and everyone interested in developing these apps to participate, 

will encourage more development of this type of communications technology, 

and will capitalize on local talent.

With this action, the Resilience Office will create a program to identify and train 

community leaders as part of the municipality’s planning processes. Identifying 

leaders  who  can  successfully  implement  programs  and  actions  within  their 

communities is critically important, especially as these community leaders will 

have local contacts, understand local issues, and be involved in alliances with 

various stakeholders within their communities. This action facilitates collaboration 

between government agencies and the city’s communities, and strengthens the 

ties between them.

In the past the women of Juarez have shown a greater commitment to programs 

that focus on improving their quality of life, so this action targets them first.

The Resilience Office will conduct this work jointly with the city’s network 

of  neighborhoods,  which  have  experience  in  identifying  leaders  in  various 

districts. The community leadership program will include public assemblies, 

citizenship training seminars, and other types of support activities. By late 

2018, the Resilience Office will have program operation guidelines and a pilot 

project in place.

Juarez is known globally for the large number of feminicides committed 

in the city. To address this, the Municipal Institute for Women developed 

a project called “Safe Corridor for Women.” This project targets the city’s 

historical district, which is an area that has been marked by violence and 

a lack of security. It is also a place where many women have disappeared.

Besides  the  office  of  the  Municipal  Institute  for  Women,  the  project 

includes safe areas, panic buttons, and policed safety and pink zones 

that give priority to women and girls. The motto of the project is “If it 

is safe for women, it is safe for everyone.” The project signifies a radical 

change in the city’s response to violence against women and a new vision 

for achieving safety and security in the city.

The extraordinarily high rates of violence in the city in the last 10 years require trans-

formative actions to address public security and violence. However, this challenge 

is not exclusive to the city but should be explored and addressed on regional, na-

tional, and international levels.

During the Resilience Summit held in 2017, the CRO and representatives of cities 

with public security challenges met and agreed on the creation of an International 

Safety and Social Inclusion Network (ISSIN).

Cities included in the network in this first stage are:

•	 Mexico: Juarez, Colima, and CDMX

•	

•	

•	

Estados Unidos: Chicago, Nueva Orleans and San Luis.

Colombia: Medellín and Cali.

Argentina: Santa Fe. 

The  Resilience  Office,  working  jointly  with  the  Municipal  Institute  for 

•	 Municipal Institute for Women

The purpose of the network is to create a permanent communication channel 

Women, will design various actions, such as a proposal for a sustainable 

gender-oriented urban design, courses on women’s empowerment, and 

the establishment of urban orchards to help families economically. To get 

the project off the ground, the Resilience Office will liaise with other 100RC 

cities to benefit from their experience and to learn best practices. Through 

this international collaboration and knowledge sharing, it is hoped that 

the project will achieve a new level of security for the women of Juarez 

and transform the world’s negative view of the city.

Safe Corridor 
for Women

The Municipal Government is dedicated to 
preventing gender violence and to recovering the 
historical district of Juarez.

In the last 
24 years

1,572

femicides

in 2017 only, there 
was a record of

60

28

femicides

women murdered 
and 23 women 
disappeared

Given these figures, the 
Municipal Institute for 
Women proposed the 
creation of a safe corridor 
for women in the historical 
district of Juarez. 

Strategies like this aim to reduce the number of  violent acts 
against women. Secure spaces include panic buttons, public 
security, and interactive digital stations. The Municipal 
Government’s goal is to empower women and their families 
through artistic, cultural, sports and economic activities.

The goal is the creation of 
an urban environment where 
women feel safe and are 
completely free to exercise 
their rights as citizens

Transforming the existing 
image of the city on gender 
issues is a parallel goal.

App I am 
not alone

This is an application for mobile telephones that 
enables users to keep family and friends informed 
in an emergency or dangerous situation. It is a 
part of a state-of-the-art effort by the independent 
Municipal  Administration  to  use  technological 
tools to increase public security and lower the 
safety risk in Juarez neighborhoods

The app 

is free.

The app allows the 

user to pre-set it to 

contact five people in 

case of an emergency

No Internet service is 

required. Just network 

and cell phone credit 

need to be available

The app is 

compatible with 

Android devices 

and will soon be 

available for iOS

The app has had more than 50,000 downloads 

from Google Play and has 20,000 active 

accounts. It has been downloaded not only in 

Mexico, but also in Spain and Chile.

The current release of the app 

is the 1.2 version, which has 

enhanced  settings and minor bug 

fixes for  sending SMS.

Alerts will be automatically sent when the cell 

phone is shaken. The alerts are in the form 

of a text message that can be customized to 

request help The text message also sends the 

geo-referred location of the person in peril.

The app was officially launched on July 5, 2017, 

and the average user rating is 4. 0.

Prosperous

A strong, diverse and competitive economy

Context
Prosperous Juarez 

Industrial park *

This is a geographically limited area 

that has been especially designed for 

manufacturing plants (maquiladoras) with 

respect to location, infrastructure, facilities 

and services, and that is managed by a 

permanent administration.

Socioeconomic 
level:

Juarez is strategically located at the border of 
Mexico-and  the  United  States.  At  this  border, 
there  is  a  continuous  flow  of  capital  from  the 
export maquiladora industry (IME). This location 
encourages investments of all kinds and attracts 
many people seeking better working conditions. 
Consequently, there is a high demand for services, 
networks, and infrastructure, which is resulting in 
an ongoing expansion of urban sprawl. IME has 
defined  the  current  face  of  the  city.  Between 
2000  and  2010,  the  city  attracted  75%  of  the 
direct foreign investment in Chihuahua State and 
was the largest contributor to the state’s gross 
domestic product at 43% (Padilla, 2012: 898). 
Although the IME sector provides 66.5% of the 
formal jobs in the city, IME’s environmental impact 
degrades the city and pollutes its ecosystem and 
natural resources irreversibly.
The figures in the urban competitiveness index 
for 2016 showed a city with a low unemployment 
rate. Nevertheless, the challenges at the border 
are not lack of employment, but the low income 
level  of  almost  40%  of  the  population,  which 
only  earn  the  minimum  wage  and  lack  even 
a  rudimentary  level  of  education.  The  school 
desertion rate is 6% in secondary school and 17% 
in high school. Per data provided by Coneval, by 
2015 39.9% of the population had incomes that 
fell below the poverty line, 14.5% had low incomes 
and few opportunities due to a lack of skills and 
inadequate education, and 13.7% suffered due to 
lack of access to food.

40% 

is paid minimum wage.

6% is the school desertion 

rate in secondary school.

17% is the school 

desertion rate in high school.

39.9% of the population 

had  incomes  below  the 
poverty line, per Coneval data 
for 2015.

This  pillar  focuses  on  the  need  to  diversify  the 
current  economic  model  through  innovation, 
competitiveness, and respect for the environment. 
Needed are green jobs that are of a better quality 
and better paid if a more sustainable future is to be 
achieved. Another aspect of this pillar is the initiative 
to transform the international image of Juarez by 
improving conditions in the city so that it becomes 
known for its culture and history.

Maquilas *

These are manufacturing facilities conducting 

industrial activities such as production, 

transformation, assembly, storage and 

distribution. These companies operate 

internationally, as they typically import raw 

materials and export products made from 

them to other countries.

Women have been seriously affected by the rates of violence in Jua-

rez. Today, however, women have turned that challenge into a catalyst 

for change. A range of  projects are now encouraging women to get 

involved in the local economy. According to the National Institute of 

Entrepreneurs, to date only 19% of the country’s entrepreneurs are 

women. This action is therefore a commitment to support and foster 

an entrepreneurial culture and to create workshops designed specifi-

cally for women.  Participants in these workshops will be empowered 

to contribute to the city’s entrepreneurship and economic growth. 

The action plan includes the following elements: 

1.  Training in business entrepreneurship

2.  Skills training in business promotion and development.

3.  Preparation of pre-incubation and incubation proposals.

The Municipal Institute for Women and local community centers will 

coordinate and conduct the project. At the state level, the Economic 

Development and Innovation Direction will establish collaboration and 

funding agreements.

encourage donations of food in good condition to civic organizations, which will in turn 

channel the food to community soup kitchens or social assistance centers.

For this action, the Resilience Office requires the involvement and collaboration of a range

RESILIENT JUAREZ

Goals:

3.1.
Civic Rights  

Expected Outcome: The city of Juarez 
will be an example of resilient planning. 
The city’s historical district will be 
transformed into an urban area where 
the fundamental rights of all citizens are 
respected and enforced and will be a 
hub for tourism, business and culture.

3.2.
Resilient Planning
 
Expected Outcome: To its 
vulnerability in the long term, Juarez 
will renew its strategic planning 
processes, led by a resilience office 
that will synthesize the views of 
local government, the private sector, 
academia and citizens.

3.3.
Alternate Connectivity and  
Mobility Plan

Expected Outcome: Juarez will 
be a leader in the planning and 
implementation of alternative modes 
of safe, efficient and affordable 
transportation and will reduce travel 
times in the city.

Context
Integrated Juarez

The city of Juarez has undergone exponential ur-
ban growth in the last few decades, a situation 
that has resulted in poor management of servi-
ces and resources, which in turn has increased 
the city’s challenges. Juarez should have strate-
gies in place to better connect it with sections of 
the city that have been cut off from city services 
and resources. The city should adopt new, inno-
vative urban management strategies and foster 
alternative and sustainable mobility systems, es-
pecially, for the existing industrial parks and the 
area along its northern border, which have the 
highest employment density. 
At present there is a disconnection between the 
regulations on growth and development in the 
city and the urban reality. Despite the many re-
gulations on urban development put in place 
since the late 1970s, the city still faces mobility 
challenges, lacks a vision for sustainable grow-
th, and has no laws or regulations to guide urban 
development decisions and/or the execution of 
urban interventions. 
The city lacks a multi-modal transportation sys-
tem, which results in a poor transportation ne-
twork that does not provide proper service to all 
users. All modes of public transportation in the 
city share a common destination, downtown. By 
2014, 13 million trips were made by car and the-
re were 14 million kilometers traveled.11  Juarez is 
now designing a Comprehensive Mobility Plan 
that will bring together the BRT12 and bicycle la-
nes. Given the complexity of the challenge, the 
plan is moving very slowly. Meanwhile the res-

toration of the Historic District is a milestone of 
great social and urban importance. Not only has 
the district been at the center of the city’s history, 
it is the site where the first official contact with 
the United States took place and where buildings 
of national significance still stand.

Historic District

Misiones

Suroriente

Despite the deterioration the Historic District has 
suffered and the negative image it has had, the area 
is still economically active and socially vibrant.  
The Research and Planning Municipal Institute 
(IMIP) took the first step by preparing the Mas-
ter Plan of Ciudad Juarez Historic District. The 
plan, which is based on a detailed analysis of the 
area, proposes strategic actions per area of acti-
vity. In addition, the Planning Direction created 
the Historic District Board of Patrons to advise 
in this makeover of the city’s image and to pro-
pose projects and raise funds to execute them. 
The board will provide new funding options and 
guarantee transparency on project approval and 
resource allocation. In short, this example of in-
novative urban planning is a path to guarantee-
ing full access to the city by all its inhabitants. 
Public security, forums for the peaceful exchange 
of ideas, collective participation in urban deve-
lopment and planning, and exercises in solidari-
ty are also required. The common interest of the 
individual and the right to property are embe-
dded in the individual right to the city, which 
implies the right to a fair, environmentally sus-
tainable use of the city’s resources and services 
(Sanchez-Almanza, 2012).
The actions under this pillar address the right to 
the city, the integration of resilient planning, the 
drive toward sustainable mobility, and the reha-
bilitation of the Historic District.

Description:

The first Charter of the Right to the City, which was born in 2005 at the UN-Ha-

bitat Cities Summit, claimed the right to the city as a human right. The document 

frames the top challenges in physical, economic, social, environmental, political 

and cultural terms. 

More than 99% of the population of Juarez lives within the city’s urban sprawl and 

about 40% of cannot afford a decent home. This situation requires development 

a document that enshrines the principles and strategic foundation of the right to 

the city: full exercise of human rights for all and democratic participation in the ma-

nagement of the city; the city’s social responsibility for its urban spaces; equality, 

non-discrimination, and special protection for vulnerable groups and individuals; 

commitment of the private sector to social equality, and solidary economy enhan-

cement. The Resilience Office must consider the following in creating the charter:

1. 

Creation of an invitation to  multi- and inter-sector subject matter experts

2.  Creation of forums that foster the exchange of ideas and experience and to identify 

needs, such as the rights to housing, to access to basic services, to mobility, to trans-

portation and to energy

3.  Establishment of a common agenda and strategic issues

4.  Developing a Charter of the Right to the City that addresses local conditions.

5.  Signing of the document by local authorities, so that the Charter is accepted as the 

governing principle in the building of an equitable and inclusive urban environment.

The Resilience Office plans to publish and introduce the Charter by 2020.

Strategic action: 

CDMX Charter for 
the Right to the City 

“The development of Mexico City Charter for Civic Rights reflects a 
change in the city’s democratic process by unifying enforcement and 
exercise of human rights through  a political-social pact between ci-
vil society, autonomous bodies, the government, educational entities, 
among others”

Emilio Álvarez de Icaza.

The Charter is an instrument that de-
fines the different obligations and the 
public policy and management princi-
ples of the urban movement. The offi-
cial signing of the Charter took place
on 13 July 2010 and was executed 
by local authorities from the execu-
tive, legislative, and judicial levels of 
government as well as by represen-
tatives of civil society and indepen-
dent public organizations.

The charter was the result of citizens’ aspirations 
for a democratic city in which human rights are duly 
enforced, and it was inspired by the international 
debate on the Right to the City.

The document proposes a series of public policy measu-
res as well as commitments by various stakeholders, and 
it details not only what the majority of the population 
wants, but how their desires are to be fulfilled and what 
role each sector in society must play.

The Charter is founded on 6 strategic elements:

Description:

1.  The Resilience Office will consider making the designation of a “Historic District” a muni-

cipal declaration (Perimeter A). It must consider the expert knowledge regarding the unique 

features of city areas to set a discussion on the matter: technical reviews institutional level 

and forums/workshops to discuss expectations and potential outcomes. 

2. The review of the Historic District Master Plan will allow consideration of the establi-

shment of a buffer area (perimeter B), referred to in the 1950s as the “consolidated city.”

3. The Planning and Assessment General Direction will conduct a forum (Historical evolu-

tion of border cities: What do we want to preserve and why?) with the participation of na-

tional agencies and border communities (INAH, UACJ, COLEF, UNM Albuquerque, NMSU 

Las Cruces). This forum will review examples of historic preservation in border cities and 

will analyze the policies they are implementing. The first result of the forum will be a publi-

cation on preservation in border cities. 

4. The Resilience Office will Promote the actions of urban conservation of the old roads within Jua-

rez urban footprint, to propose  to the Conalmex-UNESCO an extension of the declaration of the 

World Heritage of the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (CRTA). This requires hiring a technical study 

(dossier) and holding meetings with representatives of the State Government. It is suggested that 

the city collaborates with the private consulting office that formed the first CRTA file.

5. The Resilience Office will extend an invitation to a workshop on transforming the urban 

image of strategic areas inside the consolidated city (possible topics: use of plots, how to 

balance utilities with housing, height of buildings and colors of facades, pedestrian/auto-

mobile mobility). The contract could be executed by private consultants and the Architec-

the Historic District will provide new funding options while ensuring 
clarity and transparency in the project approval and resource allo-
cation processes.
The Planning and Assessment General Direction will take the fo-

1.  Develop the content of the regulation.

2.  Conduct meetings and workshops with key stakeholders and 

UNESCO-MX.

3.  Prepare a draft of the regulation.

Between 2000 and 2015, urban sprawl in Juarez grew by 40%, while the population grew 

by barely 1%. With a density of 42 inhabitants per hectare, the unplanned development 

causes those who live and work in Juarez to invest more time and resources on traveling 

because public transportation and the road infrastructure are inadequate (Bicycle Mobi-

also reduce travel costs and pollution from vehicle emissions, which will have a po-

sitive impact on the environment.

To implement this action, the Urban Development General Direction will:

1.  Work with IMPI and suggest technical guidelines to urban designers preparing 

various proposals.

2.  Foster and engage in participatory design.

mobility: 

“Rides with a Purpose” 
and the “Recreational 
Bicycle Lane”

Urban mobility is a challenge affecting most mod-
ern cities, a fact that has encouraged the search 
for new transportation models and systems to 
meet citizens’ needs. Sustainable mobility is an 
increasingly popular concept because of its eco-
nomic, physical and environmental benefits. 
Proposals such as “Rides with a Purpose” and the 
“Recreational Bicycle Lane” are designed to make 
a huge impact in the community through the use 
of bicycles as an alternative to cars and to encour-
age the use of bicycles in a safe manner.

To transform mobility in Juarez, plans, programs and 
public policies that encourage the use of bicycles as an 
alternate means of transportation must be supported.

“Rides with a Purpose” 

is an initiative of the 
Resilience Office that 
promotes the use of 

bicycles within the city, not 
just for recreation but for 
the health and well-being 

of everyone. 

Its purpose was to 
spread the word 
about the heat 

waves

across the region

 Its purpose was to 
collect donations of 
food and groceries 

for the NGO 

Extiende tus Alas.

The Recreational Bicycle 
Lane is an initiative of the 
Municipal Government 
proposing to close a 
street in the Historic 
District every Sunday for 
recreational use only.

During 2017, 

two rides 
took place.

The first one, 
“Night Ride 

Against Heat,” 
was on May 19.

The second one, 

“Rides with a 

Purpose: Comedor 
Extiende tus Alas,” 

was on July 28

The project was conducted 
from November 5 to 
December 3 at a stretch of 
Av. 16 de Septiembre between 
8:00 am and 1:00 pm.

Juaritos literario: los 
circuitos de la memoria

The literary map of Ciudad Juarez is a collaborative project that 

tracks literary references in which our city is the star or has an 

important role in the poem, novel or play.

The fictional roles of some 
spaces in the urban landscape 
were behind the creation of tour 
maps –maps of literary trails 
passing through various sites 
that have inspired local authors. 
Visitors to Juarez can take the 
maps and design their own 
walking tours of the city. 

We went out to the streets 
after touring the pages of a 
long written tradition about the 
old Paso del Norte

Day-to-day life in Juarez is 

depicted in literature as a series 
of adventures, mysteries, stresses 
and emotions, which compels us 
to think about ourselves and how 
we live in a metropolis that is full of 

energy and disruptions

The Juaritos Literario collective 
promotes and distributes the 
literary heritage of Ciudad 
Juarez (https://juaritosliterario.
com/), which is a key foundation 
for building a regional identity 
and a sense of rootedness. The 
connections that exist between 
writers, readers and critics start 
when a book is opened. The 
collectives’ literary walks bring 
people together in the avenues, 
plazas and alleys of the city. As 
they walk along, each walker-
reader is able to rekindle images 
and memories from reading the 
book and can also enjoy sharing 
them with others.

Some literary works focus 
on the violence in the city 
at the turn of century, and 

promoting these works would 
not change the city’s image, 
but highlight the sensational 

aspects of that period

However, we believe it would be a mistake to 
avoid remembering the difficulties the city 
once faced. Now we can view these events 
from a certain distance, as we face new 
challenges and work to create a future that 
reflects the memories and lessons of our past 
history. The dynamics of border cities is such 
that they have cycles and alternate between 
times of stability and times of disruption. We 
cannot deny what happened in the past, and 
turning a blind eye to it would be even worse.

“From my field of study, literature, I think 
that reading works that evoke the city are 
the best incentive for remembering the 
past, making sense of grief and getting 
prepared to create a future in which our 
dreams can come true.”

Goals:

4.1.
Making Juarez a Model City of 
Climate Adaptation. 
  
Expected Outcome: Ciudad Juarez will 
adopt an environmental plan reflecting its 
location and resource issues and informed 
by citizen participation. This plan will 
become the basis of a climate action plan 
with specific mitigation and adaptation 
goals as well as a commitment to reducing 
carbon emissions.. 

4.2.
Environmental Education for Citi-
zens and the Private Sector.
  
Expected Outcome: Ciudad Juarez will 
include comprehensive education on 
environmental issues in school curricula 
and entrepreneurial action proposals, 
with the goal of becoming a city that is 
climate neutral.

4.3.
Comprehensive Water Management.
  
Expected Outcome: Ciudad Juarez will 
see a considerable reduction in the floods 
that disrupt traffic flow thanks to the new 
investments in green infrastructure, which 
captures rainfall water and thus reduces water 
consumption and fosters water sustainability.

Rio Grande

As a desert ecosystem (dry and arid), the nor-
thern region of Mexico endures extreme weather 
with documented maximum temperatures of up 
to 45°C and minimum temperatures of -15°C. The 
heat waves in the region are now more frequent 
and last longer every year, increasing the number 
of deaths per year and negatively impacting ener-
gy and natural resources. 
The availability of water from the Rio Grande, 
which is primarily controlled by the Federal Go-
vernment, is a critical challenge in the region, as 
the water is almost entirely restricted to irriga-
tion and agricultural use.. 
The  other  sources  of  potable  water  for  Juarez 
are the Bolson del Hueco and Bolson de la Mesi-
lla aquifers. These underground water bodies pro-
vide drinking water for both cities, and regulation 
and extraction are controlled at the federal level. 
The challenge lies in the fact that the optimum rate 
of consumption has already reached an alarming 
level and in the coming years, the supply of water 
will be reduced. 

The region’s sporadic rainstorms, which cause 
temporary accumulations of rainfall in Juarez due 
to its topographic conditions and infrastructure 
configuration, are another challenge. They dama-
ge the city’s infrastructure, disrupt the transit sys-
tem, and cause public health problems. 
Lastly, pollution levels in the city are increasing 
due to emissions from cars, trucks, buses and 
maquiladoras.  Border  bridges  are  one  of  the 
main sources of pollution, given the large con-
centration of cars waiting to cross into the nei-
ghboring country.
The goals of this pillar are to make the most of 
the potential advantages of living in a desert area, 
use  the  region’s  resources  in  moderation,  and 
help the city preserve its resources for the future 
and better manage its non-renewable resources. 
The goals focus on the need to create awareness 
about the effects of climate change, such as wa-
ter supply shortages, heat waves, and floods, and 
they incorporate resilience as the underlying prin-
ciple for transformational change.

Effects of Urban Growth 
on the Paso del Norte 
Region’s Climate System
Dr. José Luis Sandoval Granados

The doctoral dissertation Effects of Urban Growth on the Paso 
del Norte Region Climate System by Dr. Jose Luis Sandoval 
Granados, which he began in 2010 and completed in 2014, 

assessed the effects of urban growth on the climate system 

based on the relationship between occupation patterns and 

the behavior of the soil surface temperature (SST), which 

determined its environmental feasibility. It set forth the 

following objectives

1

2

3

Identify and classify by remote identification methods the 

growth and urban occupation process in the Paso del Norte 

region for the period from 2000 to 2010.

Assess the SST changes with regards to urban 

occupation patterns in the Paso del Norte region.

Assess the environmental impact of the various urban 

occupation patterns with regards to the SST changes.

The process was based on four approaches: 1) relationship 

between society and nature, 2) geographic, 3) systemic, 

and 4) urban occupation. The methodology was to deve-

lop and create a series of maps and models from which 

conclusions can be reached regarding climate effects on 

urban growth, on the increase in SST, and on soil and its 

relationship to the regional environment.

Lastly, the 30 geo-reference points shown in the Soil Sur-

face Temperature Model (MTSS) for Ciudad Juarez revea-

led an increase in the SST average of these points, ranging 

from 33.5°C in year 2000 to 45.2°C by 2010, with a diffe-

rence of 11.7°C. The maximum temperature registered was 

37.2°C in 2000,* and in 2010 the maximum temperature over 

this same point was 49.7°C, which is a difference of 12.5°C 

above the MCUC.

In identifying and classifying the grow-

th and urban occupation process in 
the Paso del Norte, data showed that 
in 2010 the U.S. already had an area of 
24,272 ha and Mexico only 12,979 ha; 
while by 2010 the U.S. had 36,202 ha 

and Mexico, barely 19,164 ha. With that, 
a greater influence from the U.S. end can 
be observed regarding the urban growth 
phenomenon impact on the region due 
to land use extension, in terms of urban 

constructed area cover distance.

SST records for El Paso, Texas, on the other hand, show a count of 30 points, out 
of the total 100 for the whole Paso del Norte region, where the maximum tem-
perature was 50.51°C and the minimum, 36.8°C, with an average temperature of 
45.7°C and an increase between 2000 and 2010 of 11°C. In the SST assessment of 
the same 30 points for Las Cruces, New Mexico, the maximum temperature was 
51.6°C and the minimum was 28.3°C, with an average temperature of 39.9°C and 
a difference of 10°C between one year and the next.

The above results show that SST is increasing 

due to changes in the natural state of the soil 

and the effects  of accelerated urban grow-

th. Maps also now show very accurately the 

potential risk zones due to the SST increase, 

which affects not only the comfort levels in 

buildings, but results in increased energy con-

sumption and higher risks to human health 

during heat waves.

 From a resilience perspective, it is important for 
Juarez to have “heat wave” prevention programs 
and strategic tree planting programs that mitiga-
te the heat islands.

“Sustainable design 
and resilience are not 
a trend, or a method, 
or a project...they are a 
philosophy of life”

Tri-national conference on 
Health and Heat: Prevention, 
Mitigation and Resilience in 
the Paso del Norte region

An event conducted in 

collaboration with Juarez City 

Hall, the Border Environmental 

Education Group 2020, the Texas 

Commission on Environmental 

Quality, Technology Hub, 

Ciudad Juarez Autonomous 

University, University of Texas 

at El Paso and the Research and 

Planning Municipal Institute.

The goal of the 

conference, which 

featured speakers from 

Mexico, the U.S. and 

Canada, was to present 

both a local and regional 

perspective on the 

challenges that result 

from heat waves, what 

has been done, and the 

opportunities to reduce 

energy losses and deaths 

in the region.

About 100 people 

attended the event 

on May 24, 2017, and 

it was also broadcast 

simultaneously for 

5 hours in El Paso, 

Texas, and Las Cruces, 

New Mexico. (9:00 am 

to 1:00 pm).

The event analyzed 

the regional climate, 

identifying challenges 

and strategies that 

could lead to health risk 

prevention, mitigation 

and resilience in the face 

of extreme heat in the 

Paso del Norte region.

Description:

With the “Urban Orchards” project, the Resilience Office intends to promote an 

environmental culture by educating citizens on the importance of food produc-

tion, rainfall water conservation, and organic waste management. Urban agricul-

ture can transform bare desert spaces into green, agricultural areas producing 

edible organic products and providing some families with food and an additional 

source of income. Urban agriculture can also reduce heat islands. The project 

will be developed in four phases, and the Resilience Office will:

1. 

Identify edible species suitable for planting in this region (second half 

of 2018).

2.  Prepare orchard prototypes (vertical, horizontal and diagonal) and irrigation 

(drip, spray, rainfall water harvesting) (second half of 2018).

3. 

Implement a pilot project that includes resilient parks, schools and public 

buildings (second half of 2018).

4.  Create local guidelines for establishing and maintaining an orchard (year 2019). 

To execute this project, the Resilience Office must bring in subject matter experts 

from academic institutions and civil associations. In addition, to assist the Resi-

lience Office with the pilot project, the Federal Government’s Ministry of Agrarian, 

Territorial and City Development (SEDATU) has methodologies and guidelines.

Urban 
Orchards

The urban agriculture project of the Centro de 
Asesoría y Promoción Juvenil A. C. (CASA) has 
been promoting environmental education since 
2015 by providing workshops on design and gar-
den maintenance, permaculture, home-made bio-
filters, and the social economy. The project also 
offers workshops on the design and construction 
of an urban orchard; organic waste management;  

soil  enrichment;  planting,  transplanting,  and 
harvesting of different vegetables (e.g., chard, 
cilantro,  horseradish,  squash);  biofertilizers; 
integrated  pest  management;  and  low-tech 
greenhouses. In addition, the project contribu-
tes to the recovery of public spaces by partici-
pating in the reforestation of parks and planting 
of empty lots.

450 families have 
been directly be-
nefited and now 
have organic or-
chards protected 
by shade houses 
and micro-tunnels 

at their homes.

have been distributed to 

the community

In 2017 143 workshops took 
place in various districts with 
groups in the most vulnerable 
areas, as well as with students 

in grade schools, secondary 

schools, and universities.

When the project began, foreign foundations, 
such as Misereor and Paso del Norte Health 
Foundation, made donations for the purchase 
of organic seeds, topsoil, and fertilizer from 
worm castings. 

Technical assistance is given to 
a family until their orchard is 
self-sustaining and providing 
them a stable benefit because 
they are able to sell what they 
grow or save money by growing 
their own supply of healthy food.  

Thanks to the links with high schools, 
the achievements above were pos-
sible because other groups replica-
ted the workshops in the community 
for faculty and students. For exam-
ple, in its urban orchard, TeleBachille-
rato Victor Hugo Rascon Banda gave 
25 workshops and 3 training cour-
ses on creating orchards in schools.  

Centro de Bachillerato Tecnológi-
co Agustín Pro has been part of 
the distribution of vegetables and 
fruits in some districts in the nor-
thwest section of Ciudad Juarez.

Strategic Action: 
Paso del Norte Region Green 
Infrastructure Project: Workshop 
and Guides
In 2018, the North American Development Bank granted funds to the Technical 

Direction and Resilience Office of Juarez to implement a pilot project 

demonstrating the effectiveness of green infrastructure at a local level.

The extreme weather in the Paso 
del Norte region causes intense 
heat waves in the summer and 
freezing  temperatures  in  the 
winter.  These  extremes  result 
in storms and excessive rainfa-
ll. In 2006, the weather resul-
ted in outbreaks of disease and 
four deaths as well as an estima-
ted US$15 million in damages to 
private property and city infras-
tructure, including the city’s pi-
pes, sewage system, and streets. 
The inadequate rainfall sewage 
system, the lack of water-resis-
tant areas in the streets and pu-
blic spaces to keep water from 
filtering into the subsoil,  
and the floods that often occur 

in  low  areas  impair  the  city’s 
ability to function. To mitiga-
te  the  impacts  of  floods,  GI, 
which is a multifunctional type 
of infrastructure that uses na-
tural systems to improve envi-
ronmental quality and provide 
social, economic, cultural and 
benefits. can be used. 
Strategic stakeholders will be 
invited  to  a  GI  workshop  for 
training and to exchange best 
practices. The city will design 
a GI pilot project and will  con-
tribute an appendix on GI for the 
Paso del Norte region to the Nor-
th American Development Bank’s 
(BDAN) Green Infrastructure De-
sign Guidelines Handbook for 

Mexican Border Municipalities.
The overarching goal is to build 
a binational understanding of 
urban runoff management, ra-
infall water catchment systems, 
and the creation of sustainable 
green spaces as strategies to 
increase the region’s resilience.
El objetivo general es fortale-
cer una cultura binacional so-
bre la importancia del manejo 
de las escorrentías urbanas, la 
captura de agua de lluvia y la 
creación  de  espacios  verdes 
sustentables como estrategias 
para incrementar la resiliencia 
de la región.  
The project will begin in April of 
2018 and will last about 6 months.

Once it is published, the Juarez Resilience Strategy is ex-
pected to become the cornerstone of long-term planning. 
To achieve successful, effective results, the principle of re-
silience will be the lens through which projects are selec-
ted, resources identified, and scopes of work defined. The 
initiative will assign priority to actions that have a greater 
scope, and every action must have a project manager who 
is responsible for its implementation. The Strategy will be 
the umbrella for a portfolio of projects, in which any one  
action may relate to other projects.

 
The Strategy was built on learnings as, notwithstanding 
the social crisis in which Juarez society has been invol-
ved, many people invested time, knowledge and expe-
rience in the construction of a shared view to build a 
stronger resilience in the city. Therefore, inter and multi 
sector networks must be stronger and more robust, so 
that every project takes off from a solid base of stake-
holders which, in turn, monitor progress. In the view of 
resilience, involvement and commitment of citizens en-
sure that projects have a greater repercussion and re-
sonance, in addition to continuity.

Collaboration must occur throughout the various levels 
of government. The Chief Resilience Officer will have a 
central role and work with the city mayor. Local and state 
government institutions have two missions: 1) to include 
resilience principles in their decision-making processes; 
and 2) to serve as the leads for some of the actions des-
cribed in this document as well as to collaborate on other 
actions. To enhance communication among the interes-
ted parties, a matrix identifying the various projects to 
be developed and stakeholder interest in participating in 
them will be prepared.

A monitoring system is a key element of the Strate-
gy, and periodic assessments will gauge the progress 
made on its implementation. Every action has indica-
tors for measuring the progress achieved. The perio-
dic assessments will identify gaps and opportunities 
for exploring new solutions. The monitoring system 
will also help determine how effective the various ini-
tiatives are in building resilience in Juarez.

For a successful implementation of the Resilience Strategy, the Resilience 
Office must be firmly established. In addition to building resilience in Juarez, 
it will lead the resilience movement along Mexico’s northern border. Other 
agencies must be engaged to help monitor the actions, consolidate metho-
dologies, and find funding sources to support the execution of projects that 
result from the actions.

Prepare projects per action. There are five project management processes, which 
have clear dependencies and are executed in the same sequence. The subcom-
ponents of one process may interact with the components of the other four pro-
cesses. The five  processes are:

Begins the official implementation of a pro-
duct, service or outcome.

 Defines the objectives and intended scope of 
the project, and documents the required cour-
se of action to achieve the objectives.

 Includes the people and resources to execute 
the plan or manage the project.

 Measures progress regularly to identify gaps 
in the project management plan so that co-
rrective measures may be taken to meet pro-
ject objectives.

 Signifies that the phase has ended, based 
on official acceptance of the product, servi-
ce or outcome.

Acequia (Ditch): Irrigation method used in Juarez to irrigate 
cultivated land.

City council: Representative body of the community charged 
with the smooth functioning of the municipality. The city coun-
cil consists of the mayor and the councillors.

Food basket: A value set on an amount of food that is the mi-
nimum standard for health and well-being and that is deter-
mined based on the nutritional requirements of a population 
rather than an individual (CONEVAL).

Sustainable  development:  The  type  of  development  that 
meets today’s needs without imposing risks on the capacity 
of future generations to satisfy their needs.

Circular economy: An economy that is restorative or rege-

nerative by intent and by design. It replaces the concept of 
“expiration” with the idea of “restoration” and moves towards 
the use of renewable energy sources, reduces the use of to-
xic chemicals that prevent reuse and return to the biosphere, 
and aims instead to redefine products and services to elimi-
nate waste while minimizing negative impacts. 

(Ellen MacArthur Foundation).

Solidarity economy: An approach to economic activity that 
takes the well-being and quality of life of people into account, 
that respects the environment, and that prioritizes sustaina-
ble development above all other interests.

Empowerment: In political or socioeconomic terms, “to grant 
power [to a socioeconomically disadvantaged group] so that 
they can improve their lives through self-determination.” (RAE).

172

Appendix173Resilient Juarez172Resilient JuarezFemicides: The intentional killing of women or girls because 
of their gender, constituting the most extreme form of violen-
ce against women and classified as such in the Mexican crimi-
nal system.

Incubator company: A project, company or center that creates 
and develops small companies or micro businesses, and provi-
des support to such companies during their early stages (Ins-
tituto Mexiquense del Emprendedor).

Export maquiladora industry: Any partial product manufactu-
ring, assembly, or packaging by a company that is not the ori-
ginal manufacturer. In Ciudad Juarez, the export maquiladora 
industry emerged in the mid-1960s as an economic response 
to labor shortages in developed countries.

U.S. and Mexico in 1942. The name refers to Mexican workers, 
mostly farmer laborers, who were allowed temporary entry 
into the U.S to make up for labor shortages in the U.S. during 
and after World War II. According to the Bracero History Ar-
chive, an estimated 4.6 million Mexicans came to work in the 
U.S. as braceros between 1942 and 1964, the year in which 
the program ended. 

Urban Density Increase: A positive or negative change in the 
population density in an urban area.

Urban revitalization: Reversing the effects of the physical, so-
cial and economic deterioration of a downtown area and other 
important parts of a city, and creating the urban conditions 
that traditional downtown areas need to be sustainable (Ta-
racena, 2013).

Well-being line: Monetary value of a box of food, goods and 
basic utilities (CONEVAL).

Septentrion: North.

Economically active population: All those of working age with 
the capacity and availability to contribute to the production of 
economic goods and services at a particular moment in time. 
Included are people who work or have a job (employed) and 
those who do not have a job but are willing to work (unemplo-
yed). Conversely, an economically inactive population includes 
those who are not available to work because of age, disability, 
or personal choice (INEGI).

Porfiriato: Period in Mexican history when Porfirio Díaz (1830-
1915) was the country’s president.

Presidio: City or fortress that could be used as shelter by sol-
diers serving in the defense of Northern Mexico.

Empty lot: Private, unused land that is subdivided into plots 
classified as “urban” according to current law, within agglome-
ration perimeter and that can be used for residential, industrial, 
commercial, and service purposes. It also refers to taxable land 
that is no longer classified according to its prior use (Cliche-
vsky, 2007).

Tactical urbanism: Umbrella term for a collection of alter-
natives for the collaborative, user-generated design, cons-
truction, and management of urban spaces, based on the 
needs, dreams, and ideas of citizens. These alternative pro-
jects meet short-term needs and generally bypass the usual 
government requirements and lengthy processes (Hernan-
dez, 2015).

Bracero Program: The Mexican Agricultural Workers Pro-
gram, better known as the Bracero Program, signed by the 

Vulnerable due to income:  A population that is vulnerable ba-
sed on incomes that are at or below the poverty line.
