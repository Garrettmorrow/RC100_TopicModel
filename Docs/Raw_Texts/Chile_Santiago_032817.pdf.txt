Claudio Orrego Larraín
Santiago Metropolitan Area Governor

There are several challenges that the Metropolitan Region needs to address in order 
to meet the expectations of its citizens. Although the majority of its inhabitants believe 
that the region is progressing and holds many benefits in teSMR of accessibility to 
services, work opportunities and connectivity, they also willingly admit the existence 
of problems that significantly affect their daily lives. These problems can be traced 
in areas such as security, transport and pollution, where social inequality is a factor 
that transcends all of these stresses.
 
Likewise, phenomena such as climate change and greater citizen empowerment make 
it increasingly complex for the city to face critical, social and nature-related events, 
illustrating the need to generate prevention and mitigation plans.
 
Whilst these urban problems are shared with most of the world’s major metropolises, 
Santiago still has a long way to go before it can become a global city, with proper 
governance and an improved quality of life for its inhabitants.
 
This Resilience Strategy is the first step in addressing these challenges, as it 
transfoSMR the dreams and aspirations of the city into concrete, implementable 
actions that may truly impact people’s lives.
 
This comes at a period of transition in the country. The constitutional reform that 
created governors-elect in regions (including Santiago), and that established the 
metropolitan areas, has only recently been approved. Although all of its powers, 
financing and the election date of these governors are yet to be established, this will 
happen sooner or later, and moving from the current marked centralism towards an 
effective decentralization stage, is undoubtedly necessary.
 
By developing this strategy, progress has been made for Santiago to become a fairer, 
more humane and inclusive city, providing all of its inhabitants with the opportunity 
to live and enjoy the city’s benefits under the same conditions. We want to build a 
human scale city, where development is focused on the people. We want to improve 
the city’s ability to face the stresses and shocks that threaten it, and implement 
actions that allow us to become a Human and Resilient Santiago.
 
This resilience strategy has been prepared with the citizens’ needs at the forefront 
of its mind, in a participatory public-private agenda, which has managed to generate 
a comprehensive plan for the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. It includes actions 
that are consistent with the expectations of institutions: the capacity to strongly lead 
the changes that are required to achieve the desired standard of living in the city, five 
hundred years after the foundation of Santiago, in 2041.

 We must improve collaborative work with the different stakeholders of society. The 
Rockefeller Foundation’s 100RC network has been an essential support system and, 
together with the Strategy-making process, it has allowed for articulating public 
stakeholders, companies, academics and social organizations, whose specialized 
counseling have made it possible for all knowledge in this document to be at the 
city’s service.
 
Metropolitan governance can provide a major contribution to developing a Resilient 
Santiago. Strengthening regional and local decision-making powers, as well as a 
territorial development approach, can improve resource allocation efficiency, policy-
making and implementation quality, as well as the legitimacy of collective decision-
making, bringing itself closer to inhabitants.

But above all, resilience requires an adequate leadership that recognizes the 
interdependence between organizations and network interactions that run through 
the city, where dialogue, negotiation, trust building and the construction of shared 
agreements and horizons must meet.
 
At present, the relative lag of Santiago’s regional level makes it difficult to act on 
those areas where coordination and institutional fragmentation problems must be 
faced, to maximize the advantages related to agglomeration economies that occur 
in cities, to identify groups or areas with lags, and the capacity to generate specific 
public policies of the territorial reality.
 
In this sense, regional governance appears as an emerging challenge in a country with 
a centralist tradition, and whose decentralization process has been mainly focused 
on strengthening municipal governments, over the regional and metropolitan scale. 
Hence why this strategy is aimed at putting an end to institutional fragmentation, 
where municipalities act as 34 islands and where an autarkic operation from ministries 
and services is imposed.
 
The Resilience Strategy for the Metropolitan Region acts as a commitment to a 
sustainable, fair and resilient city; one that is also able to face future challenges in 
an effective manner.

Michael Berkowitz
100 Resilient Cities President

100 Resilient Cities is honored to partner with Santiago, Chile, in supporting this 
important work and celebrating the presentation of this resilience strategy arising 
from the city’s multiple shocks and stresses, as well as from the increasing need for 
better integrated regional planning and metropolitan coordination.
 
The political commitment and leadership of Intendant Orrego were crucial in developing 
this Strategy. The Resilience Office focused its efforts on ensuring that the city’s 
different planning instruments were taken into account during the process to examine 
each of the issues. Local stakeholders’ knowledge and experience was certainly 
a distinctive element of this strategy’s development, including the participation of 
academics, public and private sectors, as well as civil society.
 
The Intendance is currently making progress in order to institutionalize the Resilience 
Office and to ensure that it is an organic part of the Regional Government, which 
will allow for achieving synergies with other areas of the institution that are being 
addressed by the new urban agenda, aimed at Santiago’s sustainable development.
 
I would like to thank Claudio Orrego, since this would not have been possible without 
his leadership and support. I would also like to thank the City’s Resilience Director, 
Gabriela Elgueta, her assistant, Cristián Robertson, and her whole team, who laid the 
groundwork for this forward-thinking Resiliency Strategy, and who were able to bring 
together and include the contributions of several stakeholders on resilience reflections.
 
The Resilience Strategy of Santiago, Chile, identifies six pillars and interrelated goals 
that guide citizen initiatives, which will thus make it possible to achieve a stronger, 
more resilient city. The strategy includes initiatives that identify and put forth a better 
metropolitan coordination for the integration of mobility options, including integrated 
public space and increased infrastructure for bicycles.
 
Santiago, Chile, has reached a historical moment in the redefinition of its regional 
government. This strategy outlines a set of opportunities that can further help define 
it. We are delighted to continue our work in Santiago, Chile, and we look forward to 
implementing the initiatives of this strategy with the support of an important and 
diverse set of stakeholders from municipal and regional agencies, local universities 
and organizations, to the 100RC Platform Partners who have all come together to 
help create this strategy.

The current political, social and environmental conditions call for Santiago to face 
and resolve the effects of acute shocks and chronic stresses that tend to arise as a 
fact of present and future reality in a more organic manner.

The Resilience Strategy opens a new space for reflection and action, which integrates 
different points of view and possible solutions to the structural problems of the 
region, aimed at laying the foundations of a participatory city plan. A city that must 
be thought of in an integrated manner, where people should feel as though they live 
in a cohesive city; one that is able to respond readily to conflicts and be prepared for 
potential crises.

The Metropolitan Region of Santiago (SMR) must learn from the past but, above all, 
admit its vulnerabilities, by establishing a public-private collaborative work model for 
the future. Implementation should especially focus on strengthening the local and 
community capacity to address problems in a timely manner. Resilient Santiago must 
have a continuous learning process, whereby innovation is essential in effectively and 
efficiently responding to the changes that will affect the city.
 
In order to achieve economic, social and cultural development in the SMR, fulfilling 
the goals proposed in the Strategy is essential. Although these actions are expected 
to materialize in 2041, they have been structured in short, medium and long-term 
periods, aimed at making determined and steady progress. We fully believe that these 
actions are integral to overcoming development barriers that can arise from the lack 
of planning in the Metropolitan Region, due to the existence of weak subnational 
institutions.

The strategy-making process has made apparent the need to provide common 
institutionalism to the challenges of the urban agenda, since they can no longer 
be classed as surfacing themes of the city: the effects of Climate change, urban 
sustainability, smart cities and resilience. Whilst there are multiple individual efforts 
by organizations being made to combat these issues, they do tend to address the 
same areas, simply duplicating actions.

A combined workforce must be put into action and this must be made to last. This 
has certainly been the best asset of the strategy-making process, which, far from 
being completed, is only just beginning. There are many stakeholders to be added in 
the future, generating new relationships and spaces for dialogue around the needs 
of an ever-changing city.
 
Santiago has all of the talents required to move forward on the resilience agenda. 
To this end, it also requires a system of governance that validates and encourages 
collaborative instances allowing it to face hazards and stresses in a harmonious and 
comprehensive manner

Santiago is at a turning point in which it could reverse its shortcomings and capitalize 
on its advantages if appropriate measures are taken today. In recent years, the region 
and its inhabitants have demonstrated the capacity to recover from the most diverse 
impacts, from the mega-earthquake of 2010 to the overflow of the Mapocho River in 
2016, recovering its operational capacity in a few hours. Likewise, Santiago has been 
able to cope, continue to grow and develop despite coexisting with chronic tensions 
such as inequality, air pollution and mobility problems. .

On the other hand, the governance structure of the city at the regional level is faced with 
a strong territorial fragmentation and institutional overlap that generates duplicities, 
lack of coordination, inability to integrate policies in the territory and the impossibility 
of generating comprehensive urban projects with a long-term look. The emphasis 
of this strategy is placed on governance, since it can contribute decisively to solving 
structural issues.

It is a priority to have a strategy that manages to generate the guidelines to face the 
problems of the city through a planning process that includes the different stakeholders 
of society with a vision of the future for the Region.

In this context, the network of 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), pioneered by the Rockefeller 
Foundation, selected the Santiago Metropolitan Region in 2014 to be part of the 
group of 100 cities in the world that work in the construction of resilience for face 
the physical, social and economic challenges of the 21st century.

The Santiago Human and Resilient Strategy generates a chart of navigation towards 
2041, which seeks to strengthen the coordination capacity and promote an institutional 
framework that is capable of articulating all the stakeholders and communities, in 
order to learn from the lessons of the past, to know the risks and their roots, reduce 
and mitigate their eventual damages and strengthen the recovery capacity to build 
the Santiago of the future.

VISION

We aim for Santiago to have a human scale driven development, in which 
neither the car, nor the building, nor the economic interest predominates, 
but people. A city where its inhabitants know Santiago is dreamt, is 
planned and is built thinking of each one of them.

Santiago´s Resilience Strategy is divided into 6 pillars: Mobility, Environment, 
Security, Risk Management, Economic Development and Competitiveness, 
and Social Equity; subdivided into 21 objectives in order to address the 
challenges of the city through a more human and resilient vision. The objectives 
are achieved through 75 proposed plans, programs and projects organized 
according to their temporality (short, medium and long term).

Throughout each pillar, a couple of priority plans, projects or programs where 
identified and recognized, due to their specific condition, as emblematic projects that 
Santiago Resiliente will promote for its future implementation

1.1. 100 RESILIENT CITIES INITIATIVE

The  program  consists  of  three  main 
phases: 

Phase 1. Identifying the city’s priority 
issues.  The  foundations  for  the 
development of the resilience strategy 
were established through instances of 
participation  and  the  involvement  of 
several key stakeholders. This phase 
culminated  in  the  preparation  of  the 
Preliminary  Resilience  Assessment 
(PRA).

Phase 2. In-depth thematic process. 
New analyses were conducted during 
this phase, and the discussion of the 
prioritized topics was deepened. Gaps 
were identified and partnerships were 
formed. This phase ended with the launch 
of the city’s Resilience Strategy.

Phase  3.  Strategy  implementation 
Development of the initiatives identified 
in the Resilience Strategy.

The 100 Resilient Cities network -100RC- 
is a program promoted by the Rockefeller 
Foundation, aimed at helping global cities 
become more resilient to the physical, 
social  and  economic  challenges  of 
the 21st century. 100RC supports the 
adoption and incorporation of a resilience 
approach that not only includes shocks, 
such as earthquakes, fires, floods, etc., 
but also stresses that may weaken a 
city’s structure on a daily or cyclical basis. 

The program supports the cities included 
in its network through financial support 
to retain a CRO1, who will lead the city’s 
resilience initiatives, as well as through 
expert support for the development of a 
resilience strategy, access to services 
provided by global strategic partners and 
by becoming part of a global network 
of cities to share experiences and best 
urban practices. Through these actions, 
100RC is not only aimed at helping these 
cities become more resilient individually, 
but also at building a global practice of 
resilience between governments, NGOs, 
the private sector and citizens.

1.2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR URBAN RESILIENCE

Although the term ‘resilience’ emerged in 
the 1970’s; related to the field of ecology, 
describing  the  ability  of  systems  to 
maintain or recover their functionality 
in the event of disruptions, in recent 
years, the term has also been used in 
connection with cities, since they are 
complex systems, constantly adapting 
to  changing  situations2.  The  term 
resilience has been defined by the 100 
Resilient Cities program as “the capacity 
of individuals, communities, companies 

and systems within a city to survive, 
adapt and grow, no matter what kinds 
of chronic stresses and acute shocks 
they  experience.”3.  Urban  resilience 
focuses on the ability of systems to better 
prepare, adapt and recover when faced 
with multiple threats, in a prompt and 
efficient manner. 

According to the program’s definition 
of  Resilience,  resilient  systems  are 
characterized by 7 qualities4:

1.  Reflective:  They  use  past 
experience to gather information and 
to come to future decisions.

2.  Robust:  Well-built,  conceived 
and managed systems integrating 
quantitative  and  qualitative 
approaches.

3.  Inclusive:  Prioritize  citizen 
participation, 
integrating  the 
opinions and aspirations of society’s 
representative  stakeholders  in 
decision-making.
 
4. Integrated: Processes that are 
capable of bringing a wide range of 
different systems and institutions 
together through articulated work.

5.  Resourceful: They recognize 
alternative ways of using resources 
in times of crisis, in order to meet their 
needs or achieve their goals.

6. Redundant: They must include 
initiatives and policies that guarantee 
the  ability  to  reactivate  the  city’s 
operating systems in times of failure 
or collapse. 

7.  Flexible: Systems capable of 
adapting  to  unforeseen  changes 
arising  within  the  context:  risk 
situations, critical situations, lack of 
data or the inclusion of new interested 
parties.

2.1. CONTEXT

The city of Santiago is the heart of the 
Metropolitan Region of Santiago (SMR), 
which although is the smallest region of 
the country, it is also the most densely 
populated  one7.  It  currently  has  over 
6.1 million inhabitants, and by 2020, its 
population is expected to exceed 7.5 million, 
which would count for over 40% of the 
country’s total population8. In this context, 
Chile’s population growth-rates indicate 
that Santiago’s population will stabilize at 
around 8 million, below mega cities such as 
Sao Paulo or Mexico, which already exceed 
15 million inhabitants. 

Although  Santiago’s  population  is  not 
expected to grow significantly, its income 
will indeed increase and as a by-product 
of this, so would the demands for a better 
quality of life, larger housing and better 
services and as a result, the city will continue 
to  grow  in  size  and  height.  The  Gross 
Domestic Product of the SMR exceeds 93 
billion dollars9, and is expected to double 
by  2025,  placing  Santiago  among  the 
world’s 75 most dynamic cities. Projected 
economic and social growth implies that, 
by the end of this decade, middle-upper-
class households (ABC1 C2) will increase 
their current share from 33% to 46% of 
the population. The Metropolitan Region 
is mostly urban: 96.9% of the population 
lives in urban areas, the percentage of 
rurality has remained stable since 1990 and 
the projections of the National Statistics 
Institute for year 2020 remain around 3 %11.

The Region’s most important activity comes 
under Financial and Business Services 
(36%), followed by Commerce, Restaurants 
and Hotels (16%), which count for half of 
the region’s economic activity12. Santiago 
is Latin America’s safest capital city, with 

the lowest homicide rates, low levels of 
corruption and a stable institution, creating 
the proper development dynamics for it to 
become one of the region’s main business 
and services centers, thus capitalizing on 
its positive attributes. This is recognized in 
several international rankings that position 
the Chilean capital among the continent’s 
3 best cities to live in and do business.13  

Administratively speaking, the Metropolitan 
Region is led by the Regional Government, 
which  is  headed  by  the  Intendant  and 
the  Regional  Council.  Its  territory  is 
organized  into  six  provinces  that 
group 52 autonomous districts with 
democratically elected authorities. 34 
of these districts correspond to the 
Metropolitan Area of Santiago, and 
18 of them to the rural environment. 
Unlike the world’s major cities, Santiago still 
lacks a democratically elected metropolitan 
authority.  Nor  does  it  have  technical 
metropolitan authorities in place to control 
planning,  transport  or  security  powers 
that are distributed at a local or national 
level, which renders the coordination and 
implementation of metropolitan policies 
and programs difficult.

Chile’s central zone has a semiarid climate, 
with four well-defined seasons and rainfall 
concentrated in the winter. Water fallen in 
the high mountains during cold months 
is stored in the snow and the ice of the 
mountain, feeding the rivers during the 
rest of the year and generating suitable 
conditions for life and cultivation. This 
geographical configuretion, coupled with its 
agricultural potential, allows for the region to 
be defined as a mixed region. According to 
the statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture, 
the SMR rural sector has an area of about

150,000 hectares of intensive production in 
the country’s best lands. The SMR is Chile’s 
main producer of vegetables (27%) and the 
third-ranking producer of fruit trees14.

Whilst  poverty  rates  have  declined 
since  199015,  the  explosive  economic 
development experienced in recent years 
has led to disturbingly increased rates of 
inequality, cementing the Region’s place as 
that with the highest levels of inequality in 
the country16. In turn, Santiago is the capital 
of OECD countries with greater distributive 
inequality of economic growth benefits and 
greater segregation of rich groups, which 
are concentrated in the most provided for 
part of the city17. The income gap between 
the richest and poorest quintiles amounts 
to 15 times, leading to differences in access 
to, quality and location of housing, access 

to quality education, gender gaps, disparity 
of services between central and peripheral 
districts18, amongst other problems. 
Although the Chilean State has developed 
several policies, programs and structural 
refoSMR to reverse these problems, their 
territorial  implementation  still  remains 
uncertain while the governance of cities 
and metropolitan areas is unresolved. In 
recent years, there have been emerging 
processes that have been providing the 
Metropolitan Region with new features. 
Santiago’s population is gradually aging, 
and migratory processes from several Latin 
American countries have grown steadily. 
Additionally,  there  is  a  growing  stress 
between levels of achievement and levels 
of individual well-being, partly related to 
the diminished trust in politics and public 
institutions.19

FRAGMENTED) 

Figure 5. Santiago´s urban growth

Over  the  last  decades,  Chile  has 
undergone an explosive development 
process,  cementing  it  as  a  Latin 
American benchmark. Both the country 
and the Metropolitan Region have been 
characterized  by  a  steady  economic 
growth,  financial  robustness20  and  a 
significant  reduction  in  the  levels  of 
poverty.  However,  the  built  city  has 
consolidated with a scenario of limited 
urban planning tools, along with a high 
preponderance of market dynamics.21

Santiago has mainly grown in size, mostly 
as a result of the sustained construction 
of large sets of social and middle-class 
housing in cheap lands located in the 
northwest, southwest and southeast 
suburbs. Although this has generated a 
solution to the quantitative housing deficit, 
it has also consolidated large pockets 
of poverty with little to no coverage of 
urban public property. In contrast, the 
expansion towards the northeast suburbs 
has predominantly occurred through the 
construction  of  low-density  suburbs 
and closed condominiums, generating 
a whole new dimension of segregation, 
territorial fragmentation and dynamics 
of public space use22. 

land  and  housing  policies 
The 
implemented  over  the  last  30  years 
have  made  a  direct  impact  on  the 
living  conditions  of  neighborhoods 
and communities. In the 1980s, slum 
(campamentos) eradication programs 
that  had  been  developed  during  the 
dictatorship inferred a heavy transfer 
of low-income population from central 
areas towards the suburbs. Whilst these 
programs provided permanent housing 
solutions for families that had previously 
lived in those slums, the quality of the new

equipment, among other issues.26

In accordance with the aforementioned 
trends, the administrative and financial 
center of Santiago has gradually moved 
from the historic center towards the 
east, following the geographic wedge of 
wealth concentration. This high-income 
area possesses metropolitan services 
and  sources  of  employment,  which 
means that only three districts (Santiago, 
Providencia and Las Condes) attract 40% 
of morning rush hour journeys.27 On the 
other hand, the construction of urban 
sub-centers has materialized through 
large malls that have not generated a 
significant  dispersion  of  the  region’s 
sources of employment28, nor a public 
open space capable of generating local 
urban identity.  

Faced  with  this  political,  economic, 
spatial and social reality, Santiago has 
implemented its Regional Development 
Strategy, which, in line with this “Resilience 
Strategy: Human and Resilient Santiago”, 
will allow facing current challenges and 
opportunities:  building  a  fairer,  more 
sustainable and resilient city, one that 
regards individuals as the heart of its 
work and one that is planned and built 
in a participatory and equitable manner.

new housing was poor, since they were 
situated on remote, cheap lands that were 
far from networking opportunities and 
that lacked essential equipment.23

Once democracy was recovered in the 
1990s, these incentives to expel low-
income classes to the suburbs were 
strengthened by regulations that reduced 
the provision of urban land, which not 
only incited speculation and a limited 
access  to  social  housing  lands,  but 
also confirmed a spatial segregation 
model. These dynamics exceeded the 
capacity of existing planning instruments 
and of the authorities to regulate the 
supply of equipment to meet all needs 
related  to  service,  leisure,  education 
and socialization. As for new middle-
class neighborhoods, the design and 
equipment standards of green areas met 
the minimum requirements, maximizing 
land use. However, in the case of social 
housing, the level of consolidation of 
public spaces, lighting and services are, 
even to this day, highly precarious. This 
is partly due to the fact that these sets 
overburden municipal services, which do 
not earn sufficient income to cover the 
demands, since social housing is exempt 
from the payment of real estate taxes.

Over time, Santiago has become a large, 
dispersed and socially fragmented city, 
whose territory reflects the country’s 
high levels of inequality. The highest 
income groups24 are dispersed between 
6 districts that represent only 18% of the 
urban area.25 The quality of life in this 
part of the city excels in international 
rankings, placing Santiago as one of Latin 
America’s best cities to live in. However, 
most of Santiago’s inhabitants endure 
a  polar-opposite  reality:  They  live  in 
spatially segregated areas with serious 
habitability and urban health problems, 
having little access to quality services 
and infrastructure, experiencing problems 
with  connectivity  and  encountering

2.3. SHOCKS AND STRESSES IN SCL 

A resilient city is both well prepared to 
deal with sudden shocks that threaten 
it, as well as to address chronic stresses 
that weaken its systems on a daily or 
cyclical basis. Considering the physical, 
natural and social context of the SMR, 
understanding the hazards, threats and 
vulnerabilities to which it is exposed is 

necessary. Through a bibliographical 
review, supplemented with participatory 
processes that included a wide range 
of stakeholders29, the main shocks and 
stresses  that  threaten  the  city  were 
identified, particularly those addressed 
by this Resilience Strategy.

Appendix - Development of the Strategy.

2.3.1. S hocks

Historically, the SMR has faced several 
shocks  related  to  its  geography  and 
climate (earthquakes, barrages, stoSMR, 
floods, thermal inversion and droughts). 
These shocks have affected the region’s 
urban  and  rural  realities,  whilst  also 
putting at risk physical property and basic 
subsistence systems. The city has had to 
recover and rebuild itself systematically 
and, whilst doing so, has been forced to 
develop new parameters aimed at dealing 
with parts of these phenomena. 

However, an increase in extreme weather 
incidents due to climate change in recent 
years, coupled with new information on 
existing threats in the region and the 
persistence of vulnerabilities contributing 
to risk, all indicate that planning and 
preparing  for  possible  threats  is  an 
urgent task. According to historical and 
projected evidence, the most potentially 
disruptive shocks on the SMR are: 1) 
Geophysical phenomena such as deep 
(plate subduction) or cortical (presence 
of the San Ramón fault) earthquakes 
and volcanic eruptions; 2) Extreme 
climatic phenomena such as pluvial-

fluvial flooding and drought cycles 
affecting most of the SMR; 3) Landslides 
arising from hydro-meteorological events 
in urban areas built on risk areas and 4) 
Wildfires in rural areas of the SMR.

Like  most  of  the  country,  the  SMR 
is  located  in  the  Andean  subduction 
margin,  which  explains  its  constant 
seismic  activity  (between  1906  and 
2010,  there  were  seven  destructive 
seismic  incidents  in  the  SMR)  .  In 
recent years, dangers related to seismic 
activity in areas near the fault of San 
Ramón, located in the eastern part of 
Santiago, on the piedmont of the Andes, 
have been scientifically proven. This is 
a seismically active geological fault31, 
where movements of about one and four 
meters could occur in the event that an 
earthquake hit between 6.6 and 7.432. 
An earthquake of these characteristics, 
coupled with constructions built with 
seismic standards that are unsuitable for 
incidents of this scale, could be extremely 
destructive for the region33. 

30. (PRS, CITRID, 2016). The country’s 
annual  losses  due  to  earthquakes 
account for about 1 and 2% of the GDP; 
whereas the 27F 2010 earthquake and 
tsunami entailed losses of about US$ 
30,000  million  for  the  government, 
equivalent to 18% of the national GDP. 
This confiSMR the need to continuously 
manage  the  risks  related  to  these 
incidents, in order to reduce potential 
destructive impacts

Although the region’s volcanic activity 
was intense during the 20th century, 
it has declined over the last decades. 
Episodes of eruption have been small, 
very  localized  and  adjacent  to  the 
high Andean mountain range, beyond 
populated areas. However, volcanic risk 
and potential lahars are a latent threat, 
especially for cities located in particularly 
vulnerable areas of the upper valleys of 
the Maipo and Mapocho rivers.

On the other hand, over the last few years, 
the SMR has experienced emergencies 
and disasters caused by barrages and 

rapid  floods  of  rivers  in  the  Andean 
precordillera.  These  extreme  hydro-
meteorological  events  affect  a  great 
part of the region. In recent years, this 
condition has been exacerbated by: 1) 
the accelerated urbanization process 
without proper urban planning, 2) the 
potential increase of so-called “warm 
rains”, with a high isotherm due to climate 
change, and 3) the still scarce network 
of  hydro-meteorological  monitoring, 
and a significant lack of information of 
meteorological and geomorphological 
processes34.

Additionally,  the  city  frequently 
experiences other types of incidents, such 
as pluvial floods, consisting in flooding of 
highly waterproofed low areas with little 
to no drainage system coverage. 

In  this  regard,  the  Andes  mountain 
range has a high risk of mass landslides 
due to hydro-meteorological events or 
seismic phenomena, which pose a threat, 
particularly for infrastructures, but also 
for many isolated areas.

Finally,  wildfires  (which  in  Chile  are 
man-made, since there is no possibility 

of causalities due to electrical stoSMR 
or spontaneous combustion) have been 
a  constant  shock  over  the  past  four 
decades, with an average of 440 fires 
per year and more than 4,250 hectares 
affected35. They have been cyclical, with 
11-year  peaks.  Vegetation  has  been 
destroyed, and valuable ecosystems have 
been directly and indirectly damaged by 
the reduction of the ability for natural 
recovery due to the high frequency of 
such threats.

a. Mobility

There are several stakeholders that have 
negatively affected mobility in Santiago. 
With urban growth that lacks proper 
planning in land use and transport that 
is tailored to its needs, there has been a 
long-drawn-out scenario for the creation 
of an efficient transportation system that 
includes motorized and non-motorized 
means  of  transport.  Ten  years  after 
its implementation, the capital’s main 
public transport system, Transantiago, 
is faced with a number of challenges: 
users’ systematic disapproval (due to 
poor travel experience and overcrowding), 

high  levels  of  evasion38,  insufficient 
infrastructure to ensure proper travel 
and transshipment times; and lastly the 
need for unplanned subsidies obtained 
through special laws39. This situation 
discouraged the use of public transport 
and thus increased private car usage, 
resulting in road congestion. According 
to Origin Destination surveys conducted 
in Santiago, the percentage of motorized 
trips in public transport has fallen from 
83% in 1977 to 70% in 1991, 52% in 2001 
and 47% in 201240.

b. Security

Although Santiago is deemed as Latin 
America’s  safest  city41,  Santiago’s 
inhabitants believe this issue to be their 
biggest  problem,  concerning  mainly 
crime and drugs42. While it is true that 
victimization rates have fallen from 40% 
in 2003 to 26.4% in 201543, the feeling of 
insecurity has increased.

In  the  region,  27.9%  of  the  police 
reports  relate  to  incivilities  in  public 
spaces, which leads to an impairment 
of spaces, dirt, absence of minimum 
agreed standards, abuse and vandalism. 
To  combat  these  types  of  acts,  the 
Chilean system has put two separate 
and  centralized  police  structures  in 
place, but lacks community policing. 
Carabineros, the main police force in the 
country, seems to lack a territorial policy 

that takes into account the diversity of 
the SMR’s social situations44, and local 
governments have severe restrictions 
in creating and implementing municipal 
police capabilities. 

In addition, about 16% of young people 
(about 500,000 individuals) currently 
neither work nor study; many of who have 
dropped out of school and who mostly 
belong to the lowest quintiles45, located 
in segregated suburban areas46, with a 
high social vulnerability. This situation 
generates exclusionary dynamics that 
in some cases lead to anti-systemic 
behavior such as gangs, barras bravas, 
criminal groups and drug trafficking, 
weakening cohesion and increasing the 
social risk of communities. 47

c. Environment

Environmental  stresses  relate  to  air 
pollution, a lack of green areas, poor 
management of solid waste and climate 
effects,  among  other  elements.  Car-
centered urban sprawl, concentration of 
industrial activities and the persistent use 
of firewood in a valley equipped with very 
poor ventilation have contributed to poor 
air quality. In 1996, Santiago was declared 
as an “Area Saturated with Breathable 
Particles PM10, Suspension Particles, 
Ozone and Carbon Monoxide; and Latent 
Zone for Nitrogen Dioxide”, which led to 
the creation of the first Atmospheric 
Decontamination and Prevention Plan 
for the Metropolitan Region (PPDA). In 
2014, Santiago was also declared an Area 
Saturated by Fine Breathable Particles 
(PM2.5), which led to the creation of a 
new Atmospheric Decontamination plan.
As for solid waste management, this has 

become a chronic problem in Santiago, 
and in recent years, it has become one 
of the most pressing issues in the public 
agenda. Although there is a regulation and 
audit, problems linked with garbage have 
been accentuated by the absence of a 
central coordination with comprehensive 
long-term waste management plans, little 
education on domestic and commercial 
recycling and the high concentration of 
illegal landfills and small dump sites in 
suburbs and vulnerable neighborhoods. 
Lastly, the main sanitary landfills are 
located in low-income districts, such 
as Til Til, which are repositories of a 
number of undesirable land uses prisons, 
hazardous industries and other activities 
that transform the areas into real dead 
zones, yet another growing aspect of 
urban segregation in the region.

2.4. CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate  change  effects  pose  an 
enormous challenge, concerning both 
their understanding and planning of a 
region adapting to them. In the case of 
the SMR, these changes could affect both 
urban (heat waves, changes in water 
and energy availability, occurrence of 
extreme events48) and rural areas, with 
droughts that accentuate agricultural 
water demand. 

Increased temperature may significantly 
affect  the  occurrence  of  floods  and 
barrages,  given  the  proximity  of  the 
city’s urban area to the Andes Mountains, 
tending to raise the 0 ° C isotherm. This 
implies  an  increase  in  the  rainwater 
flow to the basin.49 Another effect is an 
increased rate of heat stoSMR, which 
could  generate  high  sedimentation 
runoffs. This runs into turbid surface 
waters, Santiago’s main drinking water 
source, which compromises the supply 
to the urban networks. In February 2013 
and April 2016, the SMR experienced 

serious difficulties in distributing drinking 
water due to turbidity problems of the 
tributaries that run into the main drinking 
water treatment plants.50 

A stress that will be intensified due to 
climate change is the reduction in water 
reserves, due to the accelerated melting of 
glaciers and Andean snows.51. According 
to the World Resources Institute, Chile is a 
country under risk of high water shortage 
in the coming decades.52 A consequence 
of this is the increased rate of drought 
cycles, which could affect the urban 
supply  and  the  agricultural  demand. 
This has been the most heavily affected 
area, due to being the largest consumer 
of water; it uses 78% of the national water 
resources53. Hydroelectric generation, 
mining, and industry, amongst others, are 
all activities that could also be altered by 
water scarcity54.

Climate change effects pose an enormous 
challenge,  concerning  both  their

understanding and planning of a region 
adapting to them. This phenomenon 
represents an opportunity for the city to 
implement and/or improve preparation 
and mitigation measures against possible 

natural and anthropogenic phenomena, 
through  several  measures,  such  as 
reusing wastewater or reducing the heat 
island by planting trees.

3.1. REGIONAL COMPLEXITY

One of the main characteristics of the 
SMR, bred from its accelerated growth 
process, is its high level of urbanization 
and concentration of goods and services. 
Although  this  condition  is  typical  of 
many  Latin  American  countries,  the 
metropolitan area of Santiago has one of 
the world’s highest levels: over 40% of the 
national population lives in the region55. 
This places a heavy burden on national 
functions and activities, generating a 
demographic, economic and political 
over-concentration that turns the SMR 
into the country’s most complex region.

The root of this urban condition can be 
linked to the rural-to-urban migration 
process that occurred in the first half of 
the 20th century, which then subsequently 
increased with migrations from medium-
sized  cities.  Santiago,  the  country’s 
political  capital,  promoted  multiple 
economic activities that entailed labor 
opportunities for peasants and working 
class masses, which, in conjunction with 
multiple public and private investments, 
accentuated a significant concentration 
of activities and services. Hence why 
urban expansion was accelerated at 
the expense of both agricultural land 
and  natural  hazard  areas.  Santiago 
consolidated itself as a large city, with 
almost no planning, which generated 
most of the urban issues it faces today.

The first challenge is to address urban 
segregation,  which  translates  into 
socio-spatial fragmentation and 
territorial inequality. The disparities 
faced by the city can be noted in unequal 
housing,  tools,  infrastructure  and 
conditions of services scattered across 
the land. Focusing public investment 

precisely on improving such conditions 
is necessary, not only in overcoming 
quantitative, but also qualitative and 
standard gaps.

The regional challenge of fragmentation 
is not only reflected in social teSMR. Like 
many other areas of this type around 
the  world,  its  current  metropolitan 
management model suffers from an 
institutional overlap, which in turn 
generates duplicities, lack of coordination, 
inability to integrate policies into the area 
and the inability to generate integral or 
comprehensive urban policies.
 
This reality, coupled with a high degree 
of  political  centralism,  renders 
decision-making difficult, by limiting the 
Region’s harmonious and comprehensive 
development  process.  The  central 
government defines and operates many 
policies  and  programs  in  a  uniform 
manner, without necessarily passing 
through intermediate or local governance 
levels, and many territorial decisions 
lacking completion and coordination 
are made by local governments, giving 
way  to  several  shocks  and  urban 
disorders. National policies do not take 
into account the reality of the region, and 
local decisions generate a somewhat 
fragmented metropolitan governance56.

As we have described above, many of 
the region’s challenges arise from its 
metropolitan nature. The Regional 
Developme    nt  Strategy  identified 
segregation,  urban  marginality, 
habitability problems, lack of connectivity, 
insecurity and pollution as constraints to 
human development57. Understanding 
and admitting this metropolitan nature

56. (Orellana, 2009).

On the other hand, the confinement of 
Santiago’s  basin  hinders  the  valley’s 
atmospheric  ventilation,  generating 
higher levels of pollution and an urban 
heat island, increasing temperatures due 
to urbanization and human activities. 
Additionally, the high Coastal Range acts 
as a catalyst for the rain shadow effect. 
Henceforth, humidity on the leeward side 
drops, increasing aridity, mainly in the 
northern area of the SMR. This results in it 
becoming a restriction to the agricultural 
production systems of said area. Lastly, 
the presence of the San Ramón fault on 
the eastern edge of the Santiago basin 
is a latent risk factor, not only for the 
communities residing on it, but for the 
entire city and region.

will allow for the regions’ districts to be 
better integrated.

Lastly, the geographic aspect of the 
region counts as one of its complexities. 
The  city  of  Santiago  is  located  in  a 
tectonic basin that is enclosed on all 
sides, rendering connectivity with the 
surrounding areas difficult. This narrow 
territory increases the environmental 
value of little flat land, hindering urban 
expansion. The city currently occupies 
45% of the space available at the bottom 
of the basin. Likewise, flooding prone 
zones due to their geological condition, 
found north of the city, hinder urban 
location. Additionally, the expansion of 
the city at the piedmont of the Andes 
increases the risk of floods caused by 
the rivers and streams that descend like 
torrents from the Andean mountain range 
towards the basin, resulting in frequent 
emergencies and catastrophes that are 
increased due to the mere existence of 
population located in risk areas.

4.1.  METHODOLOGY TO DEVELOP THE HUMAN AND 
RESILIENT SANTIAGO STRATEGY

The Resilient Santiago team used an 
innovative in-depth thematic method by 
generating a participatory process and 
integrating inputs generated by several 
key  stakeholders.  The  development 
thereof  is  structured  based  on  the 
integration of two main inputs: 

a) bibliographic review and b) participatory 
process. For each of these tasks, we 
developed inputs that were integrated into 
the strategy. The methodological process 
and its components are described in the 
following scheme:

4.2. HUMAN AND RESILIENT SANTIAGO STRATEGY 
PREPARATION PROCESS

The  Strategy  process  began  with  the 
launching workshop of the 100RC program 
on 17th June 2015. The event commenced 
in an introductory plenary session with 140 
participants, followed by three working 
sessions where 96 representatives of the 
national, regional and local government, 
of the private sector and of civil society, 
participated. The results of this workshop’s 
work were materialized in a report that set 
the foundations for the strategy preparation 
process.  The  workshop  identified  the 
shocks and stresses prioritized by the 
participants, and drew up a list of 162 
key stakeholders that could influence the 
construction of a more resilient region.

In  January  of  2016,  the  CRO  of 
Santiago began working in the Regional 
Government. Its first task was to prepare 
a detailed diagnosis of the region’s status 
of resilience, through several means. First, 
a list of 659 public and private actions 
that were being developed by the city was 
compiled. This, in order to understand “who 
are the ones preparing actions of resilience 
in the region and how they are doing it”. 
Additionally, strategic planning and citizen 
perception documents that could guide 
the development of the Resilience Strategy 
were analyzed. Perceptions of resilience 
pertaining to the inhabitants of the SMR, 
experts and citizens included, were also 
analyzed. 

Prominent professionals were interviewed 
for an expert analysis, supplemented by 
information collected from two workshops 
that included 115 stakeholders from the 
government,  private  entities  and  civil 
society. Citizen perception was obtained 
by analyzing the Perception and Public 
Opinion Study in the Metropolitan Region 

of Santiago, with a sample of 750 people65. 
The results were analyzed in May 2016, 
in  a  two-day  working  session,  which 
concluded with the identification of the 
city’s priority resilience issues and cross-
cutting principles, that later became the 
structure of the document “Preliminary 
Resilience  Assessment”,  published  in 
August 2016. 
 
Phase  2  was  aimed  at  the  in-depth 
thematic  process  of  the  work  lines 
identified as priorities in the PRA. To this 
end, the aim was to integrate a broad vision, 
by including strategic partners related to 
each of the pillars, who elaborated different 
inputs recommending short, medium and 
long-term plans, actions and programs, 
closely collaborating with the Resilient 
Santiago  team.  In  addition,  a  Public-
Private Resilience Council was established, 
consisting of 35 experts from academia, 
government, NGOs, the private sector and 
professional associations. The purpose 
of this council was to provide decision-
making advice during the process. 

In order to support the integration of the 
different  inputs,  a  workshop  was  held 
between  19th  and  20th  December 
2016, called FOO (Field of Opportunities 
Workshop),  whereby  the  Strategy’s 
approach,  pillars  and  objectives  were 
validated  by  the  100RC  team.  Lastly, 
between January  and  March  2017, 
the Resilient Santiago team led the task 
of structuring the Strategy, developing 
content, integrating the information and 
finally validating the document developed 
with key stakeholders and members of the 
Resilience Council.

a. Principles

The approach and construction of a more human and resilient Santiago includes 4 
principles that in turn guide the preparation of this Resilience Strategy. These principles 
arise from the Human Santiago approach. These are:

1.
Human 
approach

Which  places  people  and  their 
particularities at the center of the 
discussion, prioritizing their quality 
of life and experience of living in 
the city

2.
Participative 
city

Which  includes  the  opinions 
and  ambitions  of  society’s  key 
stakeholders in decision-making, 
by means of effective and binding 
participation instances

3.
Territorial 
intelligence

Recognizing the particularities of 
each territory for evidence-based 
decision making

4.
Promoting the 
right to the city

Providing access to all of the city’s 
benefits, and levelling the playing 
field  among  the  districts  of  the 
Metropolitan Region. 

  | Human & Resilient Santiago Strategy ||  Section 5  ||  100 Resilient Cities   |  b. Elementos transversales
| 56 |

b. Transversal Elements

Transversal elements are characteristics that transcend the sectoral pillars of 
this strategy, and that encapsulate the ways in which we intend to face the different 
regional problems. These elements are governance and intersectorality. They 
are the hallmark of the proposals presented herein, as they seek to solve the different 
challenges in a comprehensive and coordinated way, with a regional approach, despite 
territorial and sectoral fragmentation. 

Intersectorsality

Governance

Governance

There are a number of elements and actions that are needed in place to build a city; 
these include having a political leadership supported by a competent institutional 
structure, promoting dialogue between multiple stakeholders, articulating several 
initiatives, proposing a strategic approach, channeling conflicts and, above all, listening 
to what the inhabitants have to say. 

This is key in addressing the challenges that the SMR has to face. In a highly centralist 
country like Chile, and set in a context of territorial fragmentation due to a system made 
up of urban and rural districts, among which there is little coordination and limited 
dialogue with the Regional Government, having the figure of a Metropolitan Authority 
with clear attributions is highly necessary. Likewise, short-term legal changes related 
to a new regional governance model force us into future scenarios, which will result 
in unprecedented methods of governing these peculiar territories. The strategy for a 
“Human and Resilient Santiago” is aimed precisely at doing this. 

Intersectorality

The complexity of the metropolitan challenges requires an integrated action of policies 
and responses to their problems. This means formulating the different areas of sectoral 
knowledge and expertise in order to address issues that simply cannot be solved in 
a fragmented way. However, intersectorality cannot occur spontaneously; it must 
be articulated, organized and structured so that interinstitutional and intersectoral 
relations can take place, and thus generate the expected results. Intersectorality means 
a new way of planning and executing territorial projects and policies, considering, 
integrating and articulating sectoral interests with a shared approach, providing a 
desirable method of approaching the city’s challenges.

5.2. HOW TO READ THE STRATEGY

The Strategy consists of pillars that in 
turn have objectives developed through 
plans, programs and projects. Each 
of these pillars were identified from the 
work developed during phase 1 and 2 of 
the Strategy-preparation process, and 
their subject matter came from the in-
depth thematic process (See section 4. 
Development of the Resilience Strategy).

Each pillar begins with a description of 
the Problem Status, which gives an 
account of the current situation of the 
topic being presented, and a Map of 
the Metropolitan Area that charts at 
least one of the issues raised in the text. 
The current situation is described below, 
with  an  emphasis  on  Governance: 
Where we are and where we are headed 
to,  accompanied  by  a  Governance 
Reference  on  the  matter,  using 
international cases. 

Some Strategic Partners have also 
been featured for each pillar, contributing 
inputs for the construction of each of the 
pillars of this Strategy. These strategic 
partners delved into each topic through 
academic research, community pilots, 
a transfer of public sector experiences, 
among others, and were key in generating 
content for each thematic pillar. 

The objectives associated with each 
pillar  are  then  developed,  with  their 
plans, programs and projects. A brief 
description  of  the  proposal, the 
status of the action (implemented 
or under planning process), its timing 

(short,  medium  and  long  term)  and 
the main stakeholders involved, is 
provided for each initiative (either plan, 
program or project). In the case of plans 
or programs, a list of linked actions is 
detailed below, which are not exclusive 
of new actions that may be incorporated 
over time.

Certain priority plans, projects or 
programs are identified within each pillar, 
which, due to their specific condition, can 
be recognized as emblematic projects 
that Resilient Santiago will promote for 
future implementation. These priority 
proposals have in turn been linked with 
actions led by other cities of the 100RC 
network, in order to generate joint work 
and knowledge exchange plans.

In  some  cases,  proposals  include 
documents that have been developed 
by third parties, such as policies, plans, 
strategies,  etc.,  and  subject  to  their 
relevance, they have been featured as 
a reference document, by including 
their name and cover photo. 

Finally,  each  pillar  includes  a  local 
reference,  aimed  at  highlighting  a 
proposal or initiative of a municipality or 
provincial government, which serves as 
an example and as good practice that, 
thanks to its characteristics, can then be 
replicated in other territories. 

The strategy consists of 6 pillars, 21 
objectives and 75 plans, programs and 
projects that are detailed below:

Objective  1.1

Plan and promote a multimodal transport 
system with a regional approach

ProMovilidad Urbana Regional Policy 

This  Policy  includes  regional  level 
recommendations  submitted  by  the 
Presidential  Advisory  Committee 
ProMovilidad Urbana of 2014, which 
includes the definition of a Metropolitan 
Authority  with  powers,  faculties  and 
resources to effectively and coherently 
take  action  on  problems  related  to 
the city, land use and urban mobility. 
In  teSMR  of  mobility,  this  Regional 
Policy will allow for the planning and 
the managing of supply and demand, 
articulating investment in infrastructure, 
equipment and its impacts. Efforts will be 
made to ensure that modern, efficient and 
accessible transport systems are put in 

place to improve the quality of life of the 
inhabitants of the Region.

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
2. Comprehensive Urban Mobility Master 
Plan  that  takes  infrastructure  and 
management measures into account.
3. Subway Line Expansion Plan

Commuter Rail Network Project  

The concentration of services, education 
and employment in the capital, have 
created a functional dependency of the 
inhabitants of peripheral settlements 
and those adjacent to the city center, 
generating a huge surge of daily trips 
concentrated in peak hours.

On the other hand, it has been shown over 
time that the construction of highways 
and roads has increased private vehicle 
use, encouraging the expansion of the city 
with low-density peripheral urbanization 
and high car dependency. This city model 
is inefficient in providing a quality public 
transport system, since it must travel 
long distances to meet low demand. 
These  conditions  render  providing 
a  massive,  efficient  and  sustainable 
public  transport  service  incredibly 
difficult. As an alternative solution, the 
region’s commuter rail services offer 
competitive conditions, which allows 
for the improvement and expansion of 
the service, leveraging the existing area 

next to the railway line, increasing the 
frequency and providing intermediate 
intermodal centers at the stations. These 
combined and complementary solutions 
allow us to promote a massive, clean and 
sustainable transport system. 

This program consists of several related 
projects, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Fare Integration of Commuter Rails 
and Public Transport System (buses and 
underground)
2.Melitren Commuter Rail (Santiago-
Melipilla)
3. Nos Express and Rancagua Express

Urban-Rural Mobility Integration Plan

Term: Long Term
Status: Proposal
Stakeholders: GORE, 
SEREMI of Transport and 
Telecommunications, SECTRA, 
DTPM, MINVU, Metro, EFE, 
Civil Society Organizations and 
Municipalities.

The urban sprawl of Santiago, with no 
territorial planning processes, has led to 
rural areas depending on urban areas. 
On the other hand, the quality of service 
of the rural buses is deficient, since they 
provide low coverage, low accessibility 
and all at very high costs due to the lack of 
fare integration with the urban transport 
system. This impacts rural transport 
costs, as well as users’ travel experience. 
This plan is aimed at addressing these 
issues, by understanding the urban-rural 
mobility system as a comprehensive and 
intermodal system. 

This program consists of several related 
projects, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Intermodal Development Plan, aimed at 
identifying the region’s relevant transfer 
points.
2.  Defining  and  implementing  a  fare 
integration model for the region’s urban-
rural transport system.
3. Implementing an exclusion perimeter 
to improve the operation of rural buses. 
4. Policy to develop urban, rural and 
intercity bus terminals for intermodal 
points.

Urban Freight Transport Program

Transporting goods and commodities 
is pivotal in ensuring the city’s proper 
operation.  It  is  currently  a  negative 
externality  due  to  its  environmental 
impacts, weak regulation and congestion 
stemming from loading and unloading 
processes,  which  become  more 
conflictive  during  peak  hours.  This 
program consolidates and implements 
several initiatives, aimed at providing the 
region with a robust and comprehensive 
freight logistics system that takes the 
different urban scales with a regional 
approach into account. 

This program consists of several related 
projects, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Road space rationing in congested 
areas.
2. Incentives for the construction of a 
network of logistics consolidation and 
distribution centers.
3. Information system for urban freight 
management.
4. Intelligent Truck Parking Pilot Project.

Orbital Ring Road Project

Term: Long Term
Status: Proposal
Stakeholders: GORE, 
SEREMI Transport and 
Telecommunications, 
SECTRA, MINVU, Civil 
Society Organizations and 
Municipalities.

The outer ring of Santiago was projected 
and  incorporated  into  the  Santiago 
Metropolitan  Regulation  Plan  in  the 
1960s, along with the Américo Vespucio 
ring, and it is aimed at connecting the 
outlying  districts  of  Colina,  Lampa, 
Huechuraba, Pudahuel, Maipú, Puente 
Alto, La Florida, Peñalolén, La Reina, 
Las  Condes  and  Lo  Barnechea.  This 
ring allows for the decongesting of the 
Americo Vespucio ring and redistributing 

trips to other regions and to the internal 
areas of Santiago. It also generates direct 
connections with other routes, and allows 
for freight transport to circulate beyond 
the  urban  radius,  thus  decongesting 
the current routes through peripheral 
connections  such  as  the  junction  of 
Route 78 and 68. The project has a 130 
km extension and is expected to be built 
in tranches.73

Commission  of  2014  recommends 
that in the decision-making process on 
transport, housing, urban or industrial 
projects, authorities should always put 
the provision and expansion of mass 
public transport services first, playing 
down other modes of transport. In this 
context, promoting those actions and 
projects aimed at improving the quality 
of the mass public transport system is 
necessary, rendering it more sustainable 
and attractive in other ways, focused 
on improving users’ travel experience. 
Likewise, the rebidding process of the 
Surface Bus System seeks to improve 
the fleet and establish new regulatory 
mechanisms to improve service delivery. 

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. New investments to reduce evasion/
Audit  Plan/  Education  and  raising 
awareness  plan  to  improve  public 
transport.
2.  Plan  to  promote  public  transport 
use and thus increase the number of 
passengers.
3. Investments to improve travel times 
through:
- The construction and adaptation of 
existing routes to exclusive corridors for 
Transantiago.
- The consolidation and improvement of 
priority roads for public transport.
4. Management System for the Integrated 
Operation: Fleet Exploitation Support 
System (SAEF).
5.  Enabling  Subway  lines  3  and  6/

Technological modernization project for integrated urban 
mobility management

Term: Medium Term
Status: Proposal
Stakeholders: GORE, 
Ministry of Transport and 
Telecommunications, SECTRA, 
DTPM, Metro and EFE. 

The collection and use of updated data 
generated by the transport network would 
improve management of the transport 
system and the mobility of its users. 
Big  Data  provides  decision-making 
information to both the public sector 
that plans, manages and regulates, as 
well as to private entities that operate 
public and freight transport systems. An 

integrated urban mobility management 
system would support decision making, 
in  order  to  have  more  efficient  and 
effective systems. The correct analysis 
of this information would allow steering 
actions aimed at reducing travel times, 
reducing  environmental  impact  and 
operating costs.

DTPM, MINVU, SERVIU, MOP 
and Municipalities.

Considering the urban sprawl of Gran 
Santiago,  and  the  deterioration  and 
abandonment of the city’s intermediate 
areas,  the  proposal  to  consolidate 
an  intermediate  bypass  for  public 
transport would allow for the recovering 
and revitalizing of the city’s pericentral 
areas and would improve connectivity 
and  access  to  public  transport.  The 
intermediate  bypass,  formed  by  the 
avenues Departamental, Las Rejas, Dorsal 

and Pedro de Valdivia, directly benefits 14 
districts74 of the Metropolitan Region, 
connects with circular transportation 
roads and provides travel options that 
avoid having to enter the downtown area. 

This bypass has been consolidated in 10 
of the 14 districts with priority to public 
transport. Some districts are still left 
in order to fully improve the transport 
platform.

structural core 

The Nueva Alameda Providencia Project is 
aimed at renewing the most emblematic 
structural core of the city of Santiago, and 
it has been proposed as a comprehensive 
urban recovery project that prioritizes 
public  transportation,  with  cultural, 
social,  historical,  urban  and  mobility 
implications. In 2015, an international 
public  competition  defined  the  best 
alternative to developing the study of the 

project that covers over 12 kilometers, 
from Pajaritos to Tobalaba, integrating 
the districts of Lo Prado, Estación Central, 
Santiago and Providencia. The Nueva 
Alameda  Providencia  project  stands 
out for having incorporated a citizen 
participation process at a regional level 
right from its design stage, recognizing 
the individualities of each territory and 
the complexity of the city’s logic.

SERVIU. 

According to data from the Ministry of 
Energy, Chile’s economic growth has led 
to a 122% rise in energy consumption 
between 1991 and 201184. 25% of the total 
energy consumed in the Metropolitan 
Region is at a household level, and in 
recent times, there has been a 2.5% rise in 
per capita consumption. In order to curb 
this trend, preparing an energy reduction 
plan has been proposed, which must 
take into account households, SMEs, 
industries and the public sector, including 
the incorporation of renewable energies, 
audits, minimum standards, training and 
citizen education on a conscious use of 
energy.

3. Waste reduction incentive system.
4. Studying the different modalities of

pilot experiences and proposing the best 
alternatives for the city of Santiago in 
this regard. 

Poor waste management and its ultimate 
disposal  in  landfills  generates  high 
environmental and health costs (soil, 
air and water). In addition, it creates 
high economic costs for municipalities, 
which, through private companies or self-
management, merely collect, transport 
and  finally  dispose  of  said  waste  in 
landfills, with no waste management 
involved. The waste recovery program 
is aimed at promoting comprehensive 
and articulated regional work on waste 
management  and  ultimate  disposal 
processes,  with  the  various  key 
stakeholders involved. Waste recovery 
through recycling is key to achieving this 
goal. In addition to the management of 
a network of clean points, it must also 
involve steady work with the community, 
in order for citizens to become aware 
and to be actively involved in the waste 
problem. At the same time, it expects 
to  generate  incentives  for  recovery 
and  segregated  ultimate  disposal, 
using  technologies  (such  as  mobile 
applications) that encourage recycling 
by connecting people and waste-pickers.

Rural Drinking Water Program (*)

In  Chile,  groundwater  for  human 
consumption in urban areas accounts 
for 40% of the total volume consumed 
and, in the case of rural drinking water, 
76%93.  There  are  currently  a  little 
over 100 rural drinking water services 
managed by neighborhood committees 
or cooperatives advised by the Ministry of 
Public Works, who support investments 
to retain and expand infrastructure and 
equipment works. On the other hand, 
about  2500  houses  in  the  rural  area 
are still provided with drinking water by 
means of water trucks94 and 54,740 
people in rural areas have poor drinking 
water supplies.95

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below.

Related actions:

1. Constructing new rural drinking water 
services in semi-concentrated localities 
where their current supply is precarious, 
leveraging  sectoral  and  regional 
resources.
2. ●Improving existing services based on 
priority infrastructure requirements, in 
order to ensure service continuity.
3. Promoting technological innovations 
on water supply for human consumption 
in areas suffering from water scarcity.
4.  Advising and training rural drinking 
water committees and cooperatives in 
service management. 
5. ●Preparing the implementation of the 
New Rural Drinking Water Act in the 
Region.

Objective 2.6

Promote the use on non-conventional 
renewable energy

2.6.1. 

Regional Energy Plan 

The Regional Energy Plans (PER) are 
created based on the goals and actions 
defined in the 2050 Energy Policy Agenda, 
and they reflect the region’s approach to 
energy and set the territorial conditions 
for its development, in accordance with 
the Regional Development Strategies96. 
Regional energy projects are currently 
developed in a rather piecemeal fashion, 
and  do  not  adhere  to  a  strategic 
territorial planning process. Creating 
an Energy Plan adapted to the actual 
reality of the Metropolitan Region that 
recognizes the best use of land, that 
includes participatory processes with 
local communities and integrates the 
existing land-use planning instruments, 

is  necessary.  As  a  result,  projects 
that  contribute  towards  building  a 
comprehensive regional approach can 
be implemented.

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Stage 1 execution: Diagnosis 
2. Stage 2 preparation: Plan Development 
3. Workshops and working sessions 
of  the  regional  energy  development

Mini-hydros construction project

Term: Medium term
Status: Proposal
Responsable: GORE, SEREMI 
of Energy, SEREMI of Public 
Works (DGA, DOH), SEREMI of 
Environment, Municipalities and 
Social Organizations

The  Maipo  River  and  its  tributaries 
-including  the  Mapocho  River  serve 
as  the  main  source  of  water  for  the 
Metropolitan Region. The extension of 
the hydrographic basin of the Maipo river 
(15380 km.), along with its significant 
average annual flow (92.3m3/sec), 97 
provides the opportunity to use waters 
for generating electricity. In this respect, 

the proposal is for a program to use hydro 
energetic sources by building Mini-hydros 
creating a network that contributes to the 
Central Interconnected System. These 
types of power plants are deemed as 
Non-Conventional Renewable Energy 
(NCRE) due to the fact that they generate 
less than 20 megawatts of power

Waste to Energy Plan (*)

The Metropolitan Region produces about 
2.8 million tons of household solid waste 
(RSD) per year, of which around 98% are 
disposed of in landfills98. The Waste to 
Energy Plan is aimed at promoting energy 
generation through the capturing of gases 
that arise from the breakdown of organic 
matter (biogas) that exists in waste, thus 
generating a sustainable energy system. 

The aim is to expand and replicate the 
experience of the Loma Los Colorados 
landfill in Til Til, which since 2009 has had 
a biogas plant that generates electricity 
that is later injected into the Central 
Interconnected System. Consequently, it 
has become a Small Means of Distributed 
Generation (PMGD).

Santiago Solar regional solar program 

Chile is amongst the countries that have 
the world’s highest solar radiation, and 
as a result it is automatically classed 
as a privileged territory for generating 
solar  energy,  both  for  heating  and 
consumption. A characteristic of this 
energy is its versatility of how it can be 
put to use: from photovoltaic panels for 
household consumption to large facilities 
for industrial use. The “Santiago Solar” 
program is aimed at encouraging the 
generation and use of solar energy in 
both rural and urban contexts, and to 
further  apply  it  in  different  contexts, 
including household, industrial, SMEs, 
and agricultural, to name a few.

This program consists of several related 
actions and programs, listed below:

Related actions: 

1. Solar energy for Rural Drinking Water 
systems.
2. Conversion program for SMEs.
3.  Household  Photovoltaic  System: 
distributed  generation  and  self-
consumption.
4. Thermal Solar Systems Program (in 
public, residential, industrial buildings)..
5.  Solar  Roofing  Program  (public, 
residential and industrial).

This plan consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1.  Recovering historic and civic centers.
2. Special plans for emerging issues 
(illegal trade, alcohol consumption in 
public spaces, etc.).
3.  Self-care  campaigns  for  crime 
prevention.

Santiago’s urban centers contain several 
areas that have a high concentration of 
commercial, cultural, educational and 
productive activities, with a high public 
rate. This reality, coupled with a number 
of  physical  fstakeholders  generated 
by the built-up space and the lack of 
citizen preventive measures tend to be 
conducive to crime. The intervention plan 
in Urban Centers is aimed at coordinating 
medium and long-term interventions, 
implementing public/private intersectoral 
work  methodologies,  and  to  support 
the  management  and  control  of  the 
institutions involved. Actions include 
situational prevention projects such as 
teleprotection systems, providing lights 
in unsafe areas with high public rates, 
renovation  of  empty  lots,  bus  stops, 
stands, street furniture, among other

(PCSP)  are  aimed  at  enhancing  the 
role and leadership of municipalities in 
bringing together and articulating local 
stakeholders with crime prevention and 
insecurity powers. Based on a diagnosis 
made, Public Security Councils define 
their priorities and validate community 
and investment strategies, programs 
and projects that are aimed at solving 
violence, crime, co-existence and issues 
of insecurity.

This proposal is aimed at incorporating 
security as a transversal axis of urban 
projects, regarding both their design 
and  execution;  as  has  been  done 
previously with the gender approach. 
The aim is to carry out pioneering work 
at  a  metropolitan  level,  including  a

initiatives that involve and affect the city 
as a whole, especially inter-municipal 
projects.

This proposal consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Integrating the security component as 
a requirement to apply to FNDR projects 
that are not related to security.
2. Consider the immediate environment 
in the design of concession roads and 
public works, with a special emphasis 
placed on avoiding residual spaces and 
those lacking pedestrian accessibility, 
which end up becoming unsafe public 
spaces.

Recovery plan for empty lots and deteriorated public 
spaces (*). 

This plan consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Gradually implementing tiny squares 
(plazas de bolsillo) in empty lots, providing 
a temporary and sustainable use to said 
places.
2.  Promoting  projects  to  recover 
deteriorated public spaces.
3. Regenerating urban edges..

There  are  over  4,000  empty  lots  in 
the Metropolitan Region, which total 
around 6,500 hectares.103 At least 400 
of them are owned by the state.104 These 
abandoned spaces are fire risk sources, 
small dump sites, potential criminal and 
alcohol consumption areas, among other 
things. Enabling empty lots to be located 
in the middle of the city as temporary 
public spaces can lead to encouraging 
pedestrian flows, transforming the urban 
image, providing security, encouraging 
citizen  participation  and  diversifying 
local commerce by creating meeting 
places. Additionally, incorporating citizen 
participation methodologies to recover 
deteriorated  public  spaces  activates 
community networks and improves the 
sense of security.

other  mechanisms  enabling  it  to 

address incivilities, contraventions and 
misdemeanors  and  minor  crimes  at 
neighborhood levels and with a restorative 
component. As a result, processes will 
be faster and incarceration rates for 
cases of lower social significance will 
drop.  This  should  be  complemented

In order to achieve a good citizen security 
strategy, it is essential that there be 
co-responsibility, i.e., the proportion of 
responsibility assumed by the citizens, as 
well as municipal authorities, regarding 
the identification, prioritization, financing, 
management, supervision, evaluation, 
monitoring and maintenance of a specific 
violence prevention project108. The greater 
the role played by the citizens in fostering 
security,  the  greater  the  impact  and 
sustainability will be over time, as local 
resources are developed to prevent and 
deal with crime. Most successful violence 

prevention measures involve people in the 
active search for practical and effective 
solutions.

Public-private work plan for crime reduction

Private security plays a significant role 
in  controlling  and  deterring  certain 
types  of  crime,  especially  those 
against  property.  A  well-regulated 
and  implemented  promotion  favors 
the monitoring of spaces and reduces 
victimization rates. New technologies 
enable the development of increasingly

In the event of a crime, the victim care 
network incorporates several services 
and care in crime reporting, reparation, 
prosecution and media treatment areas. 
When a person is a victim of a crime, 
especially a violent one, a quick and 
timely response is required; and if the 
aim is to aid in repairing any damages, it 
is imperative that care is comprehensive 
and specialized. On the other hand, it is 
also important for people to overcome 
the negative consequences of crime 
victimization and to avoid secondary 
victimization. By encouraging networking 
of the different institutions, a greater 
coordination can be established between 
them,  allowing  them  to  define  case 
referral protocols.

Regional Risk Management Policy 

In  2016,  the  National  Committee  for 
Natural Disaster Resilience (CREDEN) 
proposed creating a national research, 
development and innovation (R+D+I) 
strategy for natural disasters. This action 
is aimed at the regional implementation 
of the Commission’s recommendations, 
through  the  articulated  work  of  the 
different stakeholders and institutions 
related  to  resilience  issues,  such  as 
universities, ONEMI, the public and private 
sector and civil society. Among them, it 
is worth mentioning a territorial data and 
information integration system of public 
access, which would allow integrating 
existing yet fragmented information, often 
in incompatible formats, and it would also 

enable decisions to be taken for regional 
investment planning and prioritization, 
in addition to being an important input 
in times of emergencies and disasters. 

This policy consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Designing and implementing the Policy.
2.  Integrated  Territorial  Information 
System for Risk Management. 
3. Map of hazards of the Metropolitan

Due  to  its  geographical  nature,  the 
Metropolitan Region is highly exposed 
to seismic hazards. As a result, adapting a 
resilience approach that takes the phases 
of the risk cycle (mitigation, prevention, 
reaction and reconstruction) into account 
is necessary. The “Seismic Risk” program 
intends to articulate the different seismic 
risk management strategies for the region 
in an integrated and coordinated way. 
Since it is understood that there are 
different  variables  affecting  seismic 
vulnerability, existing initiatives (such as 
the Seismicity Monitoring Program in 
mountain range areas, where a sensor 
system  was  placed  in  ravines)  and 
vulnerability studies are included, and 
new actions are proposed re¬garding 
protocols, security zones and updating 
of  building  standards.  Overall,  these 
actions form an innovative approach 
to  earthquakes  and  incorporate 
a  comprehensive  and  proactive 
metropolitan strategy.

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Monitoring program and seismic early 
warning system in mountainous areas.
2. Recognizing and incorporating seismic 
risk fstakeholders in planning tools.
3. Creating security zones in the event of

Hydro-meteorological Hazard Program

The Metropolitan Region is exposed to 
hydro-meteorological hazards, such as 
fluvial  flooding,  barrages,  landslides, 
pluvial flooding, urban floods and water 
stress.  The  region’s  topography  and 
urban configuretion, specifically in the 
precordillera, influence the recurrence 
of these types of hazards. In teSMR of 
climate change, these events could be 
exacerbated  by  rising  temperatures, 
precipitation  variations  and  runoff. 
Excessive precipitation will also impact 
pluvial flooding rates. Flow rate changes 
could also lead to water stress situations 
regarding  the  supply  to  urban  and 
agricultural areas. The flood program 
of the Metropolitan Region will allow 
for a comprehensive approach to the 
basin’s water management, with a water-
sensitive city approach. The program will 
take existing and proposed projects into 
account, in order to later define strategic 
water  investments,  including  early 
warning systems, master plans, works 
and equipment. 

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Early warning system and monitoring 
of the precordillera and ravines.
2. Recognizing and incorporating hydro-
meteorological risk fstakeholders into 
planning instruments:
• 

Updating the map of landslide and 
flood geological hazards.
Zonation for areas where channels 
and ravines become flooded.

• 

3. Protecting drinking water catchment 
areas.
4.  Cadaster  and  study  of  critical 
infrastructure vulnerabilities.
5.  Regional  systematization  of 
emergency protocols in the event of 
hydro-meteorological emergencies.
6. City insurance for critical equipment 
and  infrastructure  in  the  event  of 
disasters.
7. Barrage control works.
8. Continuous system of flooded parks 
for the infiltration of soils in ravines.
9.  Concluding  investments  of  the 
rainwater master plan.
10. Acquiring and maintaining strategic 
equipment (motor pumps, tanks).

Term: Mediano plazo
Status: En ejecución
Stakeholders: GORE, 
Provincial Governments, ONEMI, 
Fire Department, Ministry of 
Agriculture, CONAF, SEREMI of 
Environment, SEREMI of Public 
Works and Municipalities.

The  2016-2017  season115  holds  the 
country’s  historical  fire  record,  with 
more than 570,000 hectares burnt and 
more than 3,000 fires,116 60 times what 
was destroyed in the previous season 
(between July 2015 and June 2016). As 
for the Metropolitan Region, more than 
38,000 hectares have been destroyed in 
almost 300 wildfires117.

In the past few years, there has been 
a tendency towards significantly lower 
precipitation and rising temperatures 
(which in the future will be even worse 
due  to  the  intensification  of  climate 
change).118 This scenario implies that 
wildfire risk will either be maintained or 
increased. The Fire Prevention and Control 
Program for the Metropolitan Region is 
aimed at increasing preparedness to 
reduce the number of fires that affect 
the natural ecosystem, by updating fire 
protocols, through brigades at critical 
points such as Isolated Hills (Cerros 
Isla) (supported by strategic equipment), 
education campaigns and by updating 
legislation and planning tools. 

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Monitoring program and fire risk early 
warning system. 
2. Recognizing and incorporating fire risk 
fstakeholders into planning instruments.
3. Critical Infrastructure vulnerabilities 
cadaster and assessment.
4.  Fire Protocol for the Metropolitan 
Region.
5. City insurance for critical equipment 
and  infrastructure  in  the  event  of 
disasters. 
6. Updating legislation regulating forestry 
and monoculture industries. 
7. Plan for reforestation of burnt lands.
8. Reinforcement of Conaf brigades in 
critical points of the city (Isolated Hills 
(Cerros Isla), etc.).
9. Procurement of strategic equipment:

The  city  is  periodically  shaken  by 
emergencies, disasters and other impacts 
that affect its normal operation. During 
recent years, Santiago has been faced 
with drinking-water supply disruptions 
due to channel turbidity, power cuts, 
shutdowns  and  strikes  that  affect 
garbage collection and even metropolitan 
transport  system  disruptions.  These 
situations create an imbalance that can 
be reduced by means of an adjusted 
future planning. The “Prepared Santiago” 
emergency protocol program is aimed 
at  developing  protocols  of  action  in 
conjunction with key stakeholders in each 
thematic area, in order to identify gaps, 
define related action plans and articulate 
a network that can be activated in the 
event of an emergency. 

This proposal consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

Community Strengthening Plan in the event of Foothill Multi-
Hazards 

The piedmont is the area of the pre-
cordillera  near  Santiago,  located 
between the Maipo and the Mapocho 
rivers, a territory of the SMR consisting 
of  6  districts.  In  this  area,  there  are 
different ravines and channels, mainly 
the  Quebrada  de  Ramón  and  the 
Quebrada de Macul. In 1982, 1986, 1993, 
2005, 2008 and 2016, there were heavy 
runoffs and mudslides from barrages. 
Additionally, this area combines several 
hazards, since the geologically active 

fault  called  San  Ramón  can  also  be 
found there. Strengthening community 
networks through citizen participation, 
communication and education are crucial 
for risk prevention and risk information in 
this area. It is aimed at developing and 
implementing a community strategy to 
collect information on risk perception in 
the area, in order to create a protocol to 
define neighborhood and local actions 
for the community to participate in the 
response to future impacts in the area.

Creation of a regional network of municipalities for managing 
and reducing the risk of socio-natural disasters

There are international risk management 
protocols such as those of the World 
Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  the 
United Nations Office for Disaster Risk 
Reduction (UNISDR), which prioritize the 
government’s ability to properly respond 
to an emergency. In this capacity, the 
aim is to strengthen the management, 
organization and coordination skills of 
regional and municipal officials in the 

event of catastrophes. This can be done 
by formulating better instruments and 
protocols that are informed by the best 
practices and local knowledge, to then 
influence the decision-making in such 
circumstances. The initiative includes 
continuous training of public officials in 
conjunction with relevant universities, to 
work on disaster management issues.

Regional Emergency Volunteer Coordinator  

After  every  emergency,  disaster  or 
catastrophe, thousands of people are 
activated to provide support, through 
different voluntary actions. This reality, 
coupled  with  the  actions  of  several 
NGOs  and  civil  institutions  present 
in  the  territory,  require  a  strategic 

territorial coordination in order to avoid 
the over-intervention of territories and to 
effectively aid the areas most affected. 
It also requires monitoring interventions 
and coordinating voluntary work with the 
territory’s key stakeholders.

Risk Management Education Program

Disaster risk reduction education and 
communication take into account the 
relationships between impacts on the 
community, the environment and the 
economy, among others. It promotes 
critical thinking and improved decision-
making skills. With geography such as that 
of the Metropolitan Region, it is essential 
that citizens are informed and prepared 
to act in the event of an emergency. 
Although  it  is  a  recurring  theme, 
progress must be made in developing 
new  strategies  and  instruments  to 
promote risk education, by fostering a 
proactive and preventive culture. The 
inhabitants  of  each  of  the  region’s 
districts must be aware of their risks 
and vulnerabilities, including memories of 
past disasters and the different scenarios 
to which they are exposed. This can be 
further  complemented  by  including 

new  technologies  that  can  generate 
information accessible to the region’s 
inhabitants.

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Community disaster risk reduction 
education.
2. School Security Plan.
3. Memorials commemorating disasters. 
Seismic  exhibition,  urban  landmarks 
that serve as reminders of floods, fires 
impacts etc.
4.  “Grand  Challenges”  Program  or 
Resilience Challenge, based on resilience 
and  disaster  issues,  with  an  annual 
competition and focused on students.

One  of  the  main  problems  in  the 
Metropolitan Region is that there is no 
relationship between infrastructure and 
territorial development projects at the 
different levels of government: inter-
municipal, regional and provincial. Under 
an integrated and long-term approach, 
the Regional Infrastructure Plan 2041 
proposes  the  construction  of  an 
innovative and sustainable region, in order 
to link programs and projects in an inter-
sectoral and inter-municipal fashion. 
This will allow for the structuring of a 
cross-cutting, forward-looking approach, 
promoting investment in the SMR and its 
development based on comprehensive 
and coordinated proposals. 

This plan consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Developing a comprehensive regional 
infrastructure plan that takes into account 
the different sectors that operate within 
the territory.
2.  Carrying  out  strategic  territorial

Support and promotion plan for the agro-industrial sector of 
the metropolitan 

The Metropolitan Region of Santiago 
is  complex,  with  a  territorial  duality 
between urban and rural areas, the former 
being home to most of the economic 
activity,  mainly  regarding  services 
and commerce. Although 97% of the 
population of the Metropolitan Region 
lives in urban areas129, rural areas do 
indeed  play  an  important  economic, 
social, environmental and cultural role. 

In this sense, building a communications 
and  specialized  consultancy  plan  is 
necessary in encouraging the application 

to development programs and plans 
in  rural  areas,  so  as  to  foster  the 
development and productive diversity 
of the region.

Small and medium-sized enterprises 
are extremely vulnerable, rendering the 
continuity  of  their  operations  during 
emergency situations difficult. They are 
usually not prepared, nor do they have 
the  support  needed  to  resume  their 
operations following a disaster, especially 
if they depend on other infrastructures 
in order to operate. This action is aimed 

at analyzing their production chains and 
finding mitigation mechanisms required 
to reduce the impact on their operations, 
thus ensuring their capacity to adapt to 
emergencies and crises. The Continuity

Positioning Santiago as a global city

Strategic Plan to promote the Santiago City Brand 

In  recent  years,  Santiago  has  been 
considered an attractive city to the rest of 
the world, appearing in international media 
such as the New York Times, National 
Geographic and CNN International, where 
it has been cited as safe, modern, etc. 
However, there is no campaign-related 
hallmark positioning it globally, as has 
happened with other world cities such 
as Madrid, London or Amsterdam, and 

thus increasing their number of visits. 
This requires designing a strategy that 
enhances and positions the city as the 
economic and financial center of Latin 
America, in addition to enhancing its 
tourist attractions. This action is linked 
to the creation of the “Santiago” brand as 
a business-making platform and as an

Strategic Plan of the Regional Tourism Corporation

The Regional Tourism Corporation is a 
public-private coordination body created 
in late 2016, aimed mainly at promoting 
tourism for Santiago to become Chile’s 
main tourist destination, as well as a 
center of attraction for conventions and 
large seminars at a Latin American level. 
The strategic plan is aimed at positioning 
Santiago within the status of cities such 
as Barcelona or Buenos Aires, which 
already  have  tourism  corporations, 
whilst also enabling it to strengthen its 
image and to create jobs in an industry 
that has the potential to become an 
economic driver for tourism at a city and 
regional level. The proposals include the 
“Santiago Ciudad Viva” program, aimed 
at a national and international promotion 

of the Metropolitan Region’s activities 
(culture, sports, art, seminars, etc.), and 
becoming a platform for information 
and global communication, similar to 
international platfoSMR such as Time 
Out.130 

This plan consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Local entrepreneurship is one of the 
fstakeholders that increase resilience, 
as it stimulates the creation and well-
being of employment.131 An example of 
this is the social innovation sector that is 
focused on improving the quality of life 
of vulnerable individuals or companies 
working in the environmental sector. The 
innovation ecosystem needs to promote 
the creation of ideas and projects to 
solve local problems. However, there 
are  fstakeholders  affecting  it,  such 
as  technological  absorption,  cultural 
acceptance, lack of funding available 

and  the  quality  of  entrepreneurship 
networks. Several actions and programs 
have  been  proposed  to  strengthen 
the  entrepreneurial  ecosystem  in  a 
comprehensive way. 

This program consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Campaign to promote entrepreneurial

systematized assessment of the policies, 
plans and programs designed mainly 
by the Ministry of Economy, in order to 
get acquainted with their economic and 
social impacts beyond investment. As 
a result, pertinent modifications can be 

made to improve entrepreneur support 
programs through a regional platform.

Regional policy on children and adolescents (niños, niñas y 
adolescentes) (NNA) protection with a legal approach.

At  the  regional  level,  the  number  of 
children and adolescents (niños, niñas 
y adolescentes) in vulnerable situations 
and who are at risk has increased, and 
in some cases, NNAs end up becoming 
involved  in  criminal  activities.  As  a 
result of this, a regional policy focused 
on  reducing  risk  fstakeholders  and 
fostering pro-social behavior in children 
and adolescents is required, along with 
the development of the family’s protective 
capacities and parental competences. 
With the 24 Hours Program, aimed at 
children and youth between the ages 
of 10 and 17 and their relevant families, 
the idea is to design and consolidate a 
policy that includes early detection and 
multisystem therapy components. Key 
to this is the articulated work between 

Carabineros and Municipalities in those 
cases  where  NNA  break  the  law  or 
demonstrate transgressive behaviors, 
in order to detect risk profiles and thus act 
in a timely and comprehensive manner. 
This policy is composed of a series of 
linked actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1. Specialized accompaniment program 
for children and adolescents (NNA) first 
time  infrastakeholderss by law. 
2. Specialized accompaniment program 
for  children  and  adolescents  (NNA) 
infrastakeholderss by law. 
3. High complexity special program for

Program for education and treatment of drug use and abuse, 
focused on young people and adolescents 

Chile is the second OECD country to 
have increased its rate of suicides over 
the last 15 years.139 Medical leaves for 
mental health issues has reached 40%. 
This  implies  high  productivity  costs 
due to absenteeism. In addition to this, 
mental  health  issues  mostly  affect 
vulnerable groups, such as people with 
lower educational levels, youth, women, 
and particularly impacting indigenous 
peoples.140

Despite the magnitude of the problem, 
public  funding  for  mental  health 
programs  is  still  very  low  and  the 
availability  of  places  for  addiction 
treatment is very limited and practically 
non-existent  in  the  case  of  young 
people and adolescents who have not 
broken the law. Updating mental health 
plans and creating addiction treatment 
centers that are focused on vulnerable 
groups,  particularly  adolescents  and 
young people, is necessary. It is also 
necessary to strengthen the role of the 

regional commission in the protection 
of the mentally ill, and in education and 
early prevention programs, by providing 
proper information to citizens on the 
consequences that each type of drug 
has  from  a  social  and  public  health 
perspective.

This policy consists of several related 
actions, listed below:

Related actions:

1.  Treatment  center  for  vulnerable 
adolescents that have not breached the 
law, suffering from alcohol and/or drug 
abuse.
2. Toma Conciencia Program.

Metropolitan Youth Strategy 

At a regional level, creating a Metropolitan 
Youth Strategy is necessary; one which 
includes actions and measures in key 
areas such as leisure and recreation, 
mental and reproductive health, training 
and studies and employability, among 
others, through the comprehensive and 
interdisciplinary  work  of  several  key 
stakeholders.

Forming a work program that is focused 
on young people from a legal perspective, 
and on the development of skills for 
their  incorporation  into  the  system, 

is  imperative.  This  program  should

Regional policy on migrant population 

In  recent  years,  Chile’s  immigrant 
population has grown steadily. Although 
the  country  still  has  a  relatively  low 
number of immigrants in comparison to 
developed countries, the obsolescence 
of  legal  regulations  in  the  area,  in 
conjunction with the vulnerability and 
rights  violation  conditions  that  they 
face,  render  this  subject  a  regional 
priority  issue.  Based  on  information 
gathering and the research conducted 
by the SEREMI of Justice and Human 

Rights between 2014 and 2016, along 
with the results of the “Regional Migration 
Working Group” and inputs collected 
during citizen participatory dialogues, 
the aim is to generate a regional policy 
that will comprehensively address the 
reception, integration and recognition of 
this fraction of the population as part of 
society.

Regional street people policy (PSC)

One of the main dimensions of social 
exclusion is people living in conditions 
of high marginalization, such as street 
people. The Metropolitan Region has the 
country’s highest percentage of street 
people: 47% (5,729) of the total number 
of people registered at the national level. 
The regional group has an average of 5.7 
years living without a home.141

With the implementation of the national 
street  people  policy,  the  aim  is  to 
implement a regional adaptation that 
includes the creation of an IT platform 
for PSC, which generates a digital registry 
and allows the monitoring of each specific 
case.  This  platform  will  also  enable 

collecting and centralizing information 
to create better-tailored programs for this

Region. The program includes cultural 
activities in public spaces, as well as 
the training of cultural managers, and 
promoting  a  free  approach  of  art  to 
the community. The project has three 
fundamental  pillars:  a  network  of 
cultural centers, cultural management 
and regional identity and formation of

6.1. NEXT STEPS

The  resilience  strategy  is  aimed  at 
instrumenting  the  debate  on  how  to 
handle the city’s long-term management, 
keeping a clear understanding of how 
we act today in mind, in order to face 
the  challenges  that  currently  stress 
the lifestyle of Santiago’s inhabitants. 
In this context, it is necessary to take 
measures in different dimensions for the 
future: institutional, interinstitutional and 
international insertion.

Regarding the institutional dimension, we 
will advance in the internal articulation 
of  instances  that,  with  the  common 
goal of addressing the challenges of the 
city, but each using a specific lens, look 
at the territory and lead initiatives with 
different agendas: that of climate change, 
that of intelligent cities, of metropolitan 
areas and of resilience, creating a Unit 
of Cities. The purpose of this initiative 
will be a long-term integration of human, 
material and economic resources, with 
special focus on connecting the efforts of 
multiple stakeholders that are addressing 
concrete  initiatives  to  overcome 
Santiago’s structural inequality.

Undoubtedly,  the  leadership  of  the 
regional public services, as thematic 
experts,  meant  that  the  reflection 
around the issues was specific enough 
to identify the gaps and the opportunities 

for improvement, actively participating as 
a counterparty of the consultancies, them 
being more relevant to the Regional reality. 
In the future, this type of coordination 
will allow for the mobilization of external, 
national and international resources to 
execute specific projects that contribute 
to achieving what has been expressed in 
the strategy.

Likewise, we will propose a work agenda 
to the Regional Metropolitan Council to 
transfer each of the consultancies that 
have been an input to the diagnosis and 
actions to be implemented, consistent 
with the current Regional Development 
Strategy and with the regional policies 
that the council itself has led and others 
that urgently need to be incorporated into 
the agenda.

On the other hand, in the interinstitutional 
dimension, we will put a special emphasis 
on deepening a collaborative work model 
based on the explicit recognition that 
there  is  a  generation  of  knowledge, 
accumulated experience and concrete 
practices  that  are  beyond  the  usual 
management of the regional government, 
and that have addressed issues such as 
mobility, environment, security, economic 
development and risk management for 
years, in order to stimulate synergies 
and learning. In this context, the Public-

|  Resilience Strategy  | |  Human & Resilient Santiago  | |  Santiago Metropolitan Region   |  | 181  |

aspects that are essential for the daily 
life of people, such as mobility, waste 
and security. We have already gathered 
information and analyzed each of the 
cities that will be presented to the CORE 
International Commission and identify a 
first working stage. Likewise, the 100 RC 
network allows access to a platform of 
strategic partners made up of consultants 
and multilateral organization s with which 
a bilateral work agenda has been initiated 
in water, mobility, city insurance and risk 
management areas, among other things.

To  conclude,  this  strategy  has  been 
structured by recognizing the institutional 
transition that the region will experience 
in  teSMR  of  governance,  specifically 
focused on contributing to the discussion 
and operationalizing initiatives that may 
contribute in said direction.

Private Resilience Council will continue 
meeting in order to control and monitor 
the implementation of the Resilience 
Strategy.

Beyond the Resilience Council, there is 
a huge challenge to make progress in 
a bilateral work agenda with concrete 
commitments  to  the  private  sector, 
academia,  municipalities  and  non-
governmental organization present in 
the territory. Thus, first of all, we will 
activate the network of municipalities 
for resilience and initiate a process of 
methodological transfer to other regional 
governments.

As for the international dimension, we 
believe that there is a great asset to be 
found in the 100 resilient cities (100RC) 
network, that have much to exchange 
with  our  metropolitan  region,  based 
on certain common structural shocks 
and  stresses.  This  will  allow  us  to 
build  a  specific  international  agenda 
that nurtures the discussion, based on 
comparative experiences, on which are 
the best alternative solutions to regional 
challenges.

A significant contribution of the network 
is undoubtedly the reform on the creation 
of metropolitan areas, since it has allowed 
us to know how governance is concerning

7.1. METHODOLOGICAL PROCESS OF THE HUMAN AND 
RESILIENT SANTIAGO STRATEGY

As described in Chapter IV, the Human and Resilient Santiago Strategy had a 
participatory and innovative methodological process. The process is summarized by 
the integration of two main milestones: a) bibliographical review and b) participatory 
process. Each one was developed with the participation of the key stakeholders 
(See diagram of key stakeholders, chapter IV) and was associated to different tasks 
described below:

a) Bibliographic review. 
b) Participatory process

a. BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW.

1. Review of official regional documents. Strategic planning documents that 
could potentially guide the development of the Resilience Strategy were analyzed, 
including strategies, development plans and programs prepared by different public 
divisions that included certain guidelines to build a regional approach. Among others, 
the documents described in figure 16 stand out.

 2. Analysis of existing plans and programs. By means of official letters sent 
to different units and departments, information was gathered on plans, actions and 
programs that the city was developing. This was carried out in order to understand 
how resilience actions were being implemented in the region and who by.

3. Review of existing actions and initiatives. A list of 659 public and private 
actions that are under development were compiled. From the information gathered, 
a characterization and grouping by common themes could be developed. The main 
actions identified served as a basis for the formulation of several initiatives under 
this strategy. 

Figure 22. Sample list of public and private actions

4. Review of Resilience Strategies of the 100 RC Network. A comparative 
study of the published Resilience Strategies was carried out, in order to identify the 
essential components of both their content and structure.

5. Identification of best practices included in Resilience Strategies. Based 
on the review of the existing Resilience Strategies, best international practices were 
incorporated into each of the thematic axes. This reinforces relations and collaborations 
with other member cities of the 100RC network that share challenges similar to those 
faced by the SMR.

b. PARTICIPATORY PROCESS

1. Technical working groups with different sectors. . The workshops were 
developed based on the methodology of 100 RC, to define the impacts, stresses and 
main challenges of the SMR. Subsequently, working groups were organized for each 
of the pillars. A total of 96 stakeholders from the public and private sector, civil society 
and academia participated. 

2. SMR Opinion Survey.
Citizen perception was obtained by analyzing the Perception and Public Opinion Survey 
in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago with a sample of 750 people145.

3. Interviews with experts. 22 experts and outstanding professionals were 
interviewed. The information was supplemented by inputs from two workshops, which 
included 115 stakeholders from the government, private entities and civil society. 

|  Resilience Strategy  | |  Human & Resilient Santiago  | |  Santiago Metropolitan Region   |  | 191  |

4. Academic reports by pillars. It required the work of 8 academic or research 
institutions146, who each delivered a report that deepened the information on the 
performance of the SMR in regards to the different resilience issues.

5. Pilot projects in communities. Through the implementation of applied 
practical experiments and citizen participation methods147, the experiences of 
different communities were identified, and there was a mutual reflection on the future 
implementation of the Resilience Strategy at a regional level.

6.  In-depth  thematic  process  and  validation  with  Government 
representatives. With the support of the regional teams and SEREMIS, 8 in-depth 
thematic reports on the performance of the SMR in different resilience issues were 
carried out from a public perspective. Further to this, led by the Resilient Santiago 
Team, a workshop was held with representatives of several municipalities in the 
region, aimed at identifying resilience needs from a local governance perspective. 
Through thematic meetings, the various pillars, objectives, plans and programs were 
analyzed with various key stakeholders of the public sector. 

7. Consultancy with international experts of the 100 RC network. Thanks 
to the network of platform partners provided by 100RC, in-depth reports on mobility 
(Ernst and Young), environment (Veolia) and a risk management assessment (Risk 
Management Services) were prepared.

The better the question. The better the answer.�
The better the world works.

 

Towards a cost-justified resilience strategy 
SoW for Santiago de Chile (November, 2016) 
  How resilient is Santiago de Chile to earthquake? 
  What might a rupture of the San Ramón fault cost the city? 
  What is driving the potential for catastrophic shocks in the future? 
  What does this mean for resilience investments today?  

 
What: preliminary, scenario analysis of the economic 
impacts of a rupture on the San Ramón fault (SRF) 
 
Why: inform and mobilize the optimum public policy to 
build resilience holistically to the potential for seismic 
shocks and their related impacts 
 
How: model the damage which could potentially occur in 
the neighboring districts, and the resulting financial costs  
 

Scope: the analysis will… 
  ...be deterministic and at a high level 
  ...account for direct, physical losses to private and public assets 
  ...cover potential losses from a 6.9 and a 7.4 MW earthquake near Falla San Ramon 
  ...include direct losses to assets in the highest hazard districts1 

Key Tasks 
1.  Deterministic Analysis: model losses to current exposure using realistic hazard scenarios  
2.  Historical Analysis: identify indicative, historical events and model losses on today’s exposure 

Deliverable: a short report… 
1.  ...summarizing results of tasks 1-2 in a format that is easily communicated 
2.  ...highlighting key headline messages from the analysis 
3.  ...demonstrating by way of an infographic the probable impacts of a rupture on the SRF 
4.  ...articulating data assumptions and model methodology2 

Timescale 
Assuming the exposure data provided by the city are in good order, RMS will target delivering within four 
weeks of receipt of the data. If it makes sense, an RMS representative may be available to present the 
findings and discuss their impact at the city’s 29th November 2016 conference.

8. Private sector resilience report. A network of companies concerned with 
crisis management and resilience, named SeCRO (see “outstanding action” below), 
developed an input for the Strategy, which enhanced the role of the private sector in 
building resilience for the country. 

SeCRO was created on 26th March 2015. It consists of the companies Abertis 
Autopistas, Aguas Andinas, CGE Distribución, GNL Quintero, Metrogas, Telefónica, 
Transbank and Copec. SeCRO is based on a collaborative approach on crisis 
management, since it is rooted in the principle that there is no single actor who has 
the capacity, knowledge and resources to face one by itself. SeCRO’s main priorities 
are to foster collaboration regarding crisis management, between companies and 
between them and the public sector. This is a medium and long-term initiative. The 
SeCRO wants to contribute to improving the channels of dialogue and communication 
between all stakeholders involved in crisis management, either directly or indirectly, 
through an innovative and proactive business culture, committed to quality of service, 
business continuity and the well-being of the Chilean society.

9. Work meetings with the Resilience Council. Monthly thematic meetings 
were held with members of the Resilience Council. The meetings were conducted in 
accordance to a methodology specifically created to coordinate inputs for each of 
the topics. In addition, systematizations were carried out to then be used as direct 
inputs for the development of the strategy. In order to include the city’s different key 
stakeholders in decision-making on issues related to shocks and stresses, a Public-
Private Advisory Council has been formed. The latter meets once a month. It is made up 
of representatives of the public sector (SEREMIs, representatives of local governments 
and the Intendance), private sector (utility companies, chamber of commerce Chilean 
Chamber of Construction), academia, unions and social organization (For Council 
composition, see next page). For the meetings, the Resilience team has developed a 
working methodology that entails analyzing a representative case for each problem, 
and identifying specific lessons, recommendations and actions that can then be 
implemented at a regional level. This information is systematized after each meeting 
and sent to the participants of the working group, to then direct the proposals to the 
relevant stakeholders.

Gestión de Riesgo 
Cambio climático: Eventos 
Hidrometeorológicos de Alta Intensidad

Es de conocimiento público el actual escenario de Cambio Climático que afecta al 
Planeta.  Dentro  de  este  contexto,  factores  y  elementos  del  Clima  modifican  su 
comportamiento y manifestación, siendo particularmente las Precipitaciones uno 
de  ellos.  Cada  vez  nos  enfrentamos  a  eventos  de  precipitaciones  menos 
frecuentes, incluso en estaciones de lluvia, sin embargo estos se presentan con 
mayor intensidad, aportando importante cantidad de agua en poco tiempo.
De lo anterior debemos asumir que fenómenos como Inundaciones, Aluviones y 
episodios  de  Turbidez  en  las  cuencas,  serán  fenómenos  que  comenzaremos  a 
experimentar con mayor frecuencia.
Históricamente  uno  de  los  episodios  que  ha  afectado  con  mayor  impacto  a  la 
Región Metropolitana, y consideró estas tres variables de riesgo,  corresponde al 
del  día  3  de  mayo  de  1993,  denominado  como  “Aluvión  de  la  Quebrada  de 
Macul”.

Las cifras globales de impacto fueron:
26 personas muertas,
85 heridos,
8 desaparecidos,
32.654 damnificados,
3.846 albergados,
307 viviendas destruidas,
5.610 viviendas dañadas,
8 zonas sin agua potable,
4 zonas sin energía eléctrica,
5 comunas afectadas.
Una de las certezas que podemos tener al respecto es que se puede repetir.

2. Systematization
of the session

escasos recursos. Zona Precordillerana. Particularmente en el caso 
de Macul el Adulto Mayor.
-  SEGURIDAD.  Tendencia  a  saqueos  y  pillaje.  Se  configura 
escenario de disminución de condiciones de seguridad habituales, 
especialmente en las zonas de mayor impacto.
- MOVILIDAD. Afectación directa a la red vial estructurante de la 
Región  Metropolitana,  también  en  servicios  de  transporte, 
Transantiago y Metro.
-  MEDIO  AMBIENTE.  Afectación  directa  a  sistemas  sanitarios 
fundamentales,

FALTA DE AUTORIDAD ÚNICA REGIONAL CON ATRIBUCIONES MULTISECTORIALES (25,0%)
Actualmente no existe una unidad con competencias y atribuciones definidas, que bajo la dirección de 
una  única  Autoridad  Regional  tenga  la  capacidad  de  articular  los  diferentes  servicios  que  puedan 
entregar prevención y apoyo ante una catástrofe.

POCO COMPROMISO DE LAS AUTORIDADES LOCALES (12,5%)
Los  Gobiernos  Locales  han  tenido  escasa  presencia  en  las  instancias  de  debate  a  nivel  regional  
referente  a  los  riesgo  hidrometeorológicos,  ya  sea  para  exponer  sus  problemáticas  comunales  ante

FALTA DE PLANIFICACIÓN TERRITORIAL CON VARIABLE RIESGO (26%)

ASENTAMIENTOS URBANOS EN CAUCES Y QUEBRADAS  (53,85%) 
Desarrollo  de  proyectos  inmobiliarios  y  toma  de  terrenos  informales  en  zonas  de  riesgo  de 
inundaciones y aluviones. 

USO DE INFORMACIÓN DESACTUALIZADA  (38,46%)
La  información  que  es  utilizada  en  la  planificación  territorial  es  en  base  a  estadísticas  de  hechos 
ocurridos  en  el  pasado  que  no  se  condicen  con  la  realidad  medio  ambiental  asociada  al  cambio 
climático traducido por ejemplo,  en eventos hidrometeorológicos de menor frecuencia pero de mayor 
intensidad.  

MAL APROVECHAMIENTO DE LA GEOMORFOLOGÍA  (7,69%) 
Las pendientes y quebradas de la Región Metropolitana conforman activos que podrían ser usados en 
el drenaje e infiltración.

10. Metropolitan governance report The strategic partner of Santiago, ARUP, 
prepared a report on comparative governance systems, with successful cases 
from other metropolitan cities, along with an in in-depth document on Metropolitan 
Governance. A specific governance workshop was also organized with the Private-
Public Resilience Council.
