RESILIENT TULSAWELCOME 
LETTERS

G.T. BYNUM,
MAYOR OF 
TULSA

FELLOW TULSANS:

Throughout our history, our city has been built 
by pioneers. Tulsa was founded by Muscogee 
Creek Indians who did not allow the Trail of 
Tears to extinguish their spirit. It was grown 
by wildcatters and aviators of all races and 
backgrounds who came here with nothing, made 
fortunes, and built the city of their dreams. And 
today, a new generation of diverse entrepreneurs 
are building a globally-competitive 21st Century 
city. At each stage of our history, Tulsans have 
recognized the contributions of those who came 
before us and the obligation we have to leave 
things better than we found them.

For this generation of Tulsans, the great moral 
issue we face is in resolving the racial disparities 
that have been allowed to persist in our city for 
far too long. In 1921, Tulsa was the site of the 
largest race massacre in United States history. 
Hundreds of Black Tulsans were killed and 
businesses were destroyed in Tulsa’s Greenwood 
District – a place known around America at that 
time as Black Wall Street.

Today, a child born in the most predominantly 
Black part of our city has a life expectancy that 
is 11 years shorter than a child born elsewhere 
in Tulsa. We have an obligation to address 
this inequity: every child, every family, and 
every individual in Tulsa should have equal and 
equitable opportunities. Their ZIP code should not 
determine their life’s path. This is the charge of 
Resilient Tulsa. 

While racial equity is the city’s core underlying 
resilience challenge, this document also addresses 
other critical resilience challenges, ranging from 
economic inequality to disaster preparedness to 
access to quality education. 

 Over the course of several months, Chief 
Resilience Officer DeVon Douglass and her 
team have crafted Resilient Tulsa – a document 
with meaningful, measurable actions for our 
community. I am thankful for DeVon’s work, 
and to The Rockefeller Foundation and 100 
Resilient Cities for their continued guidance and 
partnership during this process. Resilient Tulsa is a 
guide for the community – including the public, 
private, philanthropic, and nonprofit sectors. It 
brings together a variety of partners, drawing on 
previously existing and new partnerships to make 
impactful change in our city.

When I took office I immediately began working 
with Tulsans across the city, regardless of 
political affiliation, to promote unity and create 
a world-class Tulsa for all. The development of 
a world-class Tulsa is not possible if all Tulsans 
cannot participate in, or do not receive, the 
benefits of living here. Resilient Tulsa helps 
address underlying issues by working to create 
equity in an actionable, measurable manner. I 
have said before that data can drive creative 
problem solving, and I am pleased that this 
document addresses equity while measuring 
the impact of its actions. Through Resilient 
Tulsa, we will be able to break down silos 
within government and the city; the process 
of developing this strategy has already begun 
to bring all sectors together to improve our 
community.

As a fifth-generation Tulsan, I am proud to live 
and raise my kids here. I grew up in a family 
that values service, and that believes serving as 
your Mayor is the greatest honor one can have 
in elected public service. I am thankful my fellow 
Tulsans have entrusted me with this office, 
and I will use my time in office to address the 
greatest challenges our city faces. You will find 
that Resilient Tulsa provides actions to build 
more equity for all Tulsans, for there is no better 
way to serve Tulsa than to put forth actions that 
benefit everyone in our city.  

Please join us as we unite behind these solutions 
that will build a world-class city for all.

Best regards,

G.T. Bynum
Mayor of Tulsa

During our conversations I heard something in 
your voices: hope. There is a hope in Tulsa, and 
it is catching. It is because of this hope that we 
can mobilize individuals from our community, 
nonprofits, businesses, philanthropies, and local 
government. This hope pushes us to build on 
work that our ancestors have done before. It is 
because of this hope that we were able to create 
such a comprehensive strategy. It is because of 
this hope that we will leverage collaboration and 
partnerships to successfully implement Resilient 
Tulsa.

I look forward to being a part of the progress 
Resilient Tulsa aims to make within the city. This 
Strategy reflects the issues that you have raised, 
and I want to hear from you and partner with you 
as we work to address them and build a more 
resilient city. Your input and voices matter to me 
and to the future of Tulsa!

DEVON A. 
DOUGLASS,
CHIEF 
RESILIENCE 
OFFICER

WELCOME!

I am proud to present Resilient Tulsa, an equitable, 
action-oriented, and collaborative strategy 
developed over the course of the last year, in 
conjunction with community partners, for the 
community of Tulsa. This strategy is not a plan 
for the City of Tulsa government, but rather 
a roadmap for all of Tulsa -- so our city can 
become a center of opportunity for all, regardless 
of race, gender, ability, education, or past.

Tulsans are no strangers to community shocks 
and stresses. From extreme weather events, to 
significant racial, economic, and health inequities, 
Tulsans have experienced it all. Resilient Tulsa 
aims to address the root causes of underlying 
inequities and better position Tulsa for a thriving 
and diverse future, regardless of future challenges 
that the city may face.

The Visions, Goals, and Actions outlined in 
Resilient Tulsa highlight opportunities to channel 
Tulsa’s historic assets and current growth towards 
a more equitable and resilient future. The Goals 
and Actions build on one another, supporting 
all Tulsans to meet their basic needs, provide a 
sense of belonging, and create an environment 
where they can achieve their personal aspirations.

Resilient Tulsa is an expansive document. It 
includes not just good ideas, but actions that 
are both new and already developed. To ensure 
we are meeting needs and making progress, my 
office will provide annual updates and make 
necessary amendments every two years.

I am thankful for the privilege of working with 
many different members of the Tulsa community 
to develop Resilient Tulsa over the past year.

RESILIENT TULSAWELCOME  
LETTERS

MICHAEL 
BERKOWITZ,
PRESIDENT, 
100 RESILIENT CITIES

CONGRATULATIONS, 

on behalf of the entire 100 Resilient Cities team, 
to Mayor Bynum and the City of Tulsa on the 
release of Resilient Tulsa. This Strategy is a major 
milestone for the City and for our partnership, 
offering a bold vision of urban resilience that 
rests upon racial equity.
 
Once a hub for the American oil industry, in 
recent years Tulsa has, with support from 
urban revitalization planning and a generous 
philanthropic community, evolved into a diverse 
and vibrant city. In Resilient Tulsa we see not 
only a celebration of that diversity, but more 
importantly the blueprint for overcoming 
long-standing racial and ethnic disparities. 
Indicators show that Tulsa’s growth has not 
equally benefited all citizens, and I commend 
this Strategy’s attention to those Tulsans most 
vulnerable to shocks and stresses that are 
economic, social, environmental, and political in 
nature.
 
Resilient Tulsa is about the people who call Tulsa 
home: ensuring their future is full of potential 
and that their local government serves them well. 
The 41 actionable initiatives contained within 
this document are focused on building cohesive 
communities. Disaster preparedness is of course 
critical for a city located in “Tornado Alley” 
– yet you will see in the following pages that 
developing local Resilience Hubs and mobilizing 
small business owners are as important as 
creating a citywide emergency mobility plan. 
And while Tulsa manages its floodplains well, 
approximately 20 percent of Tulsans live in 
distinctly arid environments known as food 
deserts. In transforming these areas characterized 

by both low fresh food access and low incomes, 
a healthy food environment taskforce and 
incentives for grocery store expansion represent 
a clear path forward for improving health 
outcomes and economic activity in North Tulsa 
and beyond. Perhaps most impressive, however, 
are the numerous actions in this Strategy that 
address systemic racial inequalities. Resilient Tulsa 
is determined to disrupt the school-to-prison 
pipeline, improve policing and criminal justice 
practices, and substantially grow and elevate 
opportunities for adjudicated Tulsans.
 
Such innovative ideas would not be possible 
without Mayor Bynum’s appointment of Tulsa’s 
Chief Resilience Officer, DeVon Douglass. CRO 
Douglass led the strategy process and her tireless 
work was guided by engagement with over 1,400 
stakeholders across the city, representing city 
and regional government, the private sector, 
faith-based organizations, philanthropy, and 
local nonprofits, among others. She furthermore 
took great initiative in convening a Racial Equity 
Advisory Group to more thoroughly respond to 
the nuanced needs of diverse communities in 
Tulsa. In parallel with the Strategy development, 
CRO Douglass advanced a partnership with the 
CUNY Institute for State & Local Governance 
and the Community Service Council to design 
an equality indicator framework for measuring 
Tulsa’s progress towards achieving greater 
equality over time. Through this work, and under 
the vision of Mayor Bynum, the city is well poised 
to confront some of its most intractable resilience 
challenges.
 
This Strategy is an extraordinary achievement 
but, in many ways, the hard work is just 
beginning. Transformative in spirit, the Actions 
within this Strategy require great commitment 
to bring them to life. We are thrilled to be a 
resource and partner as Tulsa continues on its 
resilience journey through implementation of 
Resilient Tulsa.

Sincerely,

Michael Berkowitz
President, 100 Resilient Cities

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

EXECUTIVE  
SUMMARY

The City of Tulsa was founded on hope and an entrepreneurial spirit. 
Once deemed the “Oil Capital of the World,” families flocked to the city in 
the early 20th century in search of economic prosperity and the quality of 
life that it brought. Now, the city is home to more than 400,000 Tulsans of 
all backgrounds who have contributed to its tremendous economic growth 
over the past century. These strong social connections and economic 
opportunities serve as the cornerstones for Tulsa today.
 
We are dedicated to further shaping Tulsa into a world-class city. In 
recent years, the local government has launched numerous campaigns to 
achieve this aspiration, including: the City’s largest economic development 
capital improvements program, Vision Tulsa; the first immigrant community 
inclusion plan, the New Tulsans Initiative; and the Office of Performance 
Strategy and Innovation, a City Department that aims to deliver better 
services and drive transparent decision-making. In addition to an innovative 
local government, Tulsa boasts a robust and energized philanthropic 
community that is devoted to the city and its residents. This demonstrated 
financial investment and social commitment reflects the overall sentiments 
of the city’s residents. Yet, while Tulsa’s growth has benefitted many 
citizens, not all Tulsans have experienced this elevated prosperity.
 
Building a more resilient Tulsa begins by confronting historic 
discrimination and inequality. As the site of the largest race-based 
massacre in American history, Tulsa has been shaped by its complicated 
history of racial tension. Other vulnerable populations, such as immigrants 
and Tulsans who have been involved with the criminal justice system, also 
face similar barriers today. Toward this end, Resilient Tulsa is the result 
of the work of over 2,000 individuals of all backgrounds, providing a 
robust image of the city’s diversity of experiences. These collaborations 
and proactive partnerships, including, for example, Tulsa’s Racial Equity 
Advisory Committee, were vital in creating equitable goals and actions that 
are both aspirational and achievable.
 

RESILIENT TULSA

Our Strategy is guided by four long-term Visions for Tulsa that reflect residents’ 
and stakeholders’ holistic plan for the city, each of which can be realized by the 
set of 11 Goals and 41 Actions throughout the Strategy:

VISION 01:  
CREATE AN INCLUSIVE FUTURE THAT HONORS ALL 
TULSANS
Confronting the past is the only way to foster stronger 
social bonds for the future of Tulsa. The city must celebrate 
cultural diversity and reverse the negative outcomes that have 
resulted from systemic discrimination.
 
VISION 02:  
EQUIP ALL TULSANS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS AND 
THRIVE
All Tulsans should have the ability to flourish, regardless of 
their race, ethnicity, neighborhood, health, income, gender, 
or criminal history. The city must ensure equal access to 
opportunities for residents of all backgrounds.
 
VISION 03:  
ADVANCE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL TULSANS
Not all Tulsans have the necessary tools to secure and 
maintain gainful employment irrespective of changes in labor 
demands. The city must work to eliminate the economic 
barriers that hinder some residents’ ability to achieve long-
term financial stability and prosperity.
 
VISION 04:  
TRANSFORM CITY AND REGIONAL SYSTEMS TO 
IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR ALL TULSANS
As the city grows and changes, so do its residents’ needs. The 
city must model and advocate for local and regional systems 
that accurately identify and effectively address community 
needs on a day-to-day basis. 

 
Every Tulsan plays a critical role in realizing our city’s more resilient future.  
Resilient Tulsa will serve as the guidebook and cohesive vision to unite Tulsans. Through 
collaboration and a shared commitment, Tulsa can take its rightful place as a world-class city 
for all people. Please visit https://www.facebook.com/ResilientTulsa/ and

100RC  
OVERVIEW

100 Resilient Cities—Pioneered by The 
Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) helps 
cities around the world become more 
resilient to the physical, social, and 
economic challenges that are a growing 
part of the 21st century. 100RC provides 
this assistance through: funding for a 
Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) in each 
member city who will lead the resilience 
efforts; resources for drafting a resilience 
strategy; access to private sector, public 
sector, academic, and NGO resilience tools; 
and membership in a global network of 
peer cities to share best practices and 
challenges.

Tulsa joined the 100RC network as part of 
the second wave of cities selected in 2014, 
and through its participation, is committed 
to demonstrating global leadership 
in resilience and taking advantage of 
membership resources and opportunities.

100RC supports the adoption and 
incorporation of a view of resilience that 
includes not just shocks – such as floods, 
infrastructure failure, and other acute 
events – but also stresses that weaken the 
fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical 
basis, such as economic hardship or social 
inequality. By addressing both shocks 
and stresses in a holistic manner, a city 
becomes more able to respond to adverse 
events and is better able to deliver basic 
functions in both good times and bad.

WHAT IS URBAN 
RESILIENCE?

Urban resilience is the capacity of individuals, 
communities, institutions, businesses, and 
systems within a city to survive, adapt, and thrive 
no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and 
acute shocks they experience.

RESILIENT CITIES DEMONSTRATE SEVEN 
QUALITIES:  
 

Reflectiveness and resourcefulness are 
about the ability to learn from the past 
and act in times of crisis. Individuals and 
institutions that are reflective use past 
experience to inform future decisions, 
and will modify standards and behaviors 
accordingly.  
 
Resourceful people and institutions are 
able to recognize alternative ways to use 
resources at times of crisis in order to 
meet their needs or achieve their goals.

Robustness, redundancy, and flexibility 
are qualities that help to conceive systems 
and assets that can withstand shocks and 
stresses as well as the willingness to use 
alternative strategies to facilitate rapid 
recovery. Robust design is well-conceived, 
constructed, and managed and includes 
making provisions to ensure failure is 
predictable, safe, and not disproportionate 
to the cause. For example, protective 
infrastructure that is robust will not fail 
catastrophically when design thresholds 
are exceeded.

THE RESILIENCE 
DIVIDEND

By investing in resilience-building actions 
and initiatives, cities stand to reduce 
the impact of acute shocks and chronic 
stresses – including those which cannot 
easily be predicted today. As cities continue 
to invest in resilience and implement 
integrated resilience-building actions, they 
will improve outcomes for individuals, the 
physical environment, and the economy for 
future residents to enjoy.

Building resilience starts by identifying our 
most important problems first and figuring 
out the best ways to tackle them together. 
For example, solutions that make healthcare 
more accessible can also keep our communities 
safer from crime and better prepared to handle 
emergencies. By considering how one policy 
can benefit the most people, resilience helps 
everyone in the city, not just the wealthy and 
powerful, and ensures our city grows stronger, 
not just bigger.

Redundancy refers to spare capacity 
purposively created to accommodate 
disruption due to extreme pressures, 
surges in demand, or an external event. 
It includes diversity where there are 
multiple ways to achieve a given need. For 
example, energy systems that incorporate 
redundancy provide multiple delivery 
pathways that can accommodate surges in 
demand or disruption to supply networks.
 
Flexibility refers to the willingness and 
ability to adopt alternative strategies 
in response to changing circumstances 
or sudden crises. Systems can be made 
more flexible through introducing new 
technologies or knowledge, including 
recognizing traditional practices.

Inclusive and integrated relate to 
the processes of good governance 
and effective leadership that ensure 
investments and actions are appropriate, 
address the needs of the most vulnerable, 
and collectively create a resilient city – for 
everyone. Inclusive processes emphasize 
the need for broad consultation and ‘many 
seats at the table’ to create a sense of 
shared ownership or a joint vision to build 
city resilience. 

Integrated processes bring together 
systems and institutions and can also 
catalyze additional benefits as resources 
are shared and actors are enabled to 
work together to achieve greater ends. 
For example, integrated city plans enable 
a city to deal with multidisciplinary 
issues like climate change, disaster risk 
reduction, and emergency response 
through coordination.

RESILIENT TULSATHE
OPPORTUNITY

RESILIENT TULSA:
THE OPPORTUNITY

The City of Tulsa has experienced tremendous 
economic growth over the past century. For 
many years, Tulsa was known as an oil capital, 
and through this industry many residents 
accumulated wealth that now funds many of the 
philanthropies and nonprofit organizations that 
have brought Tulsa renown as one of the most 
giving communities in the nation. Yet, while 
Tulsa’s growth has benefitted many citizens, 
not all Tulsans have experienced this increased 
prosperity.

This is due, in part, to Tulsa’s checkered history, 
one filled with both successes and failures, as 
well as prosperity and inequity. With the oil 
boom, Tulsa became a cosmopolitan town and 
a musical hub, complete with iconic art deco 
architecture and the most comprehensive art 
and artifact collection in the American West. But 
Tulsa was also shaped by a brutal race-based 
massacre of Black Tulsans in 1921. Over the 
decades, these historical wounds have festered, 
breeding persistent inequality—which can be 
measured in disparate outcomes across health, 
education, economic opportunity, and other 
metrics—that has become Tulsa’s existential 
resilience challenge. One stark manifestation 
of this legacy today is the 11-year gap in life 
expectancy that separates predominantly White 
South Tulsa from predominantly Black North 
Tulsa. In order to move forward as a vibrant 
city that can weather current and future shocks 
and stresses, Tulsa must confront this complex 
past through specific, measurable actions that 
promote equity, so all residents can benefit from 
Tulsa’s continued growth.    

Largely due to this history, racial equality and our 
other core resilience challenges are inextricably 
linked. Moreover, to be effective, we cannot 
tackle these issues in isolation: we must advance 
integrated solutions that address multiple related 
challenges. For example, we cannot adequately 
address education inadequacies without first 
addressing the school-to-prison pipeline. We 
cannot successfully tackle housing affordability 
without first addressing historic redlining and 

the divisive placement of highways. We cannot 
prepare Tulsans to weather natural disasters such 
as tornadoes and storms without confronting how 
vulnerable communities with fewer resources are 
disproportionately affected by these events. And 
we cannot close the life expectancy gap between 
North and South Tulsans without simultaneously 
addressing access to transportation, equal pay, 
and access to preventative care for Tulsans of 
color. 

While confronting and discussing historic racism 
is difficult, we believe that the Actions outlined 
in this Strategy will spur a much-needed open 
and honest dialogue among all Tulsans. Through 
an explicit focus on advancing racial equity, 
we aspire to create a city where race no longer 
determines Tulsans’ life outcomes. Moreover, 
by directly addressing racial inequity, we aim to 
improve life outcomes for all Tulsans, regardless 
of their race.1

Resilient Tulsa provides an actionable roadmap 
to achieve this vision for a more equitable 
and resilient city. Inclusivity is the core of this 
Strategy, and actions presented in Resilient Tulsa 
are meaningful and measurable. The Strategy 
includes specific actions that the City and 
partners will implement, in collaboration with the 
community, to reduce inequity and thereby make 
Tulsa more resilient.  

Resilient Tulsa is not just a Strategy for the City 
of Tulsa’s government: it was created for and 
by all Tulsans. To achieve the Visions outlined 
in this Strategy, we will rely upon collaborative 
partnerships among the local government, 
community members, businesses, nonprofits, 
philanthropy, the faith community, and national 
and international partners. These partnerships 
will be critical as we all work together to develop 
and implement innovative programs and policies 
that will complete Tulsa’s transformation into 
a truly world-class city: a city where all Tulsans 
experience the benefits of equity and resilience.

DEVELOPING
RESILIENT 
TULSA

DEVELOPING 
RESILIENT TULSA

Tulsa’s CRO, DeVon Douglass, has worked with 
community stakeholders across government, 
philanthropy, non-profit organizations, and the 
private sector since December 2016 to develop 
Resilient Tulsa.
 
The CRO partnered with several advisory groups 
that played a critical role in the creation of 
the Strategy. A Steering Committee, which 
included 14 community leaders from a variety 
of backgrounds, met regularly to shape the 
initiatives in the Strategy, provide feedback, 
and facilitate community partnerships that 
will drive implementation. In addition, a Racial 
Equity Advisory Committee that included more 
than 23 community leaders from a diverse array 
of backgrounds met regularly to collaborate 
in Strategy development and advance its 
overarching goal of promoting racial equity.
 
Development of Resilient Tulsa kicked off with 
an Agenda Setting Workshop at the Helmerich 
Center for American Research at the Gilcrease 
Museum in September 2015. This workshop 
engaged 57 Tulsans from various backgrounds 
and began the process of connecting stakeholders 
and identifying priority resilience challenges, 
including education quality, social cohesion and 
inequity, and shifting macroeconomic trends.
 
The City then conducted extensive quantitative 
and qualitative analysis of Tulsa’s city context, 
collected community perceptions of resilience, 
and researched existing efforts in Tulsa that 
already contribute to the city’s resilience. 
Tulsa’s CRO worked with more than 1,400 
stakeholders, including representatives from 
City and regional government, local nonprofits, 
the private sector, faith-based organizations, 
academic institutions, philanthropic groups, and 
residents to identify priority areas that Tulsans 
agreed need to be addressed in order to build 
the city’s resilience. These engagements took 
place in a variety of settings, which included 
interviews, small focus groups, public forums 
such as “Not Your Uncle’s Forum: An Interactive 
Conversation about Resilience.” Regardless of the 

context, Tulsans of diverse economic, social, and 
geographic backgrounds shared strikingly similar 
perspectives about our city, identifying common 
themes. This work resulted in Tulsa’s Preliminary 
Resilience Assessment (PRA), which leveraged 
the collective feedback to designate the city’s 
baseline resilience strengths to build upon — 
which include a strong philanthropic community, 
universal pre-Kindergarten, and a comprehensive 
flood plan — as well as areas for improvement 
— which include health disparities, challenges 
related to the criminal justice system, education 
funding, and natural disasters. 
 
Building upon this work, the CRO led four 
interdisciplinary working groups to build upon the 
city’s strengths and further explore priority areas 
identified in the PRA. These working groups, 
led by future implementation partners, included 
Healthy Communities, Responsive and Effective 
Governance, World Class Tulsa, and Racial Equity 
and Opportunity. The working groups, which 
included 123 experts and stakeholders from 
across a wide variety of backgrounds, researched 
opportunities and best practices through surveys 
and focus groups that reached more than 800 
Tulsans. Each group then developed clear, 
actionable initiatives that best articulate Tulsans’ 
aspirations for their city, forming the backbone 
of the Visions, Goals, and Actions that make up 
Resilient Tulsa.
 
To achieve the Goals outlined in this Strategy, 
responsibility for implementation must be 
shared by all Tulsans, including City government, 
community partners, and individual residents. 
Many key implementation partners were 
involved in the working groups to ensure a 
smooth transition in executing Resilient Tulsa. 
Furthermore, to ensure our Strategy adapts as 
our city evolves, we will continue to update the 
Strategy as needed to align priorities. To that 
end, the Mayor’s Office of Resilience and Equity 
has committed to providing annual updates on 
progress, along with necessary amendments 
every two years.

TULSA’S 
RESILIENCE 
CHALLENGES

In December 2016, Mayor Bynum and the City Council adopted a new vision 
statement for Tulsa: to build a globally competitive, world-class city.2 Since 
then, the City has launched numerous initiatives to achieve this aspiration, 
including: the City’s largest economic development capital improvements 
program, Vision Tulsa; the first immigrant community inclusion plan, 
the New Tulsans Initiative; and the Office of Performance Strategy and 
Innovation, a City Department that aims to deliver better services and drive 
transparent decision-making.3 

In addition to an innovative local government, Tulsa boasts a robust and 
energized philanthropic community. Tulsa is consistently ranked among 
the top ten most generous cities in the country and is home to the highest 
per capita giving ZIP code in the nation. Tulsa Community Foundation 
is the second largest in the nation, with more than 4.1 billion dollars in 
assets. This community provides critical support to vulnerable communities, 
particularly in areas such as health and education, and also works to 
promote inclusive long-term prosperity. In 2014, for example, the George 
Kaiser Family Foundation broke ground on A Gathering Place for Tulsa, 
nearly 100 acres of waterfront park space along the Arkansas River. The 
$400 million park was funded by nearly 70 corporate and philanthropic 
donors, constituting the largest private gift to a public park in US history.4 
Philanthropic initiatives such as these demonstrate the strong commitment 
of local organizations to Tulsa’s future.

While this is an exciting moment, Tulsa is at a crossroads: to achieve 
its full potential on the national and international stage, Tulsa must 
first address several critical challenges. A history of discrimination and 
racial tension persists, along with dramatic disparities along racial lines in 
economic and health indicators. Tulsa remains dependent on traditional 
industries, such as oil, gas, and manufacturing, as economic anchors, 
hindering the city’s ability to weather economic downturns and remain 
competitive with other cities. The city’s central location presents significant 
transportation and distribution opportunities, but also leaves the city 
vulnerable to natural disasters, notably tornados. Furthermore, the city is 
limited in its ability to prepare for these imminent challenges and disasters 
because of restrictive State policies. To become a world-class city, we must 
address Tulsa’s resilience challenges to position ourselves for a vibrant and 
inclusive future.

SYSTEMIC RACIAL INEQUITY 

A CITY ROOTED IN RACIAL TENSION

Tulsa has deep roots of social conflict and racial tension. Through the 
Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the U.S. government began relocating all 
the Native American tribes from their traditional land in the previously 
French-occupied region to one area, now within Oklahoma. At the time, 
this area was occupied by the Osage tribe. In 1826, after more than two 
decades of violent battles, the Osage tribes surrendered their land to the 
U.S. government. By 1839, nearly 63,000 Native Americans were displaced 
and relocated.5 The settlement of Tulsa, dominated by the Creek Nation, 
officially came into existence in 1875 and was incorporated as the City of 
Tulsa in 1898.6

Oil was discovered near Tulsa in 1901, which, with the promise of economic 
prosperity, brought further discrimination and racial tension. Companies 
built their headquarters in Tulsa, bringing a plethora of non-native workers 
and families. In 1906, the U.S. Congress merged Indian Territory with 
Oklahoma Territory, removing all protections granted in Indian Territory, 
and granted Oklahoma statehood.7 The population of Tulsa exploded from 
approximately 1,400 residents at the turn of the century to 72,000 in 
1920.8

As Tulsa gained prominence as ‘the Oil Capital of the World,’ Tulsans 
became increasingly wealthy.  In particular, the Greenwood District in North 
Tulsa thrived, becoming the most affluent of the State’s Black communities. 
Many well-known Black doctors, lawyers, and business owners lived and 
worked in the area, giving it the colloquial name “Black Wall Street.” In 
the early 1900s, Black Tulsans were victimized by the newly formed state, 
which imposed voter registration rules now commonly referred to as Jim 
Crow Laws, and City-mandated residential segregation. Tensions overflowed 
on May 31, 1921, when the Greenwood District burned to the ground at 
the hands of a White mob. Angry mobs of White people stormed the 
predominantly Black neighborhood in response to the alleged assault of a 
White 17-year old elevator operator, Sarah Page, by a Black shoe-shiner, 
19-year old Dick Rowland. The National Guard, brought in to control the 
situation, instead targeted Black victims. During the two-day massacre, 
hundreds in the Black community were wounded and murdered and 35 city 
blocks were destroyed along with 1,256 homes. This horrific event left an 
estimated 10,000 Black Tulsans homeless, caused $1.5 million worth of 
damage to real estate, and an additional $750,000 worth of damage to 
private property.9 In recent decades civic leaders have sought to heal these 
wounds. The city began to officially mark the anniversary of the massacre 
in 1996. Former Mayor Susan Savage offered a public apology in 2000 at a 
commemoration service as did the Chief of Police in 2013. Still, representing 
one of the nation’s worst acts of racial violence, the Tulsa Race Massacre of 
1921 left an emotional and political scar that lingers today.

CITY OF TULSA DEMOGRAPHICS

RECENT DIVERSIFICATION

From 2010 to 2017, state- and national-level 
population growth have outpaced that of 
the City of Tulsa, calculated at 4.6 percent, 
4.7 percent, and 2.8 percent, respectively. 
Tulsa’s population growth, comparatively 
low, has been driven by the city’s growing 
immigrant community. The foreign-born 
population, predominately from Latin America 
(60.3 percent) and Asia (26.8 percent), 
now represents nearly 10 percent of Tulsa’s 
population. The Latinx community in Tulsa 
has increased by 130 percent since 2000 and 
is expected to continue growing into the next 
decade. Although immigrants have emerged 
as the main driver of population and economic 
growth, several State and local policies have 
inhibited immigrants from feeling welcome 
and safe. To compound matters, there are few 
local support systems that help immigrants 
overcome cultural and language barriers. To 
combat this problem, the City is working 
with the New American Economy to develop 
immigrant integration policies so that new, 
foreign-born Tulsans feel welcome and can 
fully contribute economically and socially to 
their communities. 

LINGERING RACIAL SEGREGATION  
AND ISOLATION

Despite increasing population diversity, 
neighborhoods largely remain segregated 
along racial lines. The Black population is 
predominantly concentrated in North Tulsa and 
the growing Latinx population is moving to 
Northeast Tulsa near the City limits. South Tulsa 
is occupied primarily by more affluent, educated 
White residents and continues to outperform 
other areas of Tulsa in all socioeconomic factors 
– including health, educational attainment, and 
income. Because of the long standing history of 
Black Tulsans concentrated in the northern part 
of the city, “North Tulsans” is often used as a 
euphemism for “Black Tulsans.” This, however, 
could change in a few years. With lower cost 
of housing stock in North Tulsa, the growing 
Hispanic population is moving north. The 
changing demographics of Tulsa could prove to 
be a pressure point in the near future, and the 
need for affordable housing stock could be on the 
front lines of that stress.

currently live in low food access areas – 
meaning they live more than one mile from the 
nearest supermarket, super-center, or large 
grocery store.14 Furthermore, nearly 20 percent

ACCESSIBILITY

A product of 1950’s city planning, the Tulsa 
metro area is car-oriented. While the city’s 
highway design leads to short commute times 
for drivers, sprawl has led to increased difficulty 
in providing access to employment opportunities 
and basic services to residents without cars. In 
2016, the City’s budget for transportation and 
public works—which includes the City’s bus 
system, street maintenance, water and sewer, 
stormwater management, and trash—was $316 
million, representing 41 percent of the City’s 
total budget. This includes operations and 
maintenance costs of City roads, which  currently 
covers 4,400 lane miles. This leads to increases 
in fuel and resource consumption, higher living 
costs for car-dependent households, and higher 
air pollution/carbon footprint.

In 2013, the City began the Peoria Bus Rapid 
Transit project, an effort to modernize and 
streamline public transit along the key corridor of 
Peoria. Once complete, this system will increase 
access to numerous major destinations, including 
the Pearl District, BOK Center, Tulsa Tech Peoria 
Campus, Cityplex Towers, and Denver Avenue 
Station. This project will both increase efficiency 
and connectivity and also serve as a pilot 
program that could be expanded across the city.

Still, there are several key destinations across 
the Tulsa region that are not accessible 
through public transit, including major anchor 
employment centers, main parks and recreation 
areas, educational institutions, and hospitals. 
Low-income Tulsans unable to afford cars have 
limited access to healthcare as well as economic, 
cultural, and recreational opportunities due to 
limited public transit access.

Furthermore, the existing public transit schedule does not accommodate workers with non-traditional 
schedules. For example, the manufacturing industry requires a second shift of workers, who typically 
work from 4:00 p.m. to midnight, to meet customer demand, yet public transit services end after the 
peak rush hour time, around 7:00 p.m.

RESTRICTIVE STATE POLICIES

Oklahoma spends approximately 19 percent less per capita than the national average on State and 
local civic services.Since 2009, the State’s annual budget has decreased by 15.6 percent ($1.26 billion, 
adjusted for inflation).16 The limited State budget, coupled with the extensive State statutes, continue 
to plague municipalities and threaten short- and long-term success.

MUNICIPAL FUNDING CONSTRAINTS

The City provides important civil services, spread 
across a vast geographic area. But, sources 
of funding available to pay for these critical 
services are limited by State law. Oklahoma is 
the only state in the U.S. that prohibits cities 
from using property tax income on general fund 
operations. Instead, per the State’s constitution, 
property taxes are only available to cover general 
obligation bond debt or judgements entered 
against a given city. Due to these restrictive 
laws, municipalities rely on sales and related 
use taxes to support ongoing operations, which 
in Tulsa comprise 65 percent of Tulsa’s General 
Fund revenue ($170 million)17. The primary 
funding source – the sales tax – is uniquely 
susceptible to economic shifts, yet demands for 
City services often rise as revenues fall. Beyond 
the inherent difficulty of relying heavily on a 
single, volatile source of revenue to operate a 
complex municipality, the City is losing millions 
in sales tax revenue each year to State-imposed 
exemptions, internet sales, and suburban retail 
development.

SHRINKING EDUCATION FUNDING

State funding per student in Oklahoma 
has decreased more than any other state 
in the last decade – 28.2 percent since 
the FY 2008 budget.18 As a result of the 
tremendous budget cuts, Oklahoma public 
schools have faced significant challenges 
impacting education quality, including 
growing class sizes, elimination of programs 
and electives, and use of outdated textbooks 
and equipment. Now, over 20 percent of 
Oklahoma schools can only afford to have 
classes four days a week.19

Tulsa Public Schools (TPS) have been 
dramatically affected by these statewide 
policies. TPS has attempted to mitigate the 
effects of the teacher shortage through a 
partnership starting in 2009 with Teach 
for America, which hires graduating college 
students and professionals to teach for two 
years in low-income or underserved schools. 
Tulsa’s Teach for America alumni, who 
have completed the two-year commitment, 
remain as teachers in TPS between 65-70 
percent of the time, compared to Teach 
for America’s national average of 55-61 
percent.20

However, the issue is far from being 
solved. Oklahoma continues to lose 
teachers and other school staff members 
due to low salaries and challenging school 
circumstances. Oklahoma began the 2015-
2016 school year with approximately 1,000 
teacher vacancies, after eliminating 600 
positions at the end of the previous year.21 
The state’s number of emergency teaching 
certificates has skyrocketed from 32 before 
the 2011-2012 school year, to 1,674 for 
the 2017-2018 school year. The state’s 
minimum teacher salary has only minimally 
increased since 2008, making Oklahoma’s 
average annual teacher salary for 2018 
among the lowest in the nation, offering 
teachers just more than $44,000 including 
benefits.22

STATE EDUCATION FUNDING FORMULA
In Oklahoma, the State Aid Formula -- the funds 
appropriated by the legislature for education distributed 
from the State Department of Education -- are based 
on the number of children in a district and student 
characteristics. Additional points are provided to school 
districts for gifted and talented students, economically 
disadvantaged students, and rural areas needing 
additional transportation.Funding is calculated based 
on the higher number of the previous two years total 
student population. Adjustments are made for the 
amount of local taxes collected, like ad velorum property 
taxes, to equalize the amount of funding going to 
wealthier and poorer areas of the state. .23

LARGE STATE PENAL CODE AND LICENSING RESTRICTIONS

Oklahoma has the second highest incarceration 
rate in the United States, and the highest 
among Black citizens. Approximately one in 80 
Oklahomans is currently incarcerated or under 
supervision (1.25 percent).23
 
The State has criminalized more acts than 
any neighboring state, making it significantly 
more difficult to avoid a “tough on crime” 
justice system, particularly for low-income and 
marginalized populations that are historically 
overrepresented in the justice system. 
Oklahoma’s penal code contains 1,232 sections, 
which is 300 more sections than Arkansas, and 
four times larger than that of either Kansas or 
Texas.24 The State has made significant strides 
in reducing the penal code by downgrading 
some non-violent felonies to misdemeanors 
in SQ780, which reclassified drug possession 
as a misdemeanor and resulted in a decrease 
of related felony cases across the state by 26 
percent from 2016 to 2017, and SQ781, which 

reclassified certain property offenses and drug 
possession violations as misdemeanors.25 
 
Furthermore, restrictive State licensing policies 
severely hinder adjudicated individuals in reentry. 
Currently, over 900 statutes in Oklahoma State 
law bar or remove individuals from employment.26 
Even as the State has pursued criminal justice 
reform, the Legislature has created a slew of 
new criminal penalties – an average of 26 
new crimes per year between 2010 and 2015.27 
These limitations on the growing population of 
Oklahomans with a criminal record contribute to 
growing unmet workforce demand.

 IMPLICIT BIAS AND THE  
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
LAW ENFORCEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
Implicit bias refers to the stereotypes, favorable or unfavorable, that unconsciously affect our actions. 
Everyone has these unconscious perceptions from direct and indirect environmental and social 
influences.28 Given the racial context and history of social tension in Tulsa, many residents fall victim 
to unintentional discrimination. With Oklahoma having the highest overall Black incarceration rate 
in the U.S. (one in 29 Black persons has a criminal history) and the underrepresentation of the Black 
population in the police department, it is clear that implicit biases play a chronic role in affecting 
incarcerated populations in Tulsa. Unsurprisingly, this is the inverse of the White population – which 
is overrepresented in the police department and underrepresented in the incarcerated population.29

USE OF FORCE 

Tulsa, like other cities, is confronting a wave of social unrest in recent years. This lack of social 
cohesion is particularly evident when examining use of force and recent incidents of police shootings. 
Tulsa’s challenges in use of force and deadly outcomes are imperative to address when examining 
public safety and social cohesion. 

The Tulsa Police Department follows a use-of-force continuum. Outlining acceptable levels of force 
to use in different situations, the continuum moves upwards from low force to intermediate force 
and deadly force. However, the department lacks a publicly accessible de-escalation statement within 
the use of force policy to educate the public on the tactics police are trained in for avoiding excessive 
force. In recent history, every instance of a police officer’s use of deadly force was deemed within 
policy except one.

REENTRY DISCRIMINATION

Barriers to reentry employment exist across the United States. A 2012 national survey revealed that 
69 percent of employers conduct criminal background checks on all job candidates, though it is not 
required by law.30 In addition to State licensing and certification restrictions, employers are more 
hesitant to hire people who were involved with the justice system. Discrimination (implicit or explicit) 
hinders formerly incarcerated individuals from securing or even pursuing gainful employment upon 
release. This is a particularly acute challenge in Tulsa given the higher proportion of the population 
with a criminal record, compared to other cities or states.

MISALIGNED WORKFORCE HINDERS 
TRADITIONAL LEGACY INDUSTRIES

Tulsa has historically been reliant on oil and gas, aerospace, and related manufacturing 
operations for economic growth. The largest private sector employers in the region include 
American Airlines, Williams Corporation, NORDAM, Spirit Aerosystems, Aaon,  Baker Hughes, 
St. Francis Health System, and St. John Health System – all employing between 1,000 and 
5,000 people. Currently, approximately 10 percent of the city’s workforce is employed in 
manufacturing.
 
Though the economy has diversified since the 1980s, dips in oil and gas prices still take 
a significant toll on the city’s economy and overall prosperity. The region experienced 
considerable shocks with the dip in oil prices in 2016 alone, impacting the energy sector 
directly but also related manufacturing. As noted by the Tulsa Regional Chamber of Commerce, 
the cyclical nature of oil and gas and related industries has deterred other industries from 
locating in the city, thereby hindering broader diversification. Additionally, workforce 
attraction remains a challenge for existing industries, with employers across all industries 
indicating a skills gap and lack of available talent. Overall, there is still a substantial need for 
industry diversification and workforce development to meet the ongoing challenges posed by 
technological shifts across multiple industries and to support new industries.

RESILIENT TULSA

SHIFTING INDUSTRY DEMANDS

Accelerating technological change has prompted major shifts in business, 
industry, and consumer habits. Many of Tulsa’s target industries have been 
and will continue to be impacted by major shifts and shocks:

 •

 •

 •

 •

 •

The growing presence of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and drone 
technology indicates shifts in the aviation and aerospace industry as 
traditional modes of transportation and delivery become outdated;
Advanced manufacturing is seeing increasing automation that 
reduces the need for human labor and changes skill requirements for 
remaining positions;
The growing viability and consumer adoption of alternative energy 
sources, electric vehicle technology, and autonomous vehicles 
suggests that the need for traditional energy sources, on which the 
City of Tulsa was founded, is declining, threatening a critical anchor 
industry for the region;
Across the country, the highly skilled workforce is moving towards 
larger cities and metros to participate in their growing corporate and 
professional services and technology sectors, leaving smaller cities 
like Tulsa without the critical workforce to develop these emerging 
industries; and
As consumer buying habits trend towards online sales, the 
transportation, distribution, and logistics sector will require significant 
shifts and technological advances to be competitive.

These shifts are not short-lived; technological advancements, market 
demands, the allocation and availability of resources, and consumer habits 
have fundamentally changed what it means to be competitive in these key 
sectors. Industries and the Tulsa community will need to anticipate, prepare 
for, and respond to the changes more effectively to ensure economic 
security for all Tulsans.

WORKFORCE SKILLS GAP
Tulsa also lacks middle-skilled workers, especially 
in critical industries. Statewide, there are more 
than 60,000 unfilled jobs, of which nearly 
18,000 (30 percent) are in target industries, 
including aviation and aerospace, energy, 
and transportation and logistics. Currently 
unemployed Oklahomans do not possess the 
appropriate skills for the available positions.31

In Oklahoma, 57 percent of jobs require an 
education beyond high school, the majority 
of which (55 percent) require only a post-
secondary education but not a four-year degree.32 

However, only 47 percent of the workforce is 
trained beyond a high school diploma.33 Current 
statewide estimates show a 23-percentage 
point gap between the current workforce and 
the skilled workforce needed by 2025.34 While 
these are limited-scope projections, it is evident 
that the region will face significant economic 
repercussions given the probable needs of new 
jobs. With lack of employment opportunities 
as a significant driver for current residents to 
leave Tulsa, addressing the skills gap is critical 
in retaining Tulsa’s labor pool and leading the 
region.

THREAT OF NATURAL AND  
MAN-MADE DISASTERS

Since 1953, FEMA has declared over 167 disasters 
in the State of Oklahoma, making it the fifth most 
disaster-stricken state. Tulsa has experienced 32 of 
the State’s federally declared disasters. These include 
winter storms, wildfires, floods, and tornadoes.35 
Tulsa’s location within “Tornado Alley” makes the 
city vulnerable to a variety of these disasters. In 
August of 2017, Tulsa experienced an EF-2 tornado 
that injured 25 people and damaged dozens of homes 
and businesses. Additionally, earthquakes of a 3.0 
magnitude or higher have spiked in the state, from 
a few dozen in 2012 to more than 900 in 2015. The 
dramatic spike is linked to the increasing prevalence of 
oil fracking. In September 2016, the Tulsa region felt 
one of the largest earthquakes in the State’s history, a 
5.6 magnitude quake.36
 
The Hazard Vulnerability Analysis model, which ranks 
a city’s hazards based on occurrence, vulnerability, 
mitigation activities, and available resources, 
demonstrates that Tulsa is very susceptible to a wide 
array of hazards and disasters – namely, extreme 
heat, tornadoes, and winter/ice storms. As the most 
population-dense county in the state, even localized 
earthquakes within Tulsa could have large scale 
impacts.

CITY OF TULSA HAZARD VULNERABILITY MATRIX 
(AS SEEN ON THE RIGHT)

This Hazard Vulnerability Analysis model involves a 
ranking of the community’s hazards by  occurrence, 
vulnerability, mitigation activities and available 
resources. Using a scale of 0 to 5 with 5 being the 
highest, the probability of occurrence and the impact 
potential are measured against mitigation activities 
and the resources available to respond to the hazard. 
The total is based on a formula that weighs risk 
heavily but provides credit for mitigation and response 
and recovery resources. The highest score possible is 
7.8, with 6.0 and higher considered “Extreme Risk.”

RESILIENT TULSATULSA’S
EXISTING
PLANS

LEVERAGING TULSA’S 
EXISTING PLANS 

Fortunately, a wealth of existing and planned 
efforts already contribute to Tulsa’s resilience, 
and this Strategy aims to both build upon and 
shape current and future City plans. Resilient 
Tulsa has been developed in conjunction with the 
City’s New Tulsans plan, the City employee AIM 
plan, and the City’s TulStat and Gallup Poll data 
collection. Further, with the release of Resilient 
Tulsa, the City of Tulsa’s Planning Department 
will incorporate resilience principles into current 
Small Area Plans and future city planning 

AIM 
The AIM Plan is a measurable strategy illustrating 
the City of Tulsa’s priorities. The mission of the 
AIM Plan is to “build the foundation for economic 
prosperity, improved health and enhanced quality 
of life for our community” with a vision of 
making Tulsa “a globally competitive, world-class 
city.” The AIM Plan seeks to address and increase 
Tulsan’s access to opportunity, well-being, the 
city living experience, and interactions with City 
Hall. Similarly to Resilient Tulsa, the AIM Plan 
intends to improve the educational, financial, 
physical, and mental health of Tulsans, the 
physical landscape of the City and City services 
and safety, and the accessibility and customer 
experience of navigating City systems.

GO PLAN
The GO Plan is the Tulsa Regional bicycle and 
pedestrian master plan. The GO Plan provides 
a strategy for creating a more walkable and 
bicycle-friendly Tulsa that, through these 
activities, helps increase the health and 
well-being of residents as well as creating 
necessary, additional transportation options. 
The GO Plan seeks to improve overall health and 
transportation options to all Tulsans.

documents to ensure long-term resilience is 
included in all City development. The integration 
of Goals and Actions from this Strategy into the 
City of Tulsa’s strategic and planning documents 
demonstrates the City’s commitment to resilience 
and creating equity for all citizens.

Resilient Tulsa builds on the following efforts by 
applying a resilience lens to decades of planning 
and reports that have established a vision for the 
future of the city.

CONNECTIONS 2035:  
REGIONAL TRANSIT PLAN
Connections 2035 examines and makes 
recommendations for improvements and future 
projects regarding Tulsa’s roadways and transit 
systems. Connections 2035 contains a variety 
of performance measures and actions the City 
could take regarding multi-model transportation. 
It also identifies areas in need of further 
transportation access and options. Like Resilient 
Tulsa, Connections 2035 seeks to better City 
(transportation) systems to improve all Tulsans 
outcomes. 

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF 
THE TULSA COMMISSION ON COMMUNITY 
POLICING 
In January 2017 Mayor G.T. Bynum established 
a task force to determine best practices 
for implementing community policing. The 
task force included Tulsa Police Department 
leadership, the City Council, City employees, 
and community members chosen by the Mayor. 
The recommendations are guided by the 
President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, 
a product of the Barack Obama administration.  
The Commission on Community Policing 
recommended 77 strategies across six pillars.

RESILIENT TULSA

TULSA COMPREHENSIVE PLAN (PLANiTULSA)
PLANiTULSA is Tulsa’s Comprehensive plan, 
which is updated every ten years. The City of 
Tulsa views PLANiTULSA as a guiding document, 
envisioning and describing the places, economy, 
housing, parks, open spaces, and transportation 
City policies should be designed to create. 
PLANiTULSA aims to develop Tulsa in a way that 
continues to attract and retain young talent, 
new businesses, and a strong economy. Like 
Resilient Tulsa, PLANiTULSA is designed to address 
economic development and opportunity, and help 
address racial inequity by addressing accessibility 
barriers.

TULSA PARKS AND RECREATION 
 MASTER PLAN
The Tulsa Parks and Recreation Master Plan was 
designed to meet the needs of all Tulsa residents 
by strategically sustaining and improving the 
City’s parks and recreation spaces. The plan was 
designed with citizen input to ensure the strategy 
reflected the recreational and facility needs of 
the community. Tulsa Parks and Recreation 
Master Plan and Resilient Tulsa both aim to meet 
community needs.

NEW TULSANS
A strategy for welcoming immigrants to Tulsa 
and helping them integrate into the community. 
New Tulsans is a measurable strategy, meant 
to address the needs of foreign-born Tulsans 
and aid in social cohesion. Similarly to Resilient 
Tulsa, the New Tulsans strategy seeks to address 
issues of social cohesion, and honor and welcome 
Tulsans to the community.

FUTURE THAT 
HONORS ALL 
TULSANS

We envision a city where the past is 
reconciled to form a future that celebrates 
cultural heritage and eliminates systemic 
discrimination. With these Actions, the city 
will create stronger bonds and support the 
diversity that creates the fabric of Tulsa. 

Tulsa’s history of racial tension has led to inherent bias. To grow as a 
unified, strong community, the city must acknowledge the past to correct 
systemic discrimination. By facing these difficult realities head on, Tulsa can 
lead the nation in righting persistent wrongs and celebrating its diverse and 
dynamic city.

GOAL 1.1

 

STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY COHESION BY 2021 BY 

AMPLIFYING THE VOICE OF HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED 

COMMUNITIES AND CREATING PHYSICAL SPACES THAT 

PROMOTE CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE

Every community in Tulsa shaped the city’s shared history – good 
and bad. Yet persistent discrimination has left many historically 
marginalized  residents  feeling  unwelcome  in  their  own  city, 
dating as far back as the Trail of Tears in the early 19th century 
where  native  people  were  displaced  to  accommodate  White 
settlement. This expulsion laid the groundwork for the founding 
of Tulsa. With the 100th commemoration of the infamous Tulsa 
Race Massacre that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of  Black 
Tulsans  and  an  entire  neighborhood  burned  to  the  ground,  the 
city is forced to examine the systemic issues that linger into the 
21st century. Acknowledging the contribution of Black Tulsans to 
the  city’s  development  is  critical  in  creating  an  inclusive  future 
for all Tulsans. Through the Actions under this Goal, the City will 
honor historically-marginalized communities by recognizing their 
significant  contribution  to  Tulsa’s  history  and  their  continuing 

presence in Tulsa today.

to highlight Black Wall Street visibly from the 
244 highway, Oklahoma State University-Tulsa 
campus, and surrounding areas of town.  

The City of Tulsa will use capital funds to provide 
signs, monuments, and other physical markers 
to help foster placemaking and community pride. 
Black Wall Street historically was a place of 
community wealth for Tulsa’s Black community, 
but it was destroyed during the Race Massacre of 
1921. These efforts will amplify the work of the 
Race Riot Commission, the businesses currently 
in the area, and Oklahoma public schools’ 
educational curriculum that discusses the Race 
Massacre. Not only will these placemaking 
actions create physical tributes, they will also 
strengthen social cohesion by drawing attention 
to the work being done in and the stories of a 
historically marginalized community.

PARTNER SPOTLIGHT

BLACK WALL STREET 
The morning of May 31, 1921, the Greenwood area of Tulsa, 
also known as Black Wall Street, was a thriving neighborhood 
of Black wealth and contained Black businesses, stores, 
a hospital, theater, and schools. This area’s success was 
brought to an end when Black Wall Street was looted, 
damaged, and several buildings were burned to the ground 
by White Tulsans during a two-day, race-based massacre 
the evening of  May 31, 1921, and all day on June 1, 1921. 
The National Guard, brought in to control the situation, 
instead targeted Black victims. Soon after Black Wall Street’s 
destruction, the City of Tulsa’s commissioners created an 
ordinance prohibiting fire service to the Greenwood area and, 
through other policies, made rebuilding Black Wall Street 
impossible. For years Black Wall Street remained empty, but 
in the more recent years local business-men and -women 
have been working to rebuild it. These efforts have been 
further helped by the Greater Tulsa Area African American 
Affairs Commission and their focus on economic opportunity 
and business development in the Greenwood area.

SHORT-TERM;

Expand interfaith racial reconciliation dinners. 
Dinners will encourage constructive, meaningful 
conversations to bring about understanding and 
unity among Tulsans of differing backgrounds. 
Faith communities, of all varieties, have historically 
played an important role in shaping culture and 
promoting dialogue in Tulsa. 

With the Mayor’s Office of Resilience and Equity 
as the facilitator, Tulsa’s faith communities will 
participate in discussions on topics ranging from 
structural racism and interfaith relations to 
education and economic opportunities. Groups of 
8-12 people will meet at a place of worship to break 
bread and share discussion on a quarterly basis, 
beginning in September of 2018. These discussions 
will provide a place at the table for all and will be 
designed to create a snowball effect, fostering new 
relationships among diverse groups of Tulsans and 
encouraging those participating to continue the 
conversation after dinner has concluded.

HUSTLE 
Through a partnership with 100 Resilient Cities, the 
Mayor’s Office of Resilience and Equity will use Hustle, 
a scalable, peer to peer text messaging platform, to 
effectively communicate with Tulsans about race 
reconciliation conversations and other city-wide 
events. Employees at the Mayor’s Office will use 
Hustle to send reminder texts about the location and 
time to increase attendance and participation, send 
pre- and post-event surveys to measure attendee 
thoughts and understanding of race relations in Tulsa, 
and measure the success of the event. Hustle is a tool 
that will empower the Mayor’s Office to engage the 
community in an easy, accessible manner, which is 
vital to creating racial equity in Tulsa.

 PARTNER WITH TULSA’S INCREASINGLY DIVERSE 
COMMUNITIES TO SHAPE OUR SHARED IDENTITY 

THROUGH NEW PLANNING EFFORTS, CULTURAL ASSETS, 

AND NEIGHBORHOOD EVENTS BY 2020

In  recent  years,  Tulsa  has  experienced  a  substantial  increase 
in  diversity.  In  particular,  the  immigrant  community  has 
doubled in size in the last 15 years. Tulsa’s increasingly diverse 
neighborhoods  can  be  a  source  of  new  cultural  vibrancy  in  a 
city  with  limited  cultural  offerings.  Residents  responding  to  a 
Resilient  Tulsa  survey  indicated  that  the  desire  for  a  livelier 
cultural environment is one of the primary reasons why people 
would leave Tulsa. For these reasons, building a unifying cultural 
identity  is  more  important  than  ever  –  to  promote  cohesion, 
improved neighborhoods, and economic development. Through 
the Actions under this Goal, Tulsa will pilot a resilience district 
and establish programs and policies to become a more inclusive 

and committed community.

Accelerate coordinated investments to

participate in the pilot, starting with Comanche 
Park and River West, formerly known as Eugene 
Field. In collaboration with neighborhood 
communities, the City will create and implement 
a plan over the coming year and then will work 
interdepartmentally to launch additional after 
school programming, opportunities for owners 
to rehabilitate their homes, appropriately 
incentivized development, and funding 
specific to the area to meet community needs. 
Additional Healthy Places will be selected in 
partnership with the Tulsa City-County Health 
Department. Outcomes of additional resources 
and development will be measured through 
surveys and tracking of health improvements 
every 6 months to establish the impact on the 
community.

communities. The goal of 918 Day is to engage 
all Tulsans, regardless of neighborhood affiliation 
or background, in an accessible, fun, and 
convenient manner, while connecting them to 
their city and to each other. Tulsa experienced 
success with its First Friday Art Crawl, Mayfest, 
Blue Dome Festival, and other art and cultural 
festivals and events. 918 Day will build upon the 
success of these events and develop a unique 
opportunity to unify the community, increase 
hope, foster economic prosperity, and support 
youth development. 918 Day will be celebrated at 
a selected location in North, West, or East Tulsa 
on September 18th each year. The week leading 
up to September 18th will begin by celebrating 
“Welcome Week,” a special week in which Tulsa 
will bring together immigrants, refugees, and 
native-born residents to raise awareness of the 
benefits of welcoming everyone. Welcome Week 
activities leading up to 918 Day will include local 
culturally representative art and diverse culinary

SHORT-TERM;

Build a system that fosters relationship 
building between Tulsa’s growing immigrant 
community and native Tulsans. Informed by 
the New Tulsans Initiative, the City of Tulsa will 
promote a welcoming culture that eliminates 
fear amongst new immigrant Tulsans while 
strengthening ties to their new communities. 
To aid in the welcoming process, the Mayor’s 
Office of Resilience and Equity will create a 
“Welcome Portal.” The Welcome Portal will 
serve as an initial connecting point for both 
immigrant Tulsans and native Tulsans. As part 
of the Resilient Tulsa website, the Welcome 
Portal will provide a platform for immigrants 
to access resources that support their basic 
needs as well as opportunities to become more 
civically engaged and connected to the Tulsa 
community. Additionally, the Welcome Portal 
will provide resources and information for native 
Tulsans, including educators, service providers, 
and administrators, on how they can be more 
welcoming for Tulsa’s immigrant community. 
Through the Welcome Portal and New Tulsans 
Initiative, the City will ensure justice while 
fostering economic development, security, and 
social stability for all Tulsans. Welcoming and

IMMIGRATION 
PROGRAMS IN TULSA 

To  welcome  new  Tulsans,  Catholic  Charities,  the  YWCA  of  Tulsa,  a  board 
member of Tulsa Metropolitan Ministries, and the University of Tulsa College 
of Law Boesche Legal Clinic are available to provide services to clients. Catholic Charities 
and  the  YWCA  of  Tulsa  both  provide  a  myriad  of  services  to  the  community  at  large, 
and  also  have  extensive  immigration  and  refugee  services  available.  Refugee  services  at 
Catholic Charities and YWCA are comprehensive in their approach, providing legal services 
and    as  well  as  education,  language  classes,  workforce  and  HR  education,  and  financial 
classes. Catholic Charities’ and the YWCA’s intent is to provide refugees with all the skills 
needed to settle into and build a life in the Tulsa area. Similarly, Catholic Charities provides 
affordable, accessible immigration law services in English, Spanish, Burmese, Russian, and 
Arabic. The YWCA provides equitable legal services and also offers those services in Zomi. 
At the University of Tulsa College of Law, the Boesche Legal Clinic provides legal services 
through  its  Community  Advocacy  Clinic,  Immigrant  Rights  Project,  and  Tulsa  Immigrant 
Resource Network. Catholic Charities, the YWCA, and the Boesche Legal Clinic have been, 
and will continue to, working on immigration matters for year. They have become reliable, 
trustworthy entities for assistance on immigration or refugee matters. 

There  are  also  many  well-known  advocacy  groups  supporting  immigrants  in  the  Tulsa 
area. To assist with immigration advocacy Tulsa’s Dream Act Oklahoma, Hmong American 
Association, Zomi USA-Tulsa, Coalition of Hispanic organizations, Indo-American Chamber 
of  Commerce,  and  Raindrop  Turkish  House  not  only  help  with  advocacy,  but  also  create 
a  sense  of  belonging.  Dream  Act  Oklahoma  provides  immigration  education  and  informs 
immigrants  of  their  rights.  The  Coalition  of  Hispanic  Organizations  has  highly-attended 
health  fairs  to  help  immigrants  navigate  the  U.S.  healthcare  system,  and  are  open  to 
immigrants  and  native-born  Tulsans  alike.  The  Hmong  American  Association  and  Zomi-
USA Tulsa provide community, while Indo-American Chamber of Commerce uses legislative 
advocacy  to  encourage  improved  immigration  and  business  relations.  Raindrop  Turkish 
Center not only has educational programming about Turkish culture, but has intercultural 
programming  that  promotes  and  aids  in  social  cohesion.  Together  all  of  these  programs 
provide a very necessary and welcoming support system to Tulsa’s immigrant residents.

We envision a city where all residents can 
flourish, regardless of their race, ethnicity, 
residence, health, income, gender, or

Tulsans will not be barred from achieving 
success because of their background or ZIP 
code. 

Historically, discrimination – implicit and explicit – has hindered vulnerable 
populations’ ability to flourish. As a result, not all Tulsans have the same 
potential to have a fulfilling life built on a foundation of social stability, 
health and security. By eliminating existing disparities, the City can build a 
more equitable foundation to increase access to economic opportunity and 
health services while also increasing the capacity for social resilience.

GOAL 2.1

 

 BREAK THE CYCLE OF INCARCERATION AND ENSURE 

FAIR ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY FOR PREVIOUSLY 

INCARCERATED TULSANS

Adjudicated  individuals are plagued by their criminal records, 
regardless of the crime committed, the length of time passed, 
or any rehabilitation efforts undergone. In fact, approximately 
two-thirds of employers conduct criminal background checks 
on  all  of  their  job  candidates,  regardless  of  the  position. 
Tulsa is no exception. On average, annual income is reduced 
by 40 percent for those who have been incarcerated. Gainful 
employment  is  cited  as  one  of  the  most  important  factors 
for  successful  reentry  and  decreased  recidivism.  Despite  the 
numerous  organizations  that  are  supporting  adjudicated 
Tulsans and local employers that utilize fair-hiring practices, 
Tulsa’s incarceration rate outpaces that of the United States.  
Additionally  in  Tulsa,  20  percent  of  individuals  booked  into 
the  County  jail  are  readmitted  again  within  the  same  year. 
By  reducing  the  stigma  around  justice-involvement,  the 
Actions under this Goal seek to not only broaden opportunity 
for  these  individuals,  including  to  secure  and  retain  gainful 
employment, but also reduce the increasing overcrowding and 

budgetary pressures on the justice system.

SHORT-TERM;  
2019 Q1 LAUNCH 

Develop and launch a communications campaign 
highlighting the careers and accomplishments 
of Tulsans who have been involved with the 
justice system. Oklahoma has the second highest 
rate of incarceration per capita of all states 
in the nation, along with the highest female 
incarceration rate. Adjudicated individuals 
remain a widely untapped resource within the 
local labor force, as they face numerous barriers 
to employment. Yet, across Tulsa’s economy, 
positions requiring varying degrees of skill and 
experience go unfilled each day. Meanwhile, 
access to stable employment is the main way of 
preventing recidivism. Through a demystification 
campaign, the City will collaborate with second-
chance and non-profit employers to feature 
their employees and clients through the City’s 
website and social media. Through these 
personal accounts, the City of Tulsa will ensure 
that the adjudicated population is aware of the 
resources available to support them in successful 
reentry -- promoting economic vitality for all 
Tulsans -- while breaking down stereotypes and 
misperceptions. This campaign will facilitate a 
broader conversation, led by the City, around 
the challenges faced by adjudicated individuals 
to reduce the discrimination, implicit or explicit, 
faced by these people. By humanizing this 
population, feelings and acts of discrimination 
can be challenged at the citywide level.

Publicize the City of Tulsa’s implementation of 
the 2016 “Ban-the-Box” Executive Order to 
help Tulsa lead the way in second-chance hiring 
practices. In 2016, then Mayor Dewey Bartlett 
signed Executive Order (EO) 2016-4: “City of 
Tulsa and Restricting the City of Tulsa’s Inquiry 
Into an Applicant’s Criminal History for Certain 
Positions by Removing the Question From the 
Employment Application.” The EO prevents the 
City from requesting information about a City job 
applicant’s criminal history at the onset of the 
hiring process. A publicly available assessment 
of the results from the EO will solidify the City’s 
position as a leader within the community on job 
creation and workforce development. The City of 
Tulsa’s Human Resource Department classified 
job positions according to job duties and 
approximately two-thirds of the City’s positions 
have “Banned-the-Box.”

Develop publicly accessible de-escalation language 
to reduce use-of-force incidents. Building upon 
and enhancing the pre-existing use-of-force 
continuum, the Tulsa Police Department will create 
a comprehensive de-escalation policy that will train 
officers to defuse situations without using weapons 
whenever it is safe and reasonable to do so. The 
existing use-of-force continuum informs officers 
when to use low, intermediate, or great—including 
deadly—force when responding to an incident. While 
Tulsa Police Department currently trains officers 
in de-escalation, the publicly available use-of-
force policy does not include overt de-escalation 
language. Utilizing explicit de-escalation language in 
conjunction with the use of force continuum should 
decrease the number of use-of-force complaints 
and increase trust of the police among community 
members.

incarceration rate and the negative impact incarceration is having on the local economy and families, 
several organizations in the Tulsa area are providing diversion and reentry programs. 

Resonance Center for Women offers three 
types of programming to address substance 
abuse and reentry, and has a DUI school. 
Women combating substance abuse can access 
Resonance’s outpatient counseling services 
through a referral as part of diversion program, 
probation and parole, Temporary Assistance for 
Needy Families, or Child Welfare. Within the 
reentry program, called Choosing to Change, 
at Turley Residential Center, incarcerated 
women improve their workforce skills, including 
interpersonal relationships, communication, 
interview preparation, educational classes, 
and career-specific training. Participants can 
apply to Resonance’s programming at any point 
of their incarceration and, once accepted, go 
through the 12 week course concluding with a 
celebratory graduation. Graduates of Choosing 
to Change have the opportunity to apply to, 
live, and work at Resonance’s Take 2 Café. The 
Take 2 Café provides employees with sober 
housing, helps them save money, builds up their 
work experience and history, and decreases 
the likelihood of recidivism. To ensure women 
who have received a DUI or DWI can have their 
driver’s license reinstated, Resonance offers a 
DUI/DWI course and substance use assessment 
for a nominal cost. 

Women in Recovery diverts eligible women 
from incarceration who would otherwise face 
long prison sentences for drug-related offenses. 
As part of their outpatient services, Women in 
Recovery offers family reunification services, 
substance abuse services, mental health 
treatment, education, and workforce training 
and development. Women in Recovery partners 
with several second chance employers in the 
Tulsa area to place program participants in 
jobs. Some of these employers include: Webco 
Industries, Bama Co., Foam Rubber LLC, Sigma 
Stretch, HiCorp, SNG Compression, Hyatt 
Regency, DoubleTree, and the Wild Fork.  

Center for Employment Opportunities Tulsa 
(CEO) works with those who were involved in 
the justice system to provide employment. CEO 
does this through the process of providing work 
training and education, a transitional temporary 
job before moving participants into full time job 
placements, and follow-up, post-job attainment 
support. CEO works with men and women in 
all places in life, but specifically focuses on 
providing employment services to those ages 
18-25. 

Tulsa Reentry One-Stop is housed within 
the Community Services Council and provides 
workforce training and support services to 
young adults ages 18-24. Interested participants 
receive soft skills training, industry-specific job 
training, and computer education. To further 
assist participants, Tulsa Reentry One-Stop also 
provides help with housing, healthcare, and 
mental health services. 

Workforce Tulsa fuels economic development by 
connecting businesses in our region with job-
ready talent through public/private partnerships. 
Workforce Tulsa works with companies to 
determine their workforce needs, then prepares 
clients to be ready to meet those needs, via 
education and training. Clients are then placed 
into careers at family supporting wages.

with the court systems to negotiate and establish 
payment plans. Additionally, Still She Rises 
educates Tulsa-area advocates, attorneys, and 
judges on the harmful effects overcriminalization 
has on mothers and families. 

The Criminal Justice Collaborative is a 
group of various Tulsa County criminal 
justice representatives who provide different 
perspectives but are working toward the common 
goal of implementing strategies to reduce 
incarceration and involvement in the criminal 
justice system. In February of 2018, the Criminal

DECREASE THE RACIAL LIFE EXPECTANCY GAP BY 

2024 BY IMPROVING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH 

OUTCOMES FOR ALL TULSANS

The life expectancy gap between Black and White Tulsans is 
one of the most unambiguous examples of inequality in our 
city. In Tulsa, affluent White communities can live more than 
a  decade  longer  than  low-income  communities  dominated 
by  people-of-color  located  less  than  10  miles  away.  This 
life expectancy gap is the result of disparate health services 
and  inadequate  social  determinants  of  health.  Through  the 
Actions under this Goal, the City will enhance the overall well 
being of all Tulsans and address these disparities by increasing 

equitable access to health services and nutritious food.

deserts. The City will complete a retail market 
study and examine cash flow to identify areas 
that have demand for grocery stores, but are 
currently underserved. To meet the goal of the 
City of Tulsa’s Food and Hunger Task Force, the 
City plans to recruit at least two new grocery 
stores over the next eight years to help address 
food deserts. These efforts will promote improved 
health outcomes, create new jobs, support local 
entrepreneurs, and expand Tulsans’ access to 
affordable, nutritious, fresh foods.

to meet the needs of vulnerable populations and 
the LGBTQ+ community in Tulsa. In collaboration 
with local providers, medical schools, Federally 
Qualified Health Care Clinics (FQHC), free 
clinics, social service organizations, and school 
systems, identify individuals or groups in need 
of a Community Health Care Worker. Community 
Health Care Workers will receive annual cultural 
competency trainings developed in collaboration 
with the American Psychology Association, 
Tulsa Health Department, and Oxley School 
of Community Medicine with the option of 
taking part in a train-the-trainer course. The 
train-the-trainer cultural competency course 
enables Community Health Workers to complete 
additional cultural competency trainings for 
local providers, free clinics, FQHCs, social service 
organizations, school systems, and partner with 
academic institutions and local medical schools 
to provide trainings to future doctors and nurses. 
Implementing cultural competency trainings and 
expanding the community health care worker 
model will improve Tulsans’ health as it will make 
the health care experience more welcoming and 
informative. It will also increase the access to and 
frequency with which vulnerable populations and 
LGBTQ+ Tulsans seek medical care.

HEALTH PROGRAMS 
ADDRESSING THE LIFE 
EXPECTANCY GAP 

In the City of Tulsa there is an 11 
year life expectancy gap between 

residents in the 74126 and 74137 zip codes. 
This current life expectancy gap is actually an 
improvement as the baseline measurement 
taken from 2000-2002 showed a 14 year life 
expectancy gap. During that time span there 
were several health initiatives developed to 
narrow the life expectancy gap, including the 
construction of the Tulsa Health Department’s 
North Regional Health and Wellness Center, 
the OU Wayman Tisdale Specialty Health Care 
facility, and the Morton Comprehensive Health 
Services clinic, as well as stabilizing the OSU 
teaching hospital in downtown Tulsa. The 
expansion and addition of these programs have 
contributed to increasing access to health care 
for vulnerable populations. 

One of the most successful initiatives in 
narrowing the life expectancy gap was the 
Heart Intervention Program, sponsored by the 
George Kaiser Family Foundation. Through this 
program, high-risk Tulsans in North Tulsa had 
increased access to free of charge aspirin, blood 
pressure medication, and cholesterol-reducing 
medication. Local public health statistics 
showed that this program helped reduce the 
chance of death by 75 percent. 

The Tulsa City-County Health Department 
has continued building and expanding 
programming to address access to care issues 
and social determinants of health. The Health 
Department has developed a Community Health 
Improvement Plan (CHIP), which addresses 
health access and education. The CHIP 
covers issues of housing and transportation, 
educational attainment, healthcare, health 
systems literacy, access to nutritious food, and 

nutrition education. The Health Department 
has and is continuing to develop programming 
in many of these areas. From community 
gardens on its North Tulsa campus, to cooking 
classes, to examining school health, to housing 
inspections and property maintenance, the 
Health Department is actively working to close 
the life expectancy gap. 

It takes more than one entity to close an 11 
year life expectancy gap. There are several 
excellent and accessible clinics and agencies in 
Tulsa working on this matter, and an agency 
called MyHealth Access Network will further 
help with data collection and collaboration 
amongst those working on improving Tulsans’ 
health. MyHealth Access Network’s Oklahoma’s 
Route 66 AHC program will screen more than 
75,000 Oklahomans each year for social needs 
in five key areas that can lead to poor health 
outcomes: housing insecurity, food insecurity, 
utility assistance, interpersonal violence, and 
transportation. Patients seeking medical care 
will be asked questions related to these five 
core human needs and, if necessary, connected 
with community social service “navigators,” a 
new role in the Health Department funded by 
the AHC grant. The navigators will work with 
the patients and their families to evaluate 
their needs and help them select the best 
organizations to improve their situation. 
MyHealth Access Network serves as the 
project’s bridging organization, connecting and 
coordinating all of the moving parts of the 
program. In addition, MyHealth Access Network 
is providing the technology to connect and 
securely exchange data and enable electronic 
referrals to social service agencies and other 
providers when needed.

WEATHER ADVERSE EVENTS

Over  the  past  50  years,  Tulsa  has  experienced  over  1,900 
emergencies, ranging from drought and tornadoes to severe 
winter  storms  and  pollution.  The  array  of  natural  disasters 
creates  an  additional  challenge  for  emergency  preparation. 
These  adverse  events  disproportionately  affect  socially- 
and  economically-vulnerable  populations.  Through  the 
Actions under this Goal, comprehensive planning efforts and

Tulsans to endure natural and man-made disasters.

neighborhoods. The City of Tulsa will develop 
Resilience Hubs in the Comanche Park and 
River West, formerly known as Eugene Field, 
neighborhoods through the implementation of 
the “Map Your Neighborhood” program. Map 
Your Neighborhood helps neighbors develop 
disaster preparedness through a step-by-step 
process. Through a series of meetings and 
trainings, neighborhood residents will be made 
aware of nearby risks, who their neighbors are, 
and nearby resources. Neighbors will not only 
be prepared to respond during emergencies and 
disasters, but they will also reconnect during the 
preparation process.  

PARTNER SPOTLIGHT
UP WITH TREES PROGRAMMING
Up With Trees’ mission is beautifying Tulsa by planting trees 
to create urban forestry awareness through education. As part 
of this mission, Up With Trees is helping enhance the Osage 
Prairie Trail and is providing its youth education program, 
Tree School, to all Tulsa Public Schools. 

The Osage Prairie Trail project involves 151 days of clean 
up and the planting of 850 trees. This includes the planting 
of food forests, as well as planting trees for stormwater 
mitigation and to shade the trail.

While the Osage Trail project will likely be complete by fall of 
2018, over the next 3 years, Up With Trees will implement Tree 
School at 65 schools within the Tulsa Public School system. 
Tree School will allow students to engage in environmental 
science lessons and  be involved in planting trees at their 
school to achieve a minimum of 10 percent tree canopy on 
each campus.

We envision a city where all Tulsans are

Faced with disruptive technologies, the longevity of traditional industries 
– particularly energy, aviation, manufacturing, and transportation and 
distribution – is at risk, as is the economic stability of the region. As 
these anchor industries undergo significant shifts, so too does traditional 
workforce demand; disproportionate impact can be expected for Tulsa’s 
socially and economically vulnerable populations. In this new era, the region 
must turn to evolving industries to diversify its economic base and prepare 
the local workforce to fill emerging employment gaps.

A  student’s  experience  with  quality  teachers  leads  to  better 
outcomes,  yet  funding  for  education  has  been  progressively 
cut at the state level. As a result of declining quality education 
outcomes and unpreparedness for post-secondary education, 
the long-term fiscal health of Tulsa’s workforce is threatened. 
Through  the  Actions  under  this  Goal,  students  will  receive

MID-TERM;  
2019 Q1 LAUNCH

Support and empower Bank$afe Oklahoma to 
reach  unbanked and underbanked Tulsans, 
eliminate the racial wealth gap, and ensure 
that all Tulsans can reach self-sufficiency. 
The Alliance for Economic Inclusion launched 
Bank$afe Oklahoma in 2017 to bolster access 
to safe transaction accounts. Coupled with the 
Bank-On Coalition, this effort will promote 
financial literacy for adults through accessible 
financial literacy education and by connecting 
Tulsans to affordable banking options. The City 
of Tulsa will support expansion of these efforts 
by helping connect local partners with Bank$afe 
Oklahoma to  promote financial literacy, as well 
as educate Tulsans about safe and appropriate 
banking products that can help them build 
their assets and foster economic mobility for 
low-income Tulsans. This effort will also help 
educate Tulsans about the dangers of alternative 
financial products, such as payday lenders, 
that can hinder efforts to build savings.  The 
Mayor’s Office of Resilience and Equity will work 
with local organizations to provide accessible 
education opportunities and local interpreters so 
information is conveyed in numerous languages, 
such as Hindi, Hmong, Korean, Russian, Spanish, 
and Vietnamese, to meet the needs of the 
growing immigrant community.

GOAL 3.2

 

DEVELOP LOCAL-TALENT CAPACITY FOR  

JOBS OF THE FUTURE

As industry demands shift, the region’s labor pool and their 
skillset  must  adaptto  ensure  there  is  adequate  supply.  The 
emerging  industries  in  Tulsa  generally  require  technology 
training  and  higher  education.  The  city  is  currently  facing  a 
gap in middle-skilled employees, generally jobs requiring an 
associate degree or two-year technical training. In Tulsa, these 
jobs pay on average $7 more per hour than those requiring a 
high school diploma or its equivalent and $14 more per hour 
than those without any formal education certificate. The wage 
gap  is  exacerbated  among  historically  marginalized  groups. 
For example, the median wealth for White Tulsans is 18 times 
more than that of Black Tulsans. For all Tulsans to achieve fiscal 
wellbeing, they must have access to high-quality educational 
and workforce opportunities. Through the Actions under this 
Goal, the City will engage the available workforce, employers, 
and  key  economic  development  partners  to  identify  specific 

labor gaps and address them directly.

Engage Tulsa’s primary industries, such as 
energy, healthcare, and aerospace employers, 
to strategically address and close industry-

and d facilitate focused conversations about 
discrete skill needs with local industry leaders. 
Emphasis will be on skills that employees must 
have in order to succeed, rather than on baseline 
credentials. As a result of their recommendations, 
the Tulsa Regional Chamber, Tulsa technical 
schools, and Workforce Tulsa  will be able to 
better match skilled jobseekers with available 
positions. Academic institutions will adopt 
recommendations by better tailoring their 
programs to necessary and in-demand skills.

TULSA CITY-COUNTY LIBRARY PROGRAMS
The Tulsa City-County Library (TCCL) system has a 
vast array of programs specific to the needs of the 
neighborhoods in which a library branch is located. 
To meet the needs of all Tulsans, TCCL provides job 
assistance, adult literacy programming, resources and 
guidance about the Affordable Care Act, and business 
resources. The staff at TCCL are trained to provide 
guidance on these and other topics, helping meet the 
needs of thousands of Tulsans each year. TCCL is not only 
a place for the community to experience the enjoyment 
of books, but a vital resource for the community.

Join with strategic partners and amplify their 
existing efforts to develop a strategy for second-
chance hiring. While many local employers are 
amenable to becoming second-chance employers 
and hiring people who were involved in the 
justice system, many businesses (particularly 
small businesses) lack the human resource and 
legal departments needed to assess and create 
second chance hiring processes. A task force 
composed of representatives from industry 
leaders, non-profits, and City agencies will lead 
the process of diagnosing the challenges and 
developing recommendations. While a ‘deep-
dive’ assessment of a specific industry will, by 
definition, be most useful to the industry in 
question, employers from within other related 
industries can look to this tool as a framework 
for initiatives that they too can take to improve 
their hiring practices.

We envision a city where local and regional

have access to necessary civic services.
 

Tulsa has a wide-range of public, private, and non-profit service providers, 
and communities rely on their large presence for basic needs. Partnerships 
and streamlined communication between groups can diagnose and tackle 
the needs of constituents, particularly as they vary across the city’s

GOAL 4.1

 

 DESIGN MORE RESPONSIVE AND TRANSPARENT 
INTERNAL PROCESSES THAT PROMOTE PROACTIVE 

DECISION MAKING THROUGH THE INCREASED USE OF 

DATA AND COMMUNITY FEEDBACK BY 2022

The city’s history of racial prejudice produced inequitable City 
investments throughout the years. As a result, majority people 
of  color  communities  are  often  deemed  “low  opportunity 
areas”  given  the  historic  neglect  of  City  assets  and  public 
amenities. With the State’s budgetary restrictions, the City of 
Tulsa has increasingly limited discretionary funds to deploy. 
Through  the  Actions  under  this  Goal,  the  City  will  ensure 
data-driven  oversight,  accountability,  and  evidence-based 
policymaking  to  combat  implicit  biases  and  ensure  high-

USE EQUALITY 
INDICATORS TO SUPPORT 
POLICY DEVELOPMENT

SHORT-TERM;  
2019 Q1 REVIEW AND REANALYSIS  

Revisit the 2018 Equality Indicators annually 
to measure and evaluate change, over time, 
from baseline data. The Equality Indicators is a 
comprehensive tool originally developed by the 
CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance 
(CUNY ISLG) that helps cities understand and 
measure equality or equity in their city. The 
City of Tulsa partnered closely with the local 
organization Community Service Council to 
tailor this tool to the issues most important to 
residents of Tulsa. The tool examines multiple 
areas (e.g., education, housing, justice) and 
measures the disparities faced by disadvantaged 
groups (those most vulnerable to inequality, 
such as racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, 
or individuals living in poverty) across those 
domains annually, tracking change over time. 
The Equality Indicators tool will be used as 
a framework to support policy development, 
demonstrating the effectiveness of current 
policies and initiatives, and highlighting areas 
in which new policies and initiatives may be 
needed. Making data publicly available will 
increase transparency and accountability, 
allowing the local community an inside view 
into the disparities in their city, where progress 
is being made, and opportunities for additional 
improvement.

VISION 04
GOAL 4.1

HOW THE CITY  
USES DATA 

The City of Tulsa and Mayor Bynum 
believe  that  using  data  to  inform 
policy-making  is  a  necessity.  At  the  City,  the 
Office  of  Performance  Strategy  and  Innovation 
(OPSI)  empowers  the  organization  to  use  data 
to align citywide strategies toward priority goals 
set by the Mayor and City Council while lowering 
barriers  to  adopting  innovative  practices.  OPSI 
informs city operations through the use of three 
pillars:  strategies,  data  and  transparency,  and 
results-based programs; other offices within the 
City utilize the same three pillar structure. 

The strategies the City is currently employing are 
the AIM plan, Oklahoma Quality Foundation, and 
the Annual Mayor and Council Retreat. The AIM 
Plan is a two-year strategic plan that includes the 
City’s high-level goals, community performance 
indicators,  actions,  and  metrics  for  measuring 
progress. Oklahoma Quality Foundation is a way 
for the City to comprehensively examine how it 
performs as an organization in the six key areas 
of  leadership,  strategy,  customers,  workforce, 
operations,  measurement  and  analysis,  and 
results.  Annual  Mayor  and  Council  Retreats 
bring  the  City’s  leaders  together  to  develop 
and  agree  on  priorities  for  the  calendar  year. 
Tulsa  will  also  be  using  the  Resilient  Tulsa  and 
New  Tulsans  strategies  to  inform  and  shape 
equitable  and  welcoming  policies  throughout 
the  city.  Each  strategy  developed  and  used  by 
the City is measurable, actionable, and relies on 
outcome  measurements  and  data  to  affirm  its 
effectiveness.

Data and transparency is a vital pillar within the 
City’s policy decision-making process. The sharing 
of  data  through  the  City’s  Dashboards  not  only 
allows City employees but also the public to track 
the progress and alignment of City strategies and 
plans.  Data  communication  through  the  use  of 
Dashboards aids the City in its decision-making, 
and  also  provides  citizens  with  a  transparent 

visual of how the city is progressing in a particular 
area.  To  further  engage  citizens,  the  City 
developed  Urban  Data  Pioneers,  a  program  that 
brings  teams  of  city  employees  and  community 
members  together  to  examine  questions  that 
can  be  better  understood  through  further  data 
analysis  and  reporting.  In  collaboration  with 
the  Community  Services  Council,  the  City  has 
also  recently  begun  using  Equality  Indicators, 
a  measure  of  social  development  outcomes,  to 
track  changes  in  equality  among  the  different 
areas and demographic groups in Tulsa. Creating 
urban  transformation  by  examining  feedback  is 
also what the Gallup-Tulsa CitiVoice Index seeks 
to  do.  The  Gallup-Tulsa  CitiVoice  Index  will  be 
administered  in  the  later  half  of  2018,  with  the 
results  acting  as  a  driving  force  in  economic 
development, growth, and policy changes. 

Ultimately,  the  City  is  focused  on  providing 
meaningful,  equitable  governance,  which  is  the 
basis for the City’s third and final data-use pillar. 
As  part  of  this  result-focused  pillar,  the  City 
has  Civic  Innovation  Fellowships  and  a  regular 
meeting  called  TulStat.  The  Civic  Innovation 
Fellows  will  engage  six  city  residents  for  six 
months to deeply diagnose a problem in the city, 
develop theories of change, test these theories of 
change and develop recommendations based on 
results of a prototype. Similarly, TulStat sessions 
create  a  space  for  City  department  leaders  to 
discuss  performance  metrics,  guided  by  the 
City’s strategic goals. The intent of TulStat is to 
continuously develop new innovative approaches 
to  problems  while  regularly  following-up  on 
and measuring progress. Together the programs 
found  under  each  pillar  help 
inform  City 
governing decisions and policy making while also 
providing  transparency  to  the  public.  Because 
of  the  continued  exchange  and  tracking  of 
information, the City is able to address problems 
with innovative solutions.

The  City  does  not  have  a  unified,  standard  process  for 
engaging  citizens  and  ensuring  that  all  communities  are 
adequately  supported  across  all  services.  The  variety  of 
neighborhoods  creates  an  inherent  challenge  in  deploying 
resources  effectively.  Nearly  400  organized  neighborhood 
associations  are  established  within  Tulsa  city  limits.38  The 
community  groups  must  be  leveraged  to  better  understand 
neighborhood-specific  needs.  Without  this  consistent  and 
wide-reaching feedback, the City is unable to ensure that all 
communities achieve the same quality of services. The wide 
array of non-profit providers plays a critical role in supporting 
the City in filling gaps in services. Through the Actions under 
this Goal, the City will take on the critical role of facilitating, 
overseeing, and convening the necessary groups. With proper 
internal processes and dedicated staff members, the City will 
create a network of community resources and more efficiently 

serve all Tulsans’ needs.

Establish formal processes by which Citizen 
Advisory Board and Citizen Action Group 
members are selected and formalize the length

Citizen Action Groups were recently created 
by Mayor Bynum as part of the City of Tulsa’s 
Community Policing Recommendations to help 
build collaboration between the community 
and the Tulsa Police Department. These 
groups will work with and advise the Tulsa 
Police Department, improving communication 
and promoting positive police-community 
relationships. To ensure sustainability and 
democratic representation on the Citizen 
Advisory Board, members will serve a two year 
term. Members of the Citizen Action Groups 
will serve a one year term, but will not be term 
limited as long as they continue living in the 
neighborhood they represent. To assist with the 
process of replacing members as they conclude 
their service, the Mayor’s Office of Resilience 
and Equity will create an application process so 
interested community members can apply to 
serve when a Citizen Advisory Board or Citizen

 ACTION 35 

LAUNCH CITY-HALL-
ON-THE-GO

MID-TERM;  
2020 Q4 LAUNCH

Outfit a vehicle to act as a mobile City Hall. 
Citizens across Tulsa have limited time, and some 
have limited transportation. These restrictions 
limit the public’s knowledge of City services, 
and also make it difficult to pay bills, fines, 
and fees during regular hours of operation. To 
improve communication with constituents and 
enhance accessibility, the City of Tulsa will equip 
a van with necessary technology, tools, and 
departmental employees as a City-Hall-on-the-
go. With the aid of a weekly schedule, City-Hall-
on-the-go will visit high need areas of town in 
centrally located, convenient locations.

SHORT-TERM;

Create a City Communications and Engagement 
Strategic Plan and Manual that applies to all 
City departments, and develop a City Hall 
Docent Program to help community members 
during public meetings. To address the difficulty 
Tulsa residents have navigating City Hall and 
to improve engagement with all Tulsans, the 
City will employ a communications strategic 
plan, improving communication and message 
continuity between City departments and city 
residents. Additionally, to encourage Tulsans’ 
involvement in City meetings and better 
navigation of City Hall, the City will develop a 
City Hall Docent Program. City Hall docents will 
be volunteers who have previously worked for 
the City and will be available year-round to usher 
visitors around City Hall and educate Tulsans 
about  the location of departments, City history, 
and the processes of participating in various City 
meetings.

RESILIENT TULSAGOAL 4.3

 

CHAMPION IMPROVED POLICIES ACROSS THE REGION 

THAT ADVANCE TULSANS’ WELLBEING,  

STARTING IN 2019 

The  State  of  Oklahoma  is  in  a  budget  crisis.  Annual  budget 
shortfalls have snowballed and 2019 is facing a $167 million 
deficit. Tulsa, like all cities in Oklahoma, is almost exclusively 
restricted to using sales tax funds for operations. Over the last 
15 years, the rate of sales tax growth in the city has not kept 
up with the rate of inflation. This volatility is compounded by 
changing spending habits as consumers increasingly turn to 
online retailers. Increasing the City’s sales tax rate is difficult 
in  light  of  the  total  tax  burden  faced  by  citizens  and  would 
disproportionately  affect  low-income  Tulsans  who  spend 
the majority of their income on basic needs that are subject 
to  sales  tax.  To  increase  sales  tax  revenue,  citizens  must 
have  higher-quality  jobs  that  provide  them  with  disposable 
income. Yet, the adjudicated population is barred from many 
high-paying  professions  because  of  their  criminal  record, 
regardless  of  offense  or  any  recovery  steps  taken.  Through 
the Actions under this Goal, the City will lobby for change at 
the state level by advocating for the wellbeing of all Tulsans. 
The  City  will  also  pilot  innovative  solutions  to  addressing 
Mayoral priorities, reducing funding gaps for key services, and 
addressing  resilience  challenges  without  relying  heavily  on 

the State.

 

 

 

ACTION 39:   

Invest in a Mayor’s Office for Strategic 

Partnerships for Mayoral Priorities

ACTION 40:  

Lobby the State for municipal funding and 

optimize fees for service

ACTION 41:  

Advocate for the reform of expungement 
practice and licensing restrictions statewide

 ACTION 39

INVEST IN A MAYOR’S 
OFFICE FOR STRATEGIC 
PARTNERSHIPS FOR 
MAYORAL PRIORITIES

LONG-TERM;  
2021 Q2 LAUNCH 

Create a Mayor’s Office for Strategic Partnerships 
to support mayoral priorities. Creating and 
investing in a Mayor’s Office for Strategic 
Partnerships and a resilience project fund will 
allow the Mayor to partner with local business, 
nonprofits, and foundations to address funding 
gaps. A resilience project fund will allow each 
Mayor, in conjunction with the fund’s governing 
board, to prioritize  innovative policies or 
programs that strengthen the city and further 
build its resilience. The development of the 
resilience project fund will take approximately 
two years but ultimately act as a sustainable 
source of funding for vital programming that 
addresses urgent needs, to the benefit of all 
Tulsans.

GOAL 4.3

 ACTION 40 

LOBBY THE STATE FOR 
MUNICIPAL FUNDING 
AND OPTIMIZE FEES 
FOR SERVICE

MID-TERM;  
2019 Q1 LAUNCH

Urge State lawmakers to allow cities the ability 
to diversify revenue streams. This campaign 
seeks to diversify municipalities’ revenue streams 
to combat the City’s heavy reliance on the 
collection of sales tax from residents and allow 
for stable and adequate funding of top priorities, 
such as education. In addition to lobbying State 
elected officials for increased municipal funding 
sources, the City of Tulsa will develop a schedule 
for reviewing and adjusting fees for service. 
Currently, the City periodically reviews fees for 
service; to optimize the fees collected and ensure 
no unnecessary fees are charged, scheduling fees 
adjustment reviews allows the City to provide 
quality services for all Tulsans. Together these 
two changes will create sources of sustainable 
funding for the City of Tulsa and its residents to 
prepare for future changes and challenges. 

 ACTION 41

ADVOCATE FOR THE REFORM OF 
EXPUNGEMENT PRACTICE AND LICENSING 
RESTRICTIONS STATEWIDE

LONG-TERM;  
2021 Q2 LAUNCH 

Promote expungement practice and licensing 
restriction reforms at the State level. Oklahoma 
has a particularly strict penal code and associated 
restrictions that place unequal significant 
collateral consequences on non-violent, low-level 
offenders. The City of Tulsa will pursue statewide 
policy change to prevent individuals with low-
level, non-violent offenses from being restricted 
from professional opportunities. In collaboration 
with the City of Tulsa and Tulsa County, local 
workforce development entities, and second-
chance employers, the City will develop a policy 
agenda for the State government, namely the 
legislature and Governor’s Cabinet. Reform of the 
statewide expungement process can be addressed 
by implementing the 2017 Oklahoma Licensing 
Task Force recommendations to better enable 
the employment of adjudicated individuals. 
Recognizing the time necessary to effectively 
change State policies, the City of Tulsa will 
continue to support local second chance hiring 
while fighting for the removal of employment 
barriers.
