Welcome.

Where are you from? We hear this question every day, all over South Florida. Some of us 
are from up north and came to thaw out. Some of us are from countries to the south and 
came to escape turmoil. Wherever we came from and for whatever reason, we now call 
South Florida home. We savor the unique culture our diversity has created as well as its 
opportunities. And together, we face Florida’s multitude of natural disasters—hurricanes, 
tropical storms and tropical depressions, tornadoes, wildfires, and floods.

Our resilience strategy—that is, planning for and dealing with such adversity—begins 
with and ends with our people, with you. We are surrounded by family and friends. We 
are part of neighborhoods, community organizations, businesses, and churches. The 
intricate systems and processes that support us—transportation, water, the environment, 
food, and energy—also connect us. However, we are a large, complex, and diverse region 
and sometimes individuals and communities fall through the cracks. This document is 
intended to address this and other resilience challenges through intergovernmental and 
community collaboration. This resilience strategy will build on our existing networks and 
endeavor to safeguard our people, our homes, and our livelihoods, so that no person, 
neighborhood, or business is left behind. 

Resilience, for us, means providing the opportunity for every person and every 
community to bounce back after large-scale flooding events, hurricanes, or economic 
hardships, and to not only survive, but thrive in the face of sea level rise, expensive 
housing, challenging traffic, and uncertain labor markets. By connecting, engaging, and 
empowering every voice in our community, we will stand strong and share our unique 
South Florida story. Join us in this journey.

Dear Residents, Businesses, and Partners in the 305:

As we launch this Resilient305 Strategy in the spring of 2019, 
cities around the world are also issuing their plans to tackle the 
many challenges to come in the decades ahead as ocean waters 
rise and average global temperatures increase.

Our shared community of Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, 
and the City of Miami Beach has had both the honor and the 
responsibility of being the first regional partnership that was 
invited to join the 100 Resilient Cities initiative. First created 
in 2013 for the Rockefeller Foundation’s centennial year, that 
important worldwide collaboration has enabled us to share our 
best practices, built across party lines and governing boundaries, 
with other local and international leaders. 

In the following pages you will find 59 specific actions already 
in the works to ensure that our region of Greater Miami & the 
Beaches thrives for generations to come. Our Resilient305 
Strategy also offers 28 case studies showcasing clearly defined 
steps that local groups are currently taking to ensure that we 
reach our goals.

MAYOR DAN GELBER 
CITY OF MIAMI BEACH

MAYOR CARLOS A. GIMENEZ
MIAMI-DADE COUNTY

We are grateful to the many exceptional leaders and partners 
who have helped us thus far in our journey. That includes former 
City of Miami Mayor Tomas Regalado and former Miami Beach 
Mayor Philip Levine, who opened the doors to our inclusion in 
the 100RC initiative in 2016; scores of collaborators who have 
since joined us in this Resilient305 mission at the numerous city, 
county, business, philanthropic and educational organizations that 
you will read about in this report; and countless others who have 
also played vital roles beyond the scope of this report. 

The 305 Community has never known a challenge like this, and 
the task ahead is as daunting as the one we faced in the space 
race of the 1960s. Like those successful Moonshots, this will 
require new ingenuity, collaboration, and a sense of urgency. 
Together, we can and will rise to the occasion and create a more 
resilient future for our planet. Thank you for joining us in this 
transformative work.

LETTERS OF SUPPORTGREATER MIAMI & THE BEACHESLETTER FROM 100 RESILIENT CITIES

On behalf of 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), I want to congratulate Mayor 
Gelber, Mayor Gimenez, Mayor Suarez, and the entire Greater Miami & 
the Beaches (GM&B) team on the release of the Resilient305 Strategy, 
a major milestone in our partnership and the result of a tremendous 
collective effort.

The unique collaboration between Miami-Dade County, the City of 
Miami, and the City of Miami Beach (collectively, the GM&B region) 
stands out in the 100RC network as the only regional partnership 
between a county and two cities working together to create a shared 
resilience strategy. Located in a dynamic and growing coastal region, 
GM&B is acutely aware of the environmental, social, and economic 
challenges it faces—from severe storms and sea level rise to mobility 
and housing affordability—and the need to work together on solutions 
that promise a strong future for all. The 59 actions detailed in the 
Resilient305 Strategy will help the region thrive in the face of these 
challenges, while the partnerships that were formed and strengthened 
through this process will ensure that the GM&B region can address 
future shocks and stresses, both known and unknown.

MICHAEL BERKOWITZ 
100 RESILIENT CITIES

Framed through the lens of Places, People, and Pathways, this strategy presents a roadmap for safeguarding the region’s beautiful natural 
environment while connecting, enhancing, and adapting its vibrant communities; for bolstering the health, educational, and economic 
resources that enable individual residents to survive and thrive in both good times and bad; and for strengthening the connections, 
partnerships, and systems that facilitate collective action in tackling GM&B’s shared resilience challenges.

This innovative strategy would not be possible without the leadership of GM&B’s Chief Resilience Officers, Jane Gilbert, Jim Murley, and 
Susanne Torriente, and the numerous municipal staff and community partners who have contributed their time, energy, expertise, and 
willingness to experiment on a new approach. Through information gathered from over 150 public meetings involving over 1,100 participants, 
and an additional 2,400 survey responses, the strategy development process was truly a collaborative and participatory endeavor, yielding a 
clear set of intergovernmental and community priorities on which to build resilience.

While the release of the Resilient305 Strategy represents a remarkable achievement, the work is far from over. As Greater Miami & the 
Beaches continues its resilience journey through implementation of this strategy, we are confident this unique partnership will strengthen 
and grow. Through collective and individual action, Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and the City of Miami Beach – along with the many 
partner organizations who make up Greater Miami & the Beaches – will lead the region toward a vibrant future while serving as a global 
model for regional resilience. 

Michael Berkowitz, President 100 Resilient Cities

LETTERS OF SUPPORTRESILIENT305 STRATEGYMEET YOUR CHIEF 
RESILIENCE OFFICERS

Dear friends:

In the spring of 2016 this rather unique partnership, Greater 
Miami & the Beaches, became the first two cities and a county 
to join the 100RC network as one. We were chosen because we 
are urban inventors willing to partner. And in a sense, we were 
already pioneers among pioneers. We were chosen because 
we could give to the network and we would receive from the 
network. And we have. 

As CRO’s we have convened, listened and connected our 
beautiful and vulnerable PLACES, our diverse and already 
resilient PEOPLE and we found PATHWAYS to a stronger future. 
During this planning process we also put many ideas into action 
through our individual government investments and through the 
unique opportunities our partnership presented. Resilient305 is 
our collective resilience Strategy. It builds upon the challenges 
and strengths of the past to address the shocks and stresses of 
today and tomorrow. We hope that you will find your role in this 
plan and PIVOT with us into the future.

We want to thank and recognize so many important individuals 
without whom this plan could not have been written. To start, 
thank you to the thousands of individuals and organizations 
that have contributed ideas, context and feedback throughout 
this journey. We are fortunate to have hard working and 
talented staff; supportive and visionary bosses; 100 Resilient 
Cities current and former relationship managers Eric Wilson 
and Peter Jenkins providing network resources and, at times, 
therapy; The Miami Foundation for believing in the original 
intergovernmental experiment in collaboration; and finally our 
strategic partner AECOM – Claire Bonham-Carter for her insight 
and patience, especially Lauren Swan, our local AECOM task 
master extraordinaire and a good friend of the Greater Miami & 
the Beaches partnership.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
What is Greater Miami and the Beaches?

Greater Miami & the Beaches (GM&B) is a unique partnership of Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and the City of Miami Beach. We came 
together to lead development of our community’s resilience under the 100 Resilient Cities Network – Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. 
Because the GM&B community is often referred to by our area code, “the 305” we thought it fitting that this document, GM&B’s collaborative 
resilience building strategy, be titled Resilient305.   To ensure Resilient305 has broad impact, GM&B will continue to expand to include the 
remaining 32 municipalities, other community organizations and anchor institutions in implementation. 

What is the Resilient305 Strategy?

This Resilient305 Strategy is a living document created to address resilience challenges we prioritized through intergovernmental and 
community collaboration. Throughout the process – in public meetings, surveys and focus groups - GM&B engaged thousands of stakeholders 
to help shape the Strategy and make sure it reflected the input from a wide range of expertise, ages, ethnicities, cultures, income levels and 
geographic areas. This continued interaction will be key to the successful implementation of the Strategy. 

As our community continues to grow and evolve, the Resilient305 Strategy will encourage us to work together to better prepare for an 
increasing occurrence of shocks, such as hurricanes, and infrastructure failures, as well as better mitigate stresses, such as sea level rise 
and sunny day flooding, crippling traffic and severe economic inequities. Even during the planning process, our resilience was tested by the 
Zika outbreak and Hurricane Irma.  We are stronger because of our experiences and have incorporated many of the lessons learned into this 
document.

We recognize that even our passion and dedication doesn’t prevent some of our most vulnerable from falling through the cracks.  We hope 
that the Resilient305 Strategy will serve as a foundation in building a strong network focused on addressing equity gaps and elevating our 
vulnerable populations.  We believe that together we have an opportunity to work differently and more effectively by promoting  stronger 
leadership, closer collaboration, and better use of our resources.

What challenges will the Resilient305 Strategy tackle?

Over 50 actions have been identified, developed and organized for the Resilient305 Strategy into three overarching goal areas: Places, 
People, and Pathways. To better define the actions that would be included in the strategy, we focused on opportunities where we were best 
positioned to move the needle and separated them from those where we were better suited to complement the exceptional work that is 
already being done throughout various communities in the region.

GREATER MIAMI & THE BEACHESEXECUTIVE SUMMARYGOALS
Places – Lugares -Kote

Many of us came to this part of Southeast Florida because we were drawn by the beautiful natural environment, balmy climate and the 
surrounding clear waters of this sub-tropical paradise.  Those same features today simultaneously pose threats and offer opportunities.  
Through our “Places” actions, we aim to address location-based challenges and improve our climate resilience through research, design and 
planning; create, connect, and improve mobility and housing options; and enhance and safeguard our ecosystems. 

People – Gente – Moun

Individual people are the heart and soul of resilient cities.  If individuals do not have access to certain basic needs, their resilience is diminished 
and so too is the resilience of their neighborhoods  and communities.  Through our “People” actions, we aim to improve the lives of our 
citizens every day, whether sunny or stormy, by supporting job and wealth creation; addressing specific health needs for the most vulnerable 
among us; and preparing and empowering neighborhoods and networks to anticipate and respond to disruptions, both large and small. 

Pathways – Caminos - Wout

“Pathways” is the strategic course we take to accomplish our goals by expanding our networks and sharing resources and tools. It is our “how 
to” guide.  Through our “Pathways” actions, we aim to build the connections, collaborations, and committed leadership needed to change the 
status quo, enabling GM&B to become a global leader in resilience. We can achieve this by setting realistic and common goals, and committing 
to actions that bring together governments, businesses, community organizations and educational institutions. 

PIVOT – Making it happen

GM&B recognizes that implementing each of the actions within the Resilient305 strategy will require dedicated effort from ourselves and 
our partners, guided by a team that we call PIVOT or “Progress, Innovation, and Vision for Our Tomorrow”. The initial PIVOT team will be 
comprised of leadership from Miami-Dade County, City of Miami, City of Miami Beach and The Miami Foundation, and will expand over time to 
include representatives from community partners.  This team will look at resources, timeframes and priorities to develop a work plan and will 
oversee the implementation and progress of the Strategy.  

Join us in the Resilient305 Movement!

WHO IS GREATER MIAMI  
& THE BEACHES?

Greater Miami & the Beaches (GM&B) is a collaboration of Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and the City of Miami Beach, created 
to respond to the region’s major challenges. As GM&B matures, the partners hope that GM&B will expand to include the remaining 32 
GM&B municipalities within Miami-Dade County. 

In 2016, after a very competitive process, GM&B was selected from among 400 applicants to join the 100 Resilient Cities network as 
the only inter-governmental partnership working to develop a shared resilience strategy.

WHAT IS 100 RESILIENT CITIES?

100 Resilient Cities – Pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation (100RC) was launched in 2013 to help cities around the world become 
more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century.

100RC supports the adoption and incorporation of a view of resilience that addresses not just the shocks—hurricanes, economic crash, 
floods, etc.—but also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city or a region on a day-to-day or cyclical basis. Resilience is what 
allows cities to adapt and transform in the face of these challenges, helping them to prepare for and respond in the face of both the 
expected and the unexpected.

In GM&B, stresses include aging infrastructure, an inadequate public transportation system, sea level rise, pronounced poverty, and 
health disparities. By addressing both the shocks and the stresses in a holistic manner, we become more prepared to respond to 
adverse events and better able to deliver basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.

WHAT IS RESILIENT305?

GM&B’s Resilience Strategy—the Resilient305 Strategy—has been created as a living document to address prioritized resilience 
challenges through intergovernmental and community collaboration. Often referred to by our area code, the “305” has become a 
common nickname for local efforts. Not all our challenges will be addressed through actions in this resilience Strategy. Some of the 
issues are already being tackled by other plans or entities, such as decreasing congestion and improving transit through the Strategic 
Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Plan, mental health through the new Miami Center for Mental Health and Recovery and the work 
of many social service providers and initiatives, and affordable housing through in-development Affordable Housing Master Plans. 
The resilience challenges tackled in Resilient305 were identified through a rigorous process that included extensive stakeholder 
engagement.

RESILIENT305 STRATEGYOUR STORYGM&B IN CONTEXT

As the southeast tip of the Florida peninsula and most southern land 
mass on the United States mainland, GM&B is a low-lying coastal 
community that totals 2,431 square miles, including 1,898 square 
miles of land. GM&B also comprises 533 square miles of water and is 
adjacent to three water bodies, including Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic 
Ocean on its eastern boundary, and the Florida Strait on the southern 
boundary. 

The northern, central, and eastern portions of GM&B are heavily 
developed with numerous high-rise buildings along the eastern 
coastline and Miami River. South Florida’s central business district is in 
downtown Miami and its primary tourist destination is Miami Beach. 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Miami-Dade County is the most 
populated county within the State of Florida and the seventh most 
populated county in the United States. It has an average density of 
1,464 persons per square mile with an approximate population of 2.7 
million residents across 34 GM&B municipalities and unincorporated 
areas. 

Of the population 25 years and older, 26 percent has a bachelor’s 
degree or equivalent, slightly below the national average of 32 percent. 
The census identifies 16.7 percent of the population living in poverty, 
which is 4 percent higher than the national average. Some 68 percent 
of the resident population is Hispanic or Latino with a 53 percent 
foreign-born population. The multicultural composition of GM&B has 
continued to grow since 1961 with a 10.2 percent population increase 
between 2010 and 2017. This overall growth is expected to continue.

Every year, GM&B sees an influx of approximately 16 million visitors, 
predominantly for business purposes, or to visit the National Parks, 
sandy beaches, and turquoise waters. Cruise vacations and major 
events lure additional visitors. According to Miami-Dade County, GM&B’s 
economy has continued to strengthen since the end of the Great 
Recession in 2010 with an increasing number of corporate headquarters 
for both the United States and Latin America located here. As the 
“Gateway to the Americas,” GM&B hosts more than 700 multinational 
companies.

RESILIENT305 STRATEGYOUR STORYOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SOUTHEAST FLORIDA 
REGIONAL CLIMATE COMPACT HAS TAUGHT US HOW 
TO BETTER COLLABORATE, PREDICT, AND PLAN. 

In 2009, officials in South Florida lobbied for a federal climate policy in Washington, D.C., and quickly discovered they didn’t have enough clout as 
a single entity for their requests to be prioritized. Officials needed to speak as a region to have more impact. Leaders from Palm Beach, Broward, 
Miami-Dade, and Monroe Counties formed a voluntary and collaborative partnership called the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change 
Compact to work on issues such as rising temperatures, increased storm activity, and sea level rise that clearly cross municipal boundaries. The 
Compact’s initial work was to develop and agree to consistent sea level rise projections, a regional vulnerability assessment, and the region’s 
first greenhouse gas inventory. As the efforts of the Compact expanded, this innovative form of collaboration has become a model for regions 
around the nation and internationally. As a result, GM&B is leveraging the Compact and seeking to replicate the approach to engage GM&B 
municipalities in the GM&B region to address shared problems, advance shared priorities, and provide technical assistance. In 2018, Miami-Dade 
County hosted the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Leadership Summit with a record attendance of more than 700 participants. 

Sunny day or nuisance flooding during high tides is now a regular occurrence in parts of GM&B due to the elevation and the geology of the 
region, disrupting daily life and causing economic impacts to residents and businesses alike. This is only going to get worse as sea levels 
continue to rise. GM&B is seen as an early actor in adapting to sea level rise, such as through raising roads in Miami Beach.

OUR HISTORY OF HURRICANES HAS TAUGHT US 
TO PREPARE BETTER, RESPOND QUICKER, AND 
RECOVER SMARTER. 

In 1992, Hurricane Andrew hit Miami-Dade County with devastating impact, destroying homes and businesses. This Category 5 hurricane left 
Miami-Dade County with 175,000 people homeless and 1.4 million people without power in a very hot and humid climate. As a result, Miami-
Dade County and its municipal partners developed a unified emergency response network and collaborated to develop one of the strongest 
building codes in the nation. After Hurricane Andrew, Miami-Dade County also founded the Homeless Trust, which today is one of the nation’s 
most successful systems for ending homelessness. In 2018, Miami-Dade County saw an 8 percent reduction in homelessness.

In 2005, two hurricanes hit our region within a 2-month span, causing $2.9 billion in damages. The Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) issued disaster declarations and response teams were deployed from all over the country to support our emergency operations and 
disaster clean-up after Hurricane Katrina. Meanwhile, we were simultaneously preparing for our next storm, Hurricane Wilma, which produced 
a 6-foot storm surge in some areas of Miami-Dade County and caused over 98 percent of our residents to lose power for weeks. As a result, 
gas stations and larger grocery stores are now required to have back up power and fuel on site. In 2017, Hurricane Irma forced evacuations 
for the first time in over a decade. The debris from the hurricane’s aftermath took months to clean-up.  As a result of our experience in 
coping with the aftermath of hurricanes, GM&B municipalities in the GM&B region have begun working with local organizations to have 
clean-up crews in place prior to an anticipated severe weather event. In addition, local nonprofits have a renewed interest in building disaster 
awareness and preparedness at the community level.

RESILIENT305 STRATEGYOUR STORYOUR GROWING POPULATION HAS TAUGHT US THE 
IMPORTANCE OF BETTER MOBILITY OPTIONS.

Over the last 50 years, we have continued to experience development growth and population influx, leading to increasingly 
congested roadways. According to the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), in 2018, commuters averaged 60-minute 
daily commute times. In an effort to reduce travel costs and congestion, the Transportation Planning Organization (TPO) 
prioritized rapid transit and transit supportive projects for GM&B. Ongoing efforts include the SMART Plan’s six major 
transit corridors, a drive to support Transit-Oriented Development as well as making grid-based route adjustments, and 
implementation of an Advanced Traffic Management System to increase reliability and reduce travel time for 80 percent of 
bus riders. In addition to TPO initiatives, several GM&B municipalities within the GM&B region, including the City of Miami 
and City of Miami Beach, operate trolley systems without fares to encourage ridership. In partnership with the South Florida 
Regional Planning Council (SFRPC) and South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), GM&B is aiming to reduce 
dependence on privately owned vehicles from its current 97 percent to 65 percent over the next 50 years.

OUR EXPERIENCE WITH HIGH RATES OF PROPERTY 
FORECLOSURES HAS TAUGHT US TO BETTER 
DIVERSIFY OUR ECONOMY AND REVENUE SOURCES. 

Miami-Dade County was severely affected in 2007 by the mortgage crisis with more than 79,000 residential foreclosures, 
resulting in aggregate residential loss of value from $258 billion in 2008 to $157 billion in 2012. The largest source of 
revenue for GM&B municipalities is property taxes, which declined by 27 percent. This decline resulted in the elimination 
of discretionary reserves and a loss of funding for many community-based organizations. In 2012, the Miami-Dade Beacon 
Council, the economic development agency for Miami-Dade County, updated its long-term economic development strategy, 
One Community One Goal.  This effort involved public, private and nonprofit organizations in developing and implementing a 
strategy to diversify our industry base and retain local talent. In 2018, the County welcomed more than $402 million in new 
capital investments.

RESILIENT305 STRATEGYOUR STORYOUR DIVERSE, FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION 
HAS TAUGHT US TO EXPAND OUR COMMUNITY 
ACTION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE EFFORTS. 

Approximately 500,000 Cubans, most of them business people and professionals, arrived in Miami during a 15-year period 
after the Cuban Revolution in 1959. In 1980, the Mariel boatlift allowed as many as 125,000 Cubans to emigrate to Florida 
in search of both political freedom and economic opportunities. Much of the population settled in the GM&B region, forever 
changing the cultural and demographic flavor of the area. Since then, both our federal and local governments have continued 
to enact Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to welcome persons from places who leave their countries due to extreme 
environmental, political, and/or economic impacts that compromise their livelihoods. An example includes Haitians impacted 
by the 3.2 magnitude earthquake of 2010, which severely crippled their country. Climate change may increase that flow.

As new residents assimilate, make the GM&B their home, and participate in our communities as tax paying residents, the 
needs of an influx of new people can also stress our social services networks. These networks have been assisted by 
community-based organizations that have historically been reliant on local, state, and federal government funding. However, in 
recent years funding sources have broadened to include more private partnerships. Community-based organizations have also 
begun collaborating to avoid duplication of services and to develop more creative, solution-based approaches for our diverse 
and culturally significant populations, which today generate an estimated $1.43 billion in annual economic activity.

OUR OVERWHELMED CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM HAS TAUGHT US THE VALUE OF SOCIAL 
SERVICES AS PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS.

The Miami-Dade County jail currently serves as the largest psychiatric institution in Florida and contains nearly as many beds 
serving inmates with mental illnesses as all state civil and forensic mental health facilities combined. GM&B’s high percentage 
of people with serious mental illnesses combined with its relatively low level of funding for treatment programs has led to 
arrest and incarceration of mentally ill individuals for criminal offenses that are directly related to psychiatric symptoms or 
life circumstances (e.g. homelessness, addiction, poverty). On any given day, the jail houses approximately 2,400 individuals 
receiving psychotherapeutic medications, and costs taxpayers roughly $180 million annually or $500,000 per day. 

The response to this challenge has been multisectoral and multijurisdictional. 35 different police departments have Crisis 
Intervention Teams (CIT) which are comprised of police officers trained to recognize and respond to individuals experiencing 
psychiatric emergencies, and to assist them in accessing services, in lieu of arrest, when appropriate. If individuals are 
arrested, there are post-booking mental health jail diversion programs that seek to divert nonviolent offenders with serious 
mental illnesses away from the criminal justice system into comprehensive community-based treatment and support 
services. A new mental health diversion facility is currently being built to serve and house these mentally ill individuals who 
need psychiatric services but are currently homeless and/or being handled by the criminal justice system. There are also 
interventions beyond the criminal justice system like the Lazarus Project, launched in 2014, which brings direct outreach to 
chronically homeless individuals living on the streets, with the goal of eventually moving individuals into permanent housing. 
Social services and programming are also being used as interventions for other public health threats, like youth violence via 
the Together for Children initiative.

RESILIENT305 STRATEGYOUR STORYPARTNERSHIP ACHIEVEMENTS

  `  The 5-Step Guide to Innovative Disaster Recovery Finance 

incorporates lessons learned from past storms with traditional 
insurance and FEMA funding into a financial preparedness 
resource for GM&B municipalities. 

    The Resilient Land Use Essentials Guide is a resource for GM&B 

municipalities and land owners that facilitates planning for 
recovery from disasters caused by climate-induced flooding and 
sea level rise.

ZIKA ERADICATION: The Zika virus was successfully eradicated 
in 2017 when GM&B worked together with the state, federal, and 
community partners to proactively address the zika virus. 

AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM: Due to an introduction 
by GM&B, the Aids Drug Assistance Program partnered with the 
Infectious Disease Elimination Act (IDEA) Exchange to improve 
access to medication for mutual, low income patients. 

ADVANCING CITIES: Leveraging GM&B’s 100RC work, JPMorgan 
Chase awarded a $3 million dollar AdvancingCities Grant to The 
Miami Foundation in partnership with the City of Miami to address 
workforce development and small business expansion needs and 
opportunities.

A STORY MAP TO UNDERSTAND MOBILITY: A Story Map of 
current transit, transportation and land use types was developed 
as a communication tool to understand mobility and development 
prioritization. As a result of the story map, an ArcGIS Hub was 
purchased by Miami-Dade County during strategy development to 
enhance intergovernmental data sharing and transparency.

CITY WATER RESILIENCE APPROACH: A “one water” approach to 
tackling water specific issues was developed and adopted as a more 
resilient and holistic approach to managing water resources. This 
process allowed Miami-Dade County’s Water and Sewer Department 
to work more closely with Miami-Dade County’s Office of Resilience, 
GM&B municipalities, and regional organizations.

ACCELERATOR PROJECTS: Four projects were put through an 
intensive three-day development (‘accelerator’) process led by 
Colombia University and 100RC. The process was so successful that 
GM&B is committing to undertake future accelerator projects. 

When Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and the City of Miami 
Beach came together to form the Resilient GM&B partnership, 
Miami-Dade County and Miami Beach already had established 
Chief Resilience Officer positions and resilience priorities. With the 
support of 100RC, the City of Miami Beach created the CRO position 
and an Office of Resilience, and the three entities initiated a joint 
strategic planning process for long-term resilience. Through the 
Resilient305 Strategy development process this unique partnership 
has allowed for GM&B partners to collaborate and leverage their 
existing resources resulting in valuable achievements. Some 
examples include:

METROLAB AGREEMENT: Together GM&B partners and three 
local universities signed a City + University Collaborative called 
the Metrolab Network. This collaborative is a mutually beneficial 
relationship that drives urban innovation partnerships between 
these universities and GM&B municipalities to research, develop, 
and deploy technology-enabled solutions that can help address the 
community’s most pressing challenges. 

BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS PARTNER ACCESS: The City of Miami 
Beach’s Business Case Analysis contract allows GM&B partners to 
develop task orders and hire selected consultants to perform work 
outlined in the Business Case Analysis contract without having to 
perform traditional procurement procedures allowing for expedited 
workflow.

URBAN LAND INSTITUTE STORMWATER RECOMMENDATIONS: 
100RC funded an Urban Land Institute (ULI) panel that resulted in 
a series of recommendations specific for the City of Miami Beach’s 
stormwater program which are applicable to many of GM&B’s 
coastal communities and in many cases, are in the early stages of 
application amongst GM&B partners. 

RECOVERY RESOURCES: To evaluate post disaster response and 
recovery, GM&B developed three resources for use by additional 
governments and organizations:

    The Rapid Response Essentials toolkit strengthens 

intergovernmental coordination for post-disaster operations 
by providing guidance that supports improved analysis and 
evaluation of capabilities to recover and bounce forward after 
a disaster. The toolkit aligns with Miami-Dade County’s Post 
Disaster Redevelopment Plan (PDRP) and Comprehensive 
Emergency Management Plan.

Resilient305 Strategy and build 
on the Resilient305 movement.

RESILIENT305 
PROCESS

GM&B’s Resilient305 Strategy development process has been 
an extensive multi-year effort. GM&B has worked closely with 
100RC through two phases, with a third— implementation—still 
to come. Through the first phase GM&B reviewed and analyzed 
its resilience challenges alongside multiple partners, culminating 
in a preliminary resilience assessment. The second phase gave 
GM&B the opportunity to review priority resilience areas in more 
detail in order to establish realistic actions. 

Throughout this process GM&B has engaged thousands of 
stakeholders that reflect a wide range of expertise, ages, 
ethnicities, cultures, income levels and geographic areas to help 
shape the Resilient305 Strategy. This inclusive process allowed 
GM&B to work with residents and subject matter experts 
through community meetings, surveys and focus groups. As a 
result of this dialogue, GM&B has developed a communications 
plan and engagement toolkit for the implementation phase of the 
Resilient305 Strategy. 

As phase three begins, GM&B recognizes that implementing each 
of the actions within the Resilient305 Strategy will require a 
dedicated effort from a team that we call Progress, Innovation, 
and Vision for Our Tomorrow (PIVOT). The PIVOT team will 
oversee the prioritizing, implementation, and monitoring of 
progress on the Strategy. More information on PIVOT and how 
we are putting the plans to work can be found in the section 
called “Implementation.”

RESILIENT305 VISION

GM&B has organized the Resilient305 Strategy into three  
goal areas.

PLACES aims to address place-based challenges by:

    Enhancing climate resilience through design and planning;

    Creating, connecting, and improving mobility and housing 

options; and

    Safeguarding ecosystems.

PLACES

OBJECTIVES

PEOPLE aims to improve the lives of our residents 
everyday by:

  Enhance Natural Systems

    Supporting job and wealth creation; 

    Addressing specific health needs for the most vulnerable; 

and

    Preparing and empowering neighborhoods to anticipate 

and respond to disruptions.

PATHWAYS aims to enhance collaboration and 
committed leadership by:

    Setting common and equitable goals;

    Developing shared resources; and

    Working with our neighbors to succeed across boundaries. 

Each of the three goals of People, Places, and Pathways, has 
objectives that help organize actions within the goals. Many of 
the actions have case studies and spotlights that accompany a 
specific action to spotlight project examples and action leaders 
separate of the GM&B partnership. 

The actions build on existing efforts or address program and 
policy gaps to further resilience in the GM&B region.

DESCRIPTION
Since 2013, electric vehicle (EV) ownership in Miami-Dade County has increased by 
450percent. After California, Florida leads the country in number of registered electric 
vehicles; by 2030, Florida is expected to reach 30 percent market penetration. To 
prepare for and catalyze the growth of the EV market, GM&B will enact policies 
that support development of EV infrastructure (like chargers), seek opportunities to 
introduce EVs into municipal fleets, and engage in knowledge sharing to create best 
practices and a unified network.

One perceived barrier to greater deployment and use of EVs is an inadequate network 
of publicly available chargers. GM&B partners will pass legislation to require EV charger 
capability in newly built parking structures to set the foundation for EV infrastructure 
growth. Additionally, GM&B municipalities with existing EV policies and fleets will share 
their experiences and best practices with other GM&B municipalities to reduce potential 
concerns and issues. Collective commitment and investment is needed to facilitate 
an EV transition that will not only significantly reduce vehicle emissions but also save 
governments and residents operations costs.

CASE STUDY 
ELECTRIFYING THE FLEET
OBJECTIVE:  
CREATE MOBILITY 

In 2015, the City of Coral Gables began drafting its 
10-year Sustainability Management Plan to provide 
a framework on creating a more sustainable and 
resilient community. One of the goals established 
in the plan was to reduce gasoline and diesel 
fuel use 20 percent below 2013 levels by 2025. 
One way the City has focused on achieving this 
goal is integrating EVs into its City fleet. The City 
established an FY 2021 goal of 78 EVs, which 
represents 60 percent of their administrative fleet. 
The City purchases these EVs via a statewide 
procurement contract and has supported the fleet 
by installing dedicated EV support equipment at 
its maintenance facility, City Hall parking lot, and 
municipal parking garages. In 2015, the City began 
purchasing EVs and currently has a total of 43 EVs 
in its fleet, making it one of the largest government 
EV fleets in Florida. The City has been able to fund 
this through its annual vehicle replacement budget. 
The installation of 22 charging stations, with a 
goal of expanding to 43 by 2021, has enabled and 
inspired the community to start transitioning away 
from traditional gasoline powered vehicles.

RESILIENT305 STRATEGYOUR STORYA strength of the Greater Miami & the Beaches 
(GM&B) region is the diversity of our urban areas 
set next to uniquely beautiful and ecologically 
valuable natural areas, from the Everglades 
to Biscayne Bay to the ocean reefs beyond. 
Although our urban centers are booming, many 
of our residents’ struggle: the high cost of 
housing takes its toll as does transportation. 
Our burgeoning population, with its associated 
car ownership, can make journeys to work 
long and tiresome. Today those same features 
are vulnerable to tropical hurricanes and rising 
seas. While our natural environment is one of 
our greatest assets, it is at risk and changing, 
requiring our collective efforts to protect and 
adapt along with it. 
Through our “Places” actions, we aim to address 
these place-based challenges, enhancing our 
climate resilience through design and planning 
for the future; creating, connecting, and 
improving mobility and housing options; and 
safeguarding our ecosystems.

DESCRIPTION
Miami-Dade County is internationally recognized for its waters, being home to Biscayne 
Bay, a National Marine Sanctuary, numerous State of Florida aquatic preserves, and 
several water conservation areas. The Biscayne Bay wetlands project is a key coastal 
feature in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). To establish a 
framework for coordinating and collaborating among Biscayne Bay stakeholders—county, 
municipal and state agencies; academia; interest groups; and the general public—two 
parallel partnerships will be formed: (1) the Biscayne Bay Task Force, and (2) a peer-to-
peer network of natural resources managers. 

The Biscayne Bay Task Force will be composed of interdisciplinary and interagency 
members residing in GM&B, who are nominated and chosen by the Miami-Dade Board 
of County Commissioners. Its overall purpose will be to advise the Board of County 
Commissioners on issues related to the long-term preservation and restoration of 
Biscayne Bay water quality and habitat. The Task Force will prepare a Biscayne Bay 
Restoration Action Plan for the Commissioners that will identify problem areas, prioritize 
projects for Biscayne Bay, and provide recommendations for state and federal legislation, 
activities, and appropriations.

The peer-to-peer network of natural resource managers will be created from local 
GM&B municipalities, Miami-Dade County, and other governmental agencies across 
GM&B responsible for environmental initiatives throughout the Biscayne Bay watershed. 
The purpose of the network is to strengthen relationships and improve communication 
among natural resource practitioners, build capacity across the region, and coordinate 
efforts related to Biscayne Bay management that accelerate action and maximize impact. 
The network will share best practices and align multi-jurisdictional projects related to 
Biscayne Bay restoration at quarterly round table meetings. Additionally, the network will 
create a database that includes governmental natural resource managers from the area.

DESCRIPTION
The only barrier reef in the continental United States, the Florida Reef tract is the third-
longest coral barrier reef in the world, stretching 200 miles along the Atlantic Coast of 
South Florida. Its coral reefs are biodiversity hotspots. While these reefs cover only a 
small fraction of the ocean floor, they provide habitat for 25 percent of the world’s fish 
species. These coral reefs adjacent to GM&B warrant further protection and enhanced 
restoration as part of Resilient305. Miami-Dade County, which is responsible for 
managing its Artificial Reef Program, will collaborate with the Southeast Florida Coral 
Reef Initiative, local academic institutions, and coastal GM&B municipalities on continued 
implementation and in identifying opportunities for expanding this important program. 
Using leading science and proven intervention strategies, the Artificial Reef Program 
will seek to further enhance nearshore recreational benefits, provide additional habitat 
structure, and look for opportunities to further reduce storm-related coastal impacts. 
In conjunction with its ongoing beach nourishment program, Miami-Dade County will 
perform coastal modeling to determine the feasibility of using structures, such as 
submerged artificial reef material, to promote greater coastal habitat and shoreline 
resilience. 

Reefs are a $6.3 billion Florida economic driver supporting more than 70,000 local jobs. 
The health of the Florida Reef tract, which serves as a coastal buffer from wave energy 
and storm surge (Florida Department of Environmental Protection), has been declining 
sharply. In some areas, the state’s coral species have declined by more than 90 percent 
and some species have lost more than 97 percent of their populations (Mote Marine Lab). 
Currently, coral reef disease across the southeast coastal counties has impacted 20 of 
the 45 species found in Miami-Dade County.

DESCRIPTION
Beach nourishment provides essential economic, environmental, and recreational benefits 
to coastal communities. As the local sponsor for state and federal beach nourishment 
projects, Miami-Dade County manages its beaches, which are a vital buffer between 
coastal infrastructure and the impacts of wave action and surge during storm events. 
Miami-Dade County’s beaches are the very foundation of its tourism economy. In 2016, 
visitors to the GM&B region identified the beaches as the area’s best feature, and 77.5 
percent of those tourists went to the beach (Greater Miami Convention & Visitor’s 
Bureau, 2017). For every $1 that the federal government spends on beach nourishment, 
it receives $810 in tax revenue from tourists. Miami-Dade County will partner with U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers and collaborate with coastal cities to develop a comprehensive 
beach management plan that supports coastal sustainability and protection. 

The current 50-year federal authorizations for the Dade County Beach Erosion 
& Hurricane Protection Project (the Project) are set to expire in 2025 and 2038, 
respectively. Over the course of the next 2 years, Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami 
Beach, and other coastal barrier island GM&B municipalities will work with U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers on a $3 million feasibility study to prepare for reauthorization of the 
Project and the next 50 years of beach management. The feasibility study and future 
beach master plans by Miami-Dade County will provide further analysis and insight on 
domestic and non-domestic sand sources, and structural and non-structural solutions. 
The study will focus on identifying proactive strategies that help stabilize coastal 
beaches and minimize erosion to maximize investment. Miami-Dade County will seek 
to identify a dedicated funding source, a top priority for coastal municipal mayors, and 
blanket permits for GM&B municipalities to be more nimble as erosional hotspots arise.

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has allocated $158 million for beach nourishment for Project 
construction over the next 5 years, but Miami-Dade County will need to collaborate with 
coastal GM&B municipalities on identifying funding to continue implementing the beach 
management program over the next 50 years.

DESCRIPTION
GM&B partners will collaborate with local and regional partners to implement four green, 
blue, and hybrid infrastructure projects identified and prioritized during the Resilient305 
Strategy development phase for implementation. These projects were chosen because 
of the different habitat types they represent, and for their various resilience benefits, 
pioneering designs, regional significance, educational opportunity, and potential 
replicability. GM&B, with The Nature Conservancy of Florida, has prioritized these four 
projects to highlight primary environmental typologies in the region: 1) The South Dade 
Wetlands Project, supporting Everglades restoration; 2) the Indian Creek Living Shoreline 
Project, representing urban area wetlands habitat; 3) the Arch Creek Drainage Basin 
Project, representing urban area uplands habitat; and 4) the Julia Tuttle Causeway 
Shoreline Enhancement Project, representing Biscayne Bay habitat. Demonstrating 
the resilience benefits and lessons learned from these four projects will be important 
outcomes that will be used to inform similar future projects within GM&B and in other 
coastal communities. 

SPOTLIGHT

COLLABORATION WITH THE NATURE 
CONSERVANCY
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is an important local and regional partner, providing 
expertise on nature-based resilience efforts, and attracting funding and additional 
resources to the southeast Florida region. The Florida Chapter of TNC has been engaged 
with the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (Compact) since 2010, 
providing critical technical expertise and support for its nature-based policies and 
efforts, including leadership of the Compact’s Regional Shoreline Resilience Workgroup. 
The Workgroup’s products describe multiple community-engaged projects that are 
in development along urbanized waterways and coastal shorelines. These products 
provided important baseline information for GM&B’s Resilient305 Strategy development 
phase. This inclusive engagement process will further activate the community to 
better comprehend future flooding risks associated with being a coastal community, 
and to advocate for the advancement of green infrastructure across South Florida. It is 
anticipated that the TNC nature-based coastal resilience project funded by the Chubb 
Charitable Foundation, which started in late 2018, will also help inform the design and 
implementation of some of the four prioritized projects.

USING SCIENCE-BASED BENEFIT-COST ANALYSES TO 
OPTIMIZE FLOOD PROTECTION INFRASTRUCTURE

TNC works around the world, helping communities adapt to climate change through nature-based solutions such as restored reefs, 
mangroves, and wetlands that reduce the impact of storms and flooding. Starting in late 2018, with the support of the Chubb 
Charitable Foundation, TNC identified over a dozen potential locations in Miami-Dade County where natural and hybrid infrastructure 
could increase resilience to storms and rising sea levels. Science-based flood modeling and cost-benefit analyses were used to 
identify the optimal location where people and property could benefit most from a shoreline resilience project. The project is designed 
to increase flood protection and serve as a model for other parts of Miami-Dade County, other cities in the United States, and globally. 

Using a science-based approach that includes cost-benefit analyses allows restoration projects to be optimized for risk reduction 
potential. Working with institutional investors and other private-sector partners can promote investments in natural solutions; such 
entities can be an important complement to local governments. Identifying key steps, including performance data on natural assets, 
will make investing in nature as easy as it is to invest in traditional infrastructure. 

FROST SCIENCE’S MUVE INITIATIVE ENGAGES 
COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS IN RESTORING NATIVE 
COASTAL HABITATS

In October 2017, the Frost Museum of Science partnered with the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County, and received a $287,000 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Resilient Communities program grant, funded by Wells Fargo, to restore living shorelines on 
Virginia Key and in East Greynolds Park. This is the first of 100 coastal resilience demonstration sites within the GM&B region planned 
for the next 10 years. Coastal habitats are called living shorelines because native vegetation allays the impacts of sea level rise and 
climate change. For example, mangroves are adapted to salt water and their floating seeds can colonize new coastal areas, creating 
new habitat. Their stilt-like roots stabilize sand and slow down waves while keeping the plant above the water. 

As part of the project, the museum will be creating an original exhibition about sea level rise with the help of its Museum Volunteers 
for the Environment (MUVE). MUVE’s mission is to educate people about the environment while also empowering them to be proactive 
in protecting it. By acting together to help restore native habitats, MUVE volunteers are helping to create a more resilient metropolitan 
area. Since its inception in 2007, over 8,000 volunteers have restored 25 acres of living shorelines.

DESCRIPTION
Public parks and open spaces offer a large-scale opportunity to implement resilient 
design and innovative resilience measures at multiple scales simultaneously. GM&B 
will lead by example by using its own publicly owned park lands and open spaces 
to implement resilience best practices in three pilot projects over the next 5 years. 
Examples of resilience best practices that will be implemented include restoring living 
shorelines, increasing the number of park acres and open spaces, planting trees to 
mitigate increasing temperatures, using green infrastructure to manage stormwater, 
and restoring native habitat. Resilient park design simultaneously reduces physical 
vulnerabilities to environmental stressors such as flooding and the urban heat island 
effect while enhancing community health and resilience.

Using parks and open spaces as living classrooms and examples of resilient design 
provides a dynamic educational opportunity to the millions of visitors who use the parks 
each year. Innovative resilient design offers the thousands of school children who attend 
parks after school, summer, spring, and winter programs the chance to participate 
in living classrooms to learn about water resources, green infrastructure, and living 
shorelines, among other concepts. The parks can also serve as living laboratories for 
innovative resilience design and measures that lead the way for best practices such as 
Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) site planning guidelines.

At a larger scale, the Miami-Dade County Parks and Open Space Master Plan, 
implemented through the South Florida Parks Coalition, provides community and 
ecosystem resilience by creating an integrated network of parks, open spaces, trails, civic 
spaces, and streets that are pedestrian- and bike-friendly. The parks departments of the 
GM&B are proactively improving this network by strategically targeting land acquisition 
programs to support transit corridors; transition redfields to greenfields; reduce social, 
economic, and health disparities; improve east-west and north-south connectivity to 
provide a seamless park system; and enhance ecosystem and watershed connectivity.

USING SCIENCE-BASED BENEFIT-COST ANALYSES TO 
OPTIMIZE FLOOD PROTECTION INFRASTRUCTURE

Miami-Dade County’s Matheson Hammock Park is a mostly low-lying 630-acre park owned by Miami-Dade County located along 
the western shoreline of Biscayne Bay in the City of Coral Gables. It is one of the few publicly accessible waterfront areas in the 
southern portion of the County and the only one with beach access. The park floods during high tide events, which affects its normal 
operations and accessibility to the park; it is expected to be increasingly impacted by sea level rise.  

In 2018, Miami-Dade County funded a sea level rise flood mitigation study to help determine appropriate flood mitigation measures 
for different areas of the park. The study used the 2015 Southeast Florida Unified Sea Level Rise Projection, prepared by the Sea 
Level Rise Workgroup of the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. The study developed flood mitigation concepts 
for major infrastructure components within the park out to 2100. It provided a summary of existing conditions, conceptual solutions, 
a suggested implementation schedule for mitigation, estimated construction costs, and guidance for the planning and design phases 
of the mitigation concepts. Based on preliminary cost estimates, the proposed improvements are estimated to be $50 million to $55 
million between now and 2040. The mitigation concepts developed as a part of the study will be used in Miami-Dade County’s capital 
programming considerations for other parks.

RESILIENCE IN PARKS—JOSE MARTI PARK

The City of Miami is working with the Van Alen Institute, a nonprofit organization that works to catalyze positive change in cities, on 
a climate adaptive design of Jose Marti Park in Little Havana. The park is located on the Miami River and is susceptible to flooding 
during high tides and heavy rain events due to its current layout, which limits drainage. The goal of this project is to redesign Jose 
Marti Park to be an adaptive waterfront park that enhances restorative recreation, preserves cultural heritage, improves access to 
green space and the water, provides solutions to flooding in the short term, and will adapt to sea level rise in the future. The Van 
Alen Institute will lead a participatory design process and is paying local members from the community to help define and support 
outreach for engagement activities. The park design will be enhanced by interdisciplinary expertise that incorporates green and gray 
infrastructure, holistic measures of success, and inclusivity. The design will also seek solutions to increase storm surge protection and 
rain storm drainage for the surrounding residential community. Final design solutions will be used to inform and inspire future projects 
at sites with similar conditions (at or near sea level, near a body of water, and subject to flooding).

RESILIENCE IN PARKS—500-700 ALTON ROAD PARK

The City of Miami Beach is a geographically small and dense barrier island, with very few open spaces left for conservation or 
adaptation. In a rather unique move, the City Commission entered into a development agreement in 2018 with a local developer who 
will be creating the City’s first eco-park in exchange for development incentives that include increased building height allowances. 
The proposed 3-acre public park, funded by the developer, will include significant and measurable resilience and sustainability 
components, including:

  Open green space
  Florida-friendly native and naturalized plant materials that reduce 

water consumption and the need for fertilizer and pesticides

  Stormwater retention capabilities
  Infrastructure for treating water going to the 6th Street outfall
  Dedicated pedestrian paths

  Proposed integration and width of the perimeter sidewalks along 

West Avenue and Alton

DESCRIPTION
Protecting the areas along Biscayne Bay—known also as the “Back Bay” —from storm 
surge is much more difficult than protecting the ocean facing portions of the GM&B 
region because the essential tools of beach nourishment and dunes do not apply to 
Biscayne Bay. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is working with GM&B to identify appropriate 
protective measures that can reduce coastal flooding in those areas. To achieve this 
goal, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has launched a 3-year, $3 million Coastal Storm Risk 
Management Feasibility Study (CSRM) to explore measures such as upgrading the salinity 
control structures along the major canals to serve as storm surge barriers, acquisition of 
land in the floodplain, and/or restoration of mangroves and reefs. Ultimately, designing 
and constructing these measures could be eligible for partial federal funding if they are 
deemed technically feasible and cost effective. Reducing the risk of devastating coastal 
floods in the Biscayne area would benefit the entire GM&B region.

The Miami-Dade Back Bay CSRM will be coordinated with a multi-state coastal 
management strategy and the South Atlantic Coastal Study, also conducted by U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers. The study will conduct regional analyses of coastal risk and identify 
initial measures/costs that can address vulnerabilities with emphasis on maintaining or 
enhancing current levels of coastal storm risk reduction. This study will be coordinated 
with the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact.

DESCRIPTION
GM&B’s sea level rise strategy will identify implementable, financially feasible adaptation 
actions that its GM&B municipalities can use to better prepare for sea level rise and 
coastal storms. The Strategy will include an analysis of multiple adaptation pathways 
that will result in improved guidance on how to implement a flexible and adaptable path 
forward in the face of changing sea level conditions and the associated risks faced by 
communities across the GM&B region. Recommendations arising from this analysis are 
expected to be especially useful to local governments tackling these issues. 

GM&B’s sea level rise strategy will evaluate the economic cost of inaction and the cost of 
several alternative pathways, including a heavy reliance on gray or green infrastructure. 
GM&B will also identify short-term capital projects to be implemented by 2022 that 
will increase the area’s resilience to anticipated coastal flooding. GM&B’s Strategy will 
complement other on-going initiatives such as Miami-Dade County’s development of a 
sea level rise checklist for all County capital projects and other larger resilience efforts as 
highlighted in the County’s budget. The GM&B municipalities will be involved during the 
outreach phase of implementing the sea level rise strategy.

Miami-Dade County provides detailed and cutting-edge 
skills to public and private stakeholders through training 
sessions that include demonstrations of online tools to 
help identify at-risk assets. The training focuses on how 
to integrate sea level rise into planning and project design 
as well as on broader water and energy efficiency. These 
popular training sessions have included:

  Geographic information systems (GIS) training co-

sponsored with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) to provide technical inundation 
mapping skills to local government staff, students, and 
private consultants (attended by over 170 individuals).

  Sea level rise projections and application of those 

projections to existing projects (attended by 30 
transportation professionals).

  Benchmarking Training workshops to develop skills in 
analyzing County buildings’ energy and water use over 
time, including comparison to other facilities.

Miami-Dade County will continue to bring national and 
international resilience experts to the GM&B region and 
will work to expand outreach efforts, particularly to under-
resourced communities. Training offerings are expected 
to expand to meet demand, both in terms of attendance 
requests and topics that may arise in GM&B.

DESCRIPTION
The most cost-effective way to systematically protect infrastructure in the GM&B region 
is to integrate resilience considerations into the design of all new capital improvement 
projects as early as possible. In support of this concern, Miami-Dade County will develop 
a sea level rise checklist that compliments existing resilience training programs for 
capital planning. A previous study by engineering consultants found that an additional $6 
million investment in protective measures would prevent approximately $24 million in 
losses and protect Miami-Dade County assets worth more than $150 million. Additionally, 
if climate considerations are not integrated into design, key infrastructure may not last its 
entire design life and additional funds would be required to rebuild or modify the asset.

Miami-Dade County’s checklist will help ensure that new infrastructure is built to 
withstand future floods and storms and that there is a consistent approach across 
departments to integrate climate change considerations into project designs. A 
checklist and a clear process will help various departments adopt consistent standards, 
information, and the best practices for capital projects. Miami-Dade County will convene 
a working group with key departments responsible for the most critical infrastructure 
projects to test and refine the checklist format. Miami-Dade County is currently working 
to create an easy-to-use online tool that provides the data necessary to complete the 
requested information in the checklist, such as parcel-level information about elevations 
and flood risk. After developing the checklist, Miami-Dade County will share it with GM&B 
municipalities, along with best practices, so municipal partners can adapt it to meet their 
unique needs.

DESCRIPTION
To minimize costs associated with disruption, factoring risk from natural hazards (such 
as floods) into project designs is a must in a resilient coastal community. With high 
development pressures, especially in the urban core, affordability and displacement 
must also be addressed to stabilize the economy and citizen’s quality of life. Identifying 
concerns during the development review process and then modifying projects in the early 
design phase is typically the most cost-effective stage to adjust a project to improve risk 
reduction. GM&B will complete a Development Review Checklist and guidance document 
for GM&B municipalities to use in support of integrating resilience and equity into their 
development review processes. For instance, the City of Miami Beach has incorporated 
flood risk considerations into their land use board review processes as a decision-making 
tool for land use changes. The City of Miami has used the draft GM&B Development 
Review Checklist to review Special Area Plans and will integrate this resilience and 
equity review into their standard review processes to ensure that resilience is a 
consideration at the early stage of large development projects.

GM&B’s resource guide, with sample checklists and application questions for 
development reviews, will help other communities, especially those that are resource-
limited, incorporate resilience considerations into their design, planning, and development 
processes. This resource document will be a valuable aid in developing consistent 
standards, use of consistent information, and best practices for projects, and its use 
will facilitate decision making. Once completed, the guidance document will be shared 
through the Miami-Dade Planners Technical Committee.

RESILIENCE PRINCIPLES IN 
LAND USE DECISIONS

On July 26, 2017, the Miami Beach City Commission adopted an 
ordinance establishing criteria that the City’s four land use boards 
would incorporate principles to address and plan for the effects 
of sea level rise and climate change. Since its adoption, over 282 
items have been considered by the land use boards. The ordinance 
also includes separate criteria for the Planning Board when 
making recommendations on proposed amendments to the Land 
Development Regulations to the City Commission.

For new developments, applying the criteria means that climate 
adaptation and mitigation is considered during the review process, 
and subsequently at the land use board review. This process has 
encouraged robust dialogue between applicants and staff, informed 
the review process, and resulted in stronger designs. As part of 
an application for new development, applicants must address the 
criteria as part of their letter of intent to develop; as a result, new 
buildings in the City of Miami Beach are more resilient to extreme 
weather, more energy efficient, and increasingly adaptable to rising 
seas. 

Historic structures present a unique set of challenges since many 
were built below current elevation standards. The criteria encourages 
raising these structures. If that is not feasible, floodproofing must be 
applied.

DESCRIPTION
Potential shocks and stressors confronting the GM&B region need to be considered in all 
aspects of long-range planning. Therefore, resilience initiatives are addressed throughout 
each element of the Miami-Dade County’s Comprehensive Development Master Plan 
(CDMP). Mandated by state law, Miami-Dade County and its cities must regularly update 
their CDMPs and document progress in implementing CDMP’s goals, objectives, and 
policies. Updates to the CDMP’s maps and text are performed using the Evaluation & 
Appraisal Report (EAR) process. In 2019, via the EAR update, Miami-Dade County will 
include resilience as a central principle of the update. Updates will include promoting 
moderate- to high-density development along transit corridors in areas less susceptible 
to flooding, and strong protection of the natural systems that attenuate coastal hazards. 
The update will also address economic resilience, including provision of housing for all 
income levels. As GM&B municipalities update their CDMPs, templates for resilience 
components—such as those related to Florida’s Peril of Flood legislation—will be made 
available (via a new, online easy-to-use portal) to GM&B municipalities to adopt as 
relevant in their communities. 

The City of Miami and City of Miami Beach are actively incorporating policies into their 
CDMPs to increase their resilience. The 2016 CDMP for the City of Miami Beach’s EAR 
update improved policies related to stormwater management and designated the City 
as an Adaptation Action Area. The revised CDMP employs several strategies to ensure 
the City can adapt to sea level rise impacts by ensuring that the City provides protective 
infrastructure, accommodates anticipated future water levels, and manages and avoids 
development in high risk areas. Specific policies and strategies being considered include 
ensuring that new development adapts to the impacts of sea level rise; ensuring that 
greenhouse gas emissions are minimized; providing guidance for future infrastructure 
improvements to improve resilience; requiring additional study of the needs of historic 
structures; and addressing the needs of the City’s most vulnerable residents.

DESCRIPTION
Sixty-seven federally designated Opportunity Zones have been mapped in Miami-Dade 
County to revitalize economically distressed communities using private investments. 
Governments, not-for-profit organizations, and civic and private groups throughout 
the GM&B region need to collaborate to develop more holistic strategies to guide 
investments in Opportunity Zones, ensure achievement of resilient outcomes, maximize 
the outcome of anticipated investments, and avoid creating unintentionally negative 
consequences in communities. To accomplish these goals, Miami-Dade County, working 
with the Miami-Dade Beacon Council, has prepared an Atlas of Opportunity Zones 
throughout the County. The Atlas includes population and economic data for each zone 
and will be updated based on additional collaboration with GM&B municipalities and 
other stakeholders. The Miami-Dade Beacon Council and Miami-Dade County will perform 
outreach activities, in person and online, to inform elected officials, business owners, 
developers, investors, and others about the Opportunity Zones. In addition, Miami-Dade 
Beacon Council, assisted by Miami-Dade County, will create an investment prospectus 
providing potential Opportunity Fund investors with information on zoning, existing and 
planned infrastructure, and community goals.

The Atlas of Opportunity Zones was created in response to the Federal Opportunity 
Zone legislation, which creates favorable tax benefits for offering Opportunity Funds in 
designated zones. Federal regulations guiding investment in these zones by Opportunity 
Funds are being finalized. To yield maximum financial benefits, the private sector will 
be looking to make quick decisions on where to invest. The Opportunity Zone program 
presents an opening for community leaders to focus on resilient strategies and work 
with Opportunity Funds to achieve and accelerate broad-based outcomes. The Atlas of 
Opportunity Zones will facilitate use of the Opportunity Funds.

greenhouse gas emissions, reduce travel times, and refocus GM&B away from single occupancy vehicles.  

The SMART Plan when combined with newly established Opportunity Zones will further promote economic growth and job creation, as 
well as increase the region’s international competitiveness. The SMART Plan represents a vision for the region that is both strategic and 
far reaching, creating a system of multiple transportation options by leveraging existing infrastructure, and integrating technology at 
the highest levels. The plan is comprehensive, proactive, and supports the future population and employment growth anticipated in our 
region.

The SMART Plan will expand transit options in Miami-Dade County along six (6) critical corridors that are linked to regional, state, 
national, and global economic markets, as highlighted below. Another critical component of the SMART Plan is a network of Express 
Buses, known as Bus Express Rapid Transit (BERT), which will connect the SMART rapid transit corridors on limited access facilities, 
promoting the active  expansion  of  South  Florida’s  Express  Lanes  network.  The SMART Plan will be complimented by a SMART Trails 
Plan to expand accessnon-vehicular opportunities.

DESCRIPTION
Miami-Dade County will develop Mobility Hubs around current Metrorail, Metromover, 
and Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Plan Corridor stations. Mobility 
Hubs consist of physical improvements that seamlessly integrate different modes of 
transportation together. The Mobility Hubs will enhance the reach of the current and 
future transportation corridors including rail and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) stations. The 
program will include a design competition for current Metromover and Metrorail stations 
by the end of 2020 and will develop solutions for mobility providers to enhance service 
to and from mobility hubs.

Mobility Hubs are a crucial component of expanding access to surrounding neighborhoods 
that are serviced by rail and bus rapid transit (BRT). Traditionally, transit stations provide 
non-vehicle access within a ½ mile radius surrounding the station. Mobility hubs provide 
the opportunity to expand the reach of transit beyond this ½ mile and expand multimodal 
benefits to additional neighborhoods. Mobility Hubs will also provide opportunities 
to connect shared-use paths and other non-motorized facilities to the transportation 
stations and associated transit-oriented developments. The Mobility Hubs action is in 
alignment with the goal of the SMART Trails Program to identify and address First/Last 
Mile (FLM) connections. Improvements include:

  Technology to match trips from rail and BRT to bus, microtransit, transportation network 
companies, carshare, and other modes through connected real-time navigation through 
enhanced broadband 

  Dedicated space to serve “last-mile” options, including bus, microtransit, transportation 

network companies, and carshare

  Human-centered design to increase safe walking and biking trips

  Supportive infrastructure to encourage electric, non-polluting transportation options

  Permeable surfaces to reduce stormwater runoff 

Mobility Hubs have great potential to help transform the region and reinforce the policies 
developed with the current shared mobility work and will promote transit-oriented 
development.

THE UNDERLINE, A 10-MILE LINEAR PARK AND LIVING 
ART DESTINATION

The Underline is transforming the underutilized land below Miami-Dade County’s Metrorail, from the Miami River to Dadeland South 
Station, into a 10-mile linear park, world-class urban trail, and living art destination. This linear park will connect communities; improve 
pedestrian and bicyclist safety; create over 120 acres of open space with restored natural habitats; encourage a healthy lifestyle; 
provide an easily accessible place to exercise; create a mobility corridor that integrates transit, car, biking, and walking; provide a 10-
mile canvas for artistic expression; attract development along U.S. Highway 1; and generate significant economic benefit. Much like the 
High Line in New York City, the Underline will be open to all and provide amenities and art connecting people to place and each other.

Construction of the Underline will be done in nine phases. The first phase began in November 2018. The total construction and design 
budget for the first phase is $120 million, with over $90 million in public funds already committed. The Underline is led by Friends of 
The Underline, a 501c3, in partnership with Miami-Dade County, with additional support from the Cities of Miami, Coral Gables, South 
Miami, the State of Florida, and Florida Department of Transportation. Phased completion will be done as funding becomes available. 

GROWING GREEN BUS STOPS PILOT PROJECT

Growing Green Bus Stops began as pilot project created by Neat Streets Miami in partnership with O, Miami Poetry Festival. The 
project targeted unshaded bus stops along transit corridors throughout Miami-Dade County to mitigate the urban heat island effect 
and enhance the transit experience for riders. The project planted two canopy trees at 10 unshaded bus stops (20 trees total) located 
in different areas across Miami-Dade County. An additional component of the project was stenciling a haiku poem about trees, written 
by a local resident, onto the surrounding sidewalk. The resulting benefits were threefold: shade creation, beautification of roadways, 
and public engagement. The project demonstrated how communities can enhance the transit experience while cultivating more 
awareness about the benefits of trees through relatively small aesthetic and environmental investments.

The pilot project was funded from The Miami Foundation Public Space Challenge grant. Neat Streets Miami, housed in Miami-Dade 
County, is a multi-jurisdictional County board dedicated to the maintenance and beautification of transportation corridors, gateways, 
and connections.

DESCRIPTION
When it comes to public transit, Metrobus is the most heavily used mode of 
transportation in Miami-Dade. In 2018, roughly 50 million trips were taken on Metrobus 
alone. However, ridership has been declining. Transit Alliance (a local public transit 
advocacy nonprofit) will spend the next 2 years redesigning the Metrobus route network 
to create a more efficient and more cohesive public transit system. GM&B will support 
this effort through open collaboration, data, and staff resources.

The bus system is flexible and is the best candidate for short-term improvements that 
could have a major, positive impact on the use of mass public transit. Ridership has 
been in steady decline due to increased car ownership, trolley services without fares, 
longer bus wait times, unreliable service, and a poorly designed route network. This 
reconfiguration aims to improve service on highly frequented routes; create better 
connections to other bus lines, trolleys, and other modes of transit; and, design more 
logical and intuitive route paths. These improvements will work together to enhance user 
experience and bring riders back to Metrobus. Transit Alliance plans to recommend a new 
bus route system in late 2020.

DESCRIPTION
Driverless cars have much to offer, including the potential of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved using shared mobility 
services, vehicle electrification, and smart pricing while not undermining other emission-
reduction strategies. As part of the (Re)Defined Mobility project, Miami-Dade County 
will conduct numerous public workshops to determine which new technology tools and 
mobility options public and private transportation system customers are comfortable 
using. At the same time, demonstration projects will be conducted using autonomous 
vehicles (AVs) and on-demand transit circulators (hail on demand) to evaluate whether 
these technologies can be successfully integrated into the existing transportation system. 

The (Re)Defined Mobility project will bring residents of Miami-Dade County into the 
decision-making process and explore mobility solutions that match their needs. The 
project will work to: 1) develop citizen-centric solutions informed by participation in 
planning, design, and delivery of new mobility solutions; 2) experiment with new mobility 
solutions and technology with the deployment of AVs; and 3) create a digital interface to 
manage locations for AV drop-offs and pick-ups. 

Ultimately, the project will redefine the transportation planning process by helping 
to better understand the public’s sentiments toward mobility solutions and new 
technologies in Miami-Dade County. Additional benefits include reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions through vehicle electrification and increased occupancy of private and 
public vehicles, as well as improved walkability and equal access to all residents in the 
GM&B region.

DESCRIPTION
Since 2013, electric vehicle (EV) ownership in Miami-Dade County has increased by 
450 percent. After California, Florida leads the country in number of registered electric 
vehicles; by 2030, Florida is expected to reach 30 percent market penetration. To prepare 
for and catalyze the growth of the EV market, GM&B will enact policies that support 
development of EV infrastructure (like chargers), seek opportunities to introduce EVs into 
municipal fleets, and engage in knowledge sharing to create best practices and a unified 
network.

One perceived barrier to greater deployment and use of EVs is an inadequate network 
of publicly available chargers. GM&B partners will pass legislation to require EV charger 
capability in newly built parking structures to set the foundation for EV infrastructure 
growth. Additionally, GM&B municipalities with existing EV policies and fleets will share 
their experiences and best practices with other GM&B municipalities to reduce potential 
concerns and issues. Collective commitment and investment is needed to facilitate 
an EV transition that will not only significantly reduce vehicle emissions but also save 
governments and residents operations costs.

ELECTRIFYING THE FLEET

In 2015, the City of Coral Gables began drafting its 10-year 
Sustainability Management Plan to provide a framework for 
creating a more sustainable and resilient community. One 
of the goals established in the plan was to reduce gasoline 
and diesel fuel use 20 percent below 2013 levels by 2025. 
One way the City has focused on achieving this goal is 
integrating EVs into its City fleet. The City established a 
FY 2021 goal of 78 EVs, which represents 60 percent of 
their administrative fleet. The City purchases these EVs via 
a statewide procurement contract and has supported the 
fleet by installing dedicated EV support equipment at its 
maintenance facility, City Hall parking lot, and municipal 
parking garages. In 2015, the City began purchasing EVs 
and currently has a total of 43 EVs in its fleet, making it 
one of the largest government EV fleets in Florida. The 
City has been able to fund this through its annual vehicle 
replacement budget. The installation of 22 charging 
stations, with a goal of expanding to 43 by 2021, has 
enabled and inspired the community to start transitioning 
away from traditional gasoline powered vehicles.

DESCRIPTION
Miami-Dade County will work with local electric utilities and other stakeholders to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions within the GM&B region by implementing energy efficiency 
and conservation strategies, and by increasing production of renewable energy, battery 
storage, and similar energy storage systems and microgrids. GM&B will collaboratively 
implement strategies promoting solar cooperatives and national programs such as 
SolSmart that foster mature local solar markets. The City of Miami Beach has achieved 
Gold SolSmart status and Miami-Dade County has achieved Bronze SolSmart status. 
Miami-Dade County is working towards Gold status.

Uninterrupted access to reliable energy is critical to the GM&B region. Sustaining the 
region’s lifestyle requires a deliberate effort to increase efficiency, use alternative 
sources, and improve the resilience of energy systems. Implementing these strategies 
focuses on reducing carbon pollution and consequent heat waves, the leading cause of 
weather-related deaths in the United States.

DESCRIPTION
In Miami-Dade County, energy use in buildings accounts for 37 percent of the County’s 
energy use and climate pollution; these buildings waste an average of about 30 percent 
of their energy and water use due to building inefficiencies. To help mitigate these 
issues, Miami-Dade County, in collaboration with GM&B municipalities, will implement 
the Building Efficiency 305 (BE 305) program. The BE 305 program will promote more 
efficient buildings through initiatives that improve energy and water use in large, existing 
buildings, both private and public. The BE 305 program includes a variety of strategies 
including:

  Local governments leading by example through benchmarking and improving municipal 

building performance

  Promoting financing mechanisms, such as PACE, to assist building owners and managers 

make efficiency improvements

  Enhancing building performance through code compliance education and assessments

  Establishing building performance policies to include annual benchmarking requirements 

for residential and non-residential buildings 

  Facilitating community training and other educational opportunities focused on improving 

building performance 

The BE 305 program is an innovative approach that uses the deployment of building 
performance data to drive decision making and transform the marketplace. It aligns with 
Miami-Dade County’s vision to create jobs, enhance economic productivity, improve grid 
resilience, reduce the residential utility burden on low-income residents, bolster healthy 
and resilient communities, and initiate progress toward its resilience goals. The program’s 
focus is county-wide implementation in collaboration with GM&B municipalities.

This work is being completed as part of the City’s participation in the Connect Capital 
program, a 2-year initiative of the Center for Community Investment that assists 
communities in attracting capital at a scale to improve residents’ health and access to 
opportunity. The Connect Capital process has helped the City establish a shared set 
of priorities among diverse stakeholders with strengthened the policies and practices 
required to achieve the outcomes. The City is working with its private-sector, university, 
and nonprofit partners to meet an ambitious goal of creating or preserving 12,000 
housing units by 2024. In effort to meet this goal the City has identified key policies 
or regulations that needed to be created or modified (such as an inclusionary zoning 
policy being piloted in the Omni/Overtown area) and prioritizing the use of publicly 
owned land for new housing. Some non-policy priorities were also identified, such as 
improved coordination among regulatory bodies for permitting and collaboration with 
other governments, institutions, and nonprofits to leverage funding, financing, and/
or land. By July 2020, the City of Miami hopes to have adopted a new housing master 
plan. It is anticipated that the guidance document will be used to develop a coordinated 
interagency strategy and approach related to housing needs across Miami-Dade County.

DO YOU WANT TO LIVE IN 
A GARAGE?

With the future of driving and parking your own car 
in question, the City of Miami Beach City Commission 
adopted a parking garage convertibility criterion in 2016. 
Originally conceived to address workforce housing needs, 
it is an excellent model for adaptive re-use advanced 
planning. The City of Miami Beach is already seeing a 
decline in garage utilization and revenue, in part due to the 
car share disruption created by Uber and Lyft. The criteria 
for designing a parking garage that could be converted to 
future housing units include:

  Increased floor-to-floor heights (10 feet clear floor heights 

to accommodate future heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning (HVAC); plumbing; and electrical systems)

  Maximized flat area floor plates (keep circulation ramps 

outside main areas)

  Reduced vehicular ramp footprints to minimize future 

non-convertible areas

  Structural design to accommodate change of use 

(increased loading)

  Inclusion of vertical plumbing/waste chases or core for 

future use

  Potentially include larger elevator shafts to accommodate 

future cargo elevators

  Provide utility connection points for future use

Many variables apply when comparing costs of a traditional 
garage to convertible one - lot sizes. Zoning requirements 
and project scope can significantly affect estimates. The 
differential is in the 15 percent to 25 percent range. The 
City of Miami Beach is planning for two convertible garages 
in North Beach to meet today’s need and tomorrow’s 
reality.

DESCRIPTION
Miami-Dade County currently oversees 9,000 public housing units. The cost of renovating 
or replacing all units is $2.6 billion. To date, 2,400 units have been redeveloped, are 
under construction, or closing soon with a total development cost of $730 million. 
If the approximately 6,500 remaining units are redeveloped through demolition or 
new construction, the total cost would be approximately $1.9 billion. To help complete 
renovation or replacement of these units, Miami-Dade County was approved to redevelop 
these under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Rental 
Assistance Demonstration (RAD) plan. 

Miami-Dade County plans to issue nine requests for proposals for the 1:1 redevelopment 
of site-specific public housing contracts by December 2019. Developers will be required 
to follow the County’s Sustainable Buildings ordinance. Priority will be given to hardened 
buildings; elevated back-up generators to power common areas; use of solar power and 
hot water systems, when feasible; and those that ensure water and utility cost-burdens 
for residents are minimized. Ultimately, this redevelopment will help to fill the gap of 
pending renovated and updated public housing stock. Miami-Dade County has committed 
to maintaining the same rent for tenants returning to the redeveloped units. When 
stacked with additional financing incentives such as Opportunity Zones and opportunities 
for mixed-use development, redevelopment may even increase the number of public 
housing units available. Under the RAD plan, strict resident rights (such as resident 
notices and consultation, right-to-return after temporary relocation, and prohibition 
of rescreening of resident), relocation assistance, and other benefits allow for greater 
transparency. Implementation of the RAD planning process will be integrated into the 
Resilient305 when specific public housing sites are ready for redevelopment.

GOAL 1: PLACESGREATER MIAMI & THE BEACHES73

GOAL 1: PLACESRESILIENT305 STRATEGYA strength of Greater Miami & the Beaches 
(GM&B) is its diversity of people and 
neighborhoods, which are shaped by a myriad of 
cultures and characters. Although our economy 
is strong, many of our residents struggle 
because of the scarcity of living wage jobs, 
lack of opportunities for youth, and insufficient 
support for growing local businesses. The most 
vulnerable of our population are challenged 
by public health concerns, from mental health 
issues to opioid abuse to the threat of pandemics 
from climate change. Our neighborhoods and 
communities are not as connected as they could 
be, leaving some areas isolated when small 
day-to-day crises occur or big events such as 
hurricanes strike.

Through our “People” actions, we aim to improve 
the lives of our residents every day, whether 
sunny or stormy, by supporting job and wealth 
creation; addressing specific health needs for the 
most vulnerable among us; and preparing and 
empowering neighborhoods and networks to 
anticipate and respond to disruptions, both large 
and small.

With the goal of building long-term economic benefits in communities, Miami-Dade Beacon Council launched the Miami Community 
Ventures (MCV) initiative to connect low-income, structurally unemployed individuals to living wage jobs. The program specifically aims 
to aid individuals who are public assistance recipients, returning citizens, at-risk youth (19–29 years), or disabled, with female head-
of-households and veterans as sub-groups. Additionally, the program helps struggling residents overcome factors that may keep them 
from maintaining gainful employment by matching them with wrap-around support services in the areas of job training, child care, 
success coaching, education (with an emphasis on financial literacy), transportation assistance, and social services for up to 2 years. 
The MCV program is a model replicated from Michigan’s Community Ventures program. Miami-Dade Beacon Council launched the MCV 
pilot in partnership with Transitions, Inc., Goodwill Industries, and Lotus House in the neighborhoods of Liberty City, Overtown, and 
Goulds in the Fall of 2018. 

Miami-Dade Beacon Council’s ONE COMMUNITY ONE GOAL
In 2012, the Miami-Dade Beacon Council Foundation re-launched its OCOG strategic plan to provide Miami-
Dade County with a roadmap for future economic development success. The plan is based on the results 
of focus groups, surveys, and thousands of hours of community engagement conducted throughout Miami-
Dade County. Using this information, a professional research firm developed strategic recommendations to 
support significant job creation focused on increasing the number of higher-paying jobs. Industry leaders 
work closely with the education community to develop the proper curriculum for training required to 
support the growth of the targeted industries.

DESCRIPTION
GM&B is projected to have $320 billion in construction work in the next 10 years. To 
fully realize the economic benefits and ensure an adequate supply of qualified workers 
within the construction industry, GM&B will engage with Miami-Dade Beacon Council, 
Miami-Dade College, and other entities to convene stakeholders to address identified 
industry challenges for these low-barrier, high-demand occupations. GM&B will examine 
opportunities to leverage their local hiring requirements for construction-related 
contracts and encourage partner anchor institutions to do the same. 

As part of the Resilient305 Strategy development phase, GM&B engaged Fourth Economy 
to produce a research brief on the region’s workforce availability and training capacity 
in the construction industry. The research brief showed that the industry faces an 
impending labor shortage as experienced workers begin to retire, and the skills required 
for new construction evolve. Over 5,000 workers are needed to fill low-barrier, high-
demand occupations in construction, i.e., those that require limited training or education 
and are therefore a solid entry level path for workers to engage in the sector. Challenges 
include restoring the perception of construction and trade occupations as rewarding 
and lucrative career paths; developing local partnerships to create a trainee and job 
placement pipeline with high retention; and improving relevance of and participation in 
training programs, especially in the areas of new and adaptive construction materials 
and methods that focus on climate resilience and sustainability. The goal is to create 
and implement an action plan to better meet the labor force gap, and proactively 
engage with new populations by training and recruiting workers, particularly in under 
represented demographics.

GOAL 2: PEOPLEGREATER MIAMI & THE BEACHESMIAMI DADE COLLEGE
Miami-Dade College has the largest undergraduate enrollment of any college or university in the country and 
offers multiple programs relevant to the construction industry. The College embraces its responsibility to serve

TIMEFRAME: MID-TERM (5+ YEARS) 
DESCRIPTION
Currently, Miami-Dade County and the City of Miami Beach exercise fair chance 
hiring policies, commonly referred to as “Ban-the-Box,” which removes one barrier to 
employment for qualified workers with criminal records. GM&B, in partnership with 
community organizations focused on serving and/or advocating on behalf of returning 
residents, will promote the expansion of this policy to municipal hires across Miami-Dade 
County, starting with City of Miami. The City of Miami will write a draft ordinance that 
can be used as a roadmap for other GM&B municipalities to use.

The “Ban-the-Box” initiative aligns with the statewide “Voting Rights Restoration for 
Felons Initiative” approved in the 2018 election that aims to reintegrate residents with 
a criminal history. Fair chance policies promote a qualifications first approach to hiring 
by moving inquiries about arrest records to the final stages of employment, allowing 
candidates to be considered without stigma. Over the long term, GM&B, together with 
community partners, will advocate for anchor institutions and other private businesses 
to adopt fair chance hiring policies and inform them of benefits they can receive like the 
Work Opportunity Tax Credit. Implementing these practices at the municipal level will 
create local best practices that can be adopted by others.

DESCRIPTION
GM&B partners have established policies and programs that provide preference and 
support for buying and hiring from local businesses. GM&B’s strategy to expand 
opportunities for local businesses relies on anchor institutions as key partners in 
implementing the Resilient305 Strategy. Using information from past studies and 
forthcoming action items to be developed in the summer of 2019 by South Florida Anchor 
Alliance (SFAA) working groups, GM&B will provide participating institutions with a list of 
proposed high-impact actions to help catalyze “buy and hire local” actions in the region. 
GM&B will collaborate with the SFAA in developing a resource directory of minority-
owned, woman-owned, and local businesses and a resource guide for local businesses 
interested in pursuing contracts with local governments or other anchor institutions. 

SFAA is an initiative of the Health Foundation of South Florida, which requires addressing 
several associated factors, including economic well-being. This “Buy Local” action builds 
on the results of a study that examined barriers and opportunities for local institutions 
to engage in “buy and hire local” actions. The study was conducted in partnership with 
The Democracy Collaborative, a national leader in the field of community wealth building. 
Further, the action will be supported and supplemented with SFAA activities in the 
summer of 2019. SFAA will sponsor participation by procurement and human resource 
decision makers in working groups that will establish inclusive economy standards/
norms, procurement, and workforce strategies with clear activities and benchmarks.

DESCRIPTION
In preparation for the 2020 decennial census, GM&B will take a leadership role to ensure 
an accurate Census 2020 count by supporting outreach to hard-to-count populations, 
participating in Complete Count Committees, and identifying key messages and providing 
public education about the census and the importance of participating. A complete and 
accurate census is essential for proper federal representation and funding, as well as 
the creation of a data set that truly depicts our community. An undercount could lose 
GM&B millions of dollars of federal support for over 50 programs that support our most 
vulnerable residents, such as the Community Development Block Grant Program; roads, 
school programs, and lunches; Medicaid; and foster care. Outreach and efforts to ensure 
a complete count will be bolstered by Miami-Dade County’s Census 2020 Task Force’s 
action plan and the information gathered by the task force.

Based on the latest census estimates, approximately 430,025 people (16 percent) in the 
GM&B region live in hard-to-count neighborhoods, meaning that there was a lower-than-
normal return rate for census forms in 2010. The 2020 census, for the first time ever, 
will offer online response as the primary option to all respondents. The online option 
may increase response in some areas of the region but may provide a challenge for the 
roughly 23 percent of Miami-Dade County households that have either no internet access 
or dial up-only. Through outreach campaigns to build awareness and trust, GM&B and 
collaborators will make sure everyone has the opportunity to be counted.

DESCRIPTION
Approximately 59 percent of residents in the GM&B region and 70 percent of City of 
Miami residents live in “liquid asset” poverty, meaning they have insufficient funds to 
survive 3 months after a personal or natural disaster. These individuals and households 
are one emergency (such as a hurricane or flood) away from falling into debt or losing 
a home. Hurricane Irma, revealed the financial vulnerability of many residents in the 
GM&B region. To strengthen collective efforts to support financial health and stability, 
the United Way Center for Financial Stability will reconvene the Miami-Dade Financial 
Capability Collaborative quarterly meetings to seek innovative solutions for scaling and 
strengthening the Collaborative’s capacity and reach.

The Collaborative, including the United Way Center for Financial Stability, Catalyst Miami, 
Inc., and the City of Miami, aims to expand and improve service delivery and integration 
among dozens of local agencies that help low- to moderate-income individuals and 
families improve their long-term financial stability. Previously the Collaborative 
established standards of quality for financial coaching, tax preparation, and other 
financial stability services; set common metrics and data sharing through regular cross-
reporting; drove coordinated services to maximize access and utilization among Miami-
Dade County residents; and enhanced staff trainings to provide high-quality financial 
capability services. Building on these successes, the Collaborative will seek ways to 
strengthen their programs and identify new opportunities to support residents in the 
GM&B region.

DESCRIPTION
Children’s Savings Accounts (CSAs) are long-term savings accounts that provide 
incentives to help children and their families build savings for the future. Research 
indicates that low- to moderate-income children with savings of just $1–499 when 
completing high school are three times more likely to enroll in college and four times 
more likely to graduate. Funds saved in CSAs will be accessible upon high school 
graduation, which can then help pay for postsecondary education. GM&B will support the 
expansion of this program by encouraging other GM&B municipalities, anchor institutions, 
and private partners to support its expansion.

The CSA action is the result of a comprehensive planning process funded by The 
Children’s Trust, United Way, and Citi Community Development, and facilitated by 
Catalyst Miami, Inc.. From this planning process with key community stakeholders, the 
Future Bound Miami Consortium emerged with a vision of launching a universal CSA 
program, with a focus on building financial assets and post-secondary readiness among 
children from low-wealth families. The program will operate with financial support from 
both public and private funders. In addition to the initial seed deposit and program 
incentives, participating children and parents will also have access to free financial 
education provided by or through Catalyst Miami, Inc. and partners to build financial 
capability, including information on creating emergency family savings accounts. This 
program is scheduled to launch in Fall of 2019 in all elementary schools within the City 
of Miami (reaching a targeted 2,300 kindergarteners). In the second and third years, 
the program will expand to all elementary schools in Title 1 feeder patterns throughout 
Miami-Dade County, followed by all remaining elementary schools in years 4 and 5.

TIMEFRAME: SHORT-TERM (1-5 YEARS) 
DESCRIPTION
High school students often encounter barriers when trying to enter job markets that 
can inform their long-term career decisions. GM&B proposes expanding three existing 
programs that support Miami-Dade County youth as they leave high school: Big Brothers 
Big Sisters School-to-Work program; the City of Miami’s Summer Jobs Connect Program; 
and the Summer Youth Internship Program, a collaboration between The Children’s 
Trust and Miami-Dade County. These three programs currently serve approximately 
3,225 youth of the more than 75,000 eligible youth in Miami-Dade County. Two of these 
programs are only active during the summer season; a year-round expansion would allow 
more youth to be gainfully employed while attending school. 

These programs provide benefits to youth by giving them a greater understanding 
of financial management, real-world work experience, improved interpersonal 
communication skills, career choice advice and educational guidance, positive adult role 
models, connections for future career opportunities, resume building for future jobs or 
college applications, and interview practice. 

The Children’s Trust will lead this effort with support from Miami-Dade Beacon Council, 
Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, and governments involved with GM&B by 
encouraging and celebrating companies, anchor institutions, and GM&B municipalities 
that contribute to the programs financially, participate in career-based mentoring 
programs, and offer paid high school internships.

To ensure long-term resilience is relevant to long-term population shifts, GM&B will 
facilitate a review of Miami-Dade County’s Age Friendly Initiative (AFI) to identify 
opportunities for raising awareness about aging population and population shifts, 
understand implications related to long-term planning, and expand opportunities to 
engage with AFI. Examples of possible engagement opportunities may be assigning an 
AFI liaison (for updates and opportunities) to support governments, signing the Age-
Friendly Pledge/Mayor’s Challenge, or adopting “older adults in all policies” practices. 
Expanding age-friendly efforts is uniquely important in the GM&B region because of its 
culture of multigenerational living. 

In 2017, Miami-Dade County received official designation as a member of the global 
Network of Age Friendly Communities by Association of American Retired Persons

Miami-Dade County’s Social Services Master Plan (SSMP) creatively and comprehensively 
helps leverage and link Miami-Dade’s considerable investments in the areas of economic 
development, social welfare, housing affordability, education, and other health and human 
services systems. The SSMP was last updated in 2001. GM&B has identified updating the 
SSMP as a key action item as the strategies and issues in the plan are outdated. Miami-
Dade County allocated $200,000 in its FY 2018–2019 budget towards updating the SSMP 
and will work with GM&B and other social service stakeholders to attract the funding 
needed to complete a comprehensive review and update of the SSMP. 

The SSMP addresses social services challenges to give Miami-Dade County citizenry an 
overall snapshot of the issues and challenges, goals, suggested steps for strategic action, 
and targeted results and outcomes. As part of updating the SSMP, Miami-Dade County 
will look closely at the evolving challenges that GM&B communities face, including the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic, opioid use, and youth violence. The updated SSMP will consider 
Miami-Dade County’s community make-up, will assess how to best provide services, 
and will identify possible alignments with other community assessments, such as the 
Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process. As part of 
creating a holistic approach in the updated SSMP, Miami-Dade County will review what 
services can be integrated to avoid duplication and to best meet citizen’s needs in a 
comprehensive manner. An important consideration will be identifying linkages between 
people’s needs, facilitating access to needed services, and providing those services 
comprehensively based on individual and neighborhood-level needs.

COMMUNITIES

Live Healthy Community Partnerships (LHCPs) are collective impact initiatives funded by the Health Foundation of South Florida to 
strengthen a community’s capacity to collaboratively plan and carry out health strategies. LHCP launched in 2014, beginning with each 
community creating a community action plan that defined its health challenges and goals. This 6-year commitment is a strategic and 
systemic effort to reduce poor health outcomes by engaging community residents to improve public health indicators unique to each 
community. Two communities currently have funding: Little Havana and Miami Gardens. Each operates through its City government and 
is eligible for up to $3.75 million in funding to implement projects. 

Live Healthy Little Havana (Viva Saludable Pequeña Habana) aims to improve the health of this historic neighborhood by addressing 
social determinants of health with priorities in the public realm, education and employment, and housing. Past projects have focused 
on connecting community members with resources and services, increasing walkability and bikability, improving the public transit 
experience, and activating spaces for community recreation. Through the initiative, the City of Miami has developed a deeper 
understanding of and improved engagement with the Little Havana community and plans to use the lessons learned to scale the 
model to more neighborhoods throughout the City in 2020 and beyond. 

Live Healthy Miami Gardens’ goal is to improve conditions in the City of Miami Gardens to make it a healthier place to live, focusing 
on the following Health Impact Areas: alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; healthy eating and improved nutrition; mental health; 
physical activity; and primary health care. Past projects have focused on strengthening organizational-level practices and policies 
around physical activity and nutrition, reducing the stigma of mental illness and connecting community members to behavioral 
health resources, and encouraging the community to practice healthy behaviors. In 2018, the City of Miami Gardens was awarded an 
additional $3.4 million over 5 years from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention to continue this work.

CASE STUDY 
MOBILIZING FOR ACTION  
OBJECTIVE:  
CREATE MOBILITY OPTIONS
THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS

The Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process is a community-driven framework for improving 
community health. The process allows the examination of issues such as risk factors for disease, illness and mortality, socioeconomic 
and environmental conditions, inequities in health, and quality of life. MAPP is not an agency-focused assessment process; rather, it 
is an interactive process that can improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and ultimately the performance of public health systems. The 
MAPP process includes four community health assessments: local public health system, community themes and strengths, forces 
of change, and the community health status. These four assessments can help identify and prioritize health problems and facilitate 
planning and actions to address those problems. Facilitated by public health leaders, this framework helps communities apply strategic 
thinking to prioritize public health issues and identify resources to address them.

In 2018, the Consortium for a Healthier Miami-Dade began the assessment portion of the MAPP process, resulting in a list of challenges 
and opportunities that will be used by stakeholders to identify strategic health issues. By using MAPP, communities seeking to achieve 
optimal health can identify and use their resources wisely, considering their unique circumstances and needs, and form effective 
partnerships for strategic action.

individuals and society.  Greater Miami & the Beaches is home to the largest percentage 
of people with serious mental illnesses of any urban community in the United States. 
Yet, the State of Florida ranks near the lowest (48th out of 50) in per capita spending 
for publicly-funded treatment. Roughly 9.1 percent of Miami-Dade residents experience 
serious mental illnesses, however fewer than 13 percent of these individuals receive care 
in the public health system. 

To better inform funding requests, South Florida Behavioral Health Network, Inc. will lead 
on developing approaches to determine both the societal cost of our current inadequate 
mental health and/or substance use treatment options, as well as the economic benefits 
of increased investments in evidence-based treatment programs. System performance 
measures will be identified to measure return on investment and ensure accountability 
for resources allocated because of GM&B’s advocacy. In addition, advances in information 
technology and data analytics will be used to facilitate collaboration among providers of 
care and to ensure appropriate services are available when and where they are needed. 

This work will also help GM&B secure the resources needed to fully operate the Miami 
Center for Mental Health and Recovery, a first-of-its-kind mental health diversion facility 
designed to serve individuals who are frequent and costly reoffenders to the criminal justice 
system, homeless continuum of care, and acute care medical and mental health treatment 
systems. The facility, to be operated by the South Florida Behavioral Health Network, Inc., 
will offer a comprehensive continuum of mental health, substance use, and serve as a focal 
point in the community for the development and dissemination of best practice standards in 
clinical care, education, research, and community outreach and advocacy.

TIMEFRAME: IMMEDIATE (0-1 YEAR) 
DESCRIPTION
While opioid addiction is a growing epidemic throughout GM&B, the City of Miami, as 
the urban core and host of many social services, is a natural magnet for illicit drug 
users and transactions. Of the 5,404 drug-related arrests in Miami-Dade County during 
the first 6 months of 2018, 2,351 of them occurred within the City of Miami. In addition, 
it is estimated that 40 percent of Miami’s addict community is homeless. Through 
grant supported funds, Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and Jackson Behavioral 
Health Hospital (JBHH) recently launched a first-of-its kind arrest diversion program for 
individuals identified by police officers as having felony possession of opioids for personal 
use. This program is a major step forward, serving about 100 individuals a year over 3 
years, but it will not produce enough new treatment capacity to help everyone in the 
throes of opioid addiction. Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and JBHH will seek 
additional support to provide more treatment capacity at JBHH and more dedicated long-
term housing.

This arrest diversion program is based on the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion 
program in the Seattle area, but is unique in its ability to legally bind participants, via 
voluntary opt-in, to direct substance abuse and mental health treatment services without 
having them enter the criminal justice system. Individuals who choose to participate in 
the 12-month treatment program sign a binding treatment agreement that admits them 
to JBHH for medically supervised withdrawal and medication assisted treatment, as well 
as mandated therapy and individual case management. If expanded, this arrest diversion 
program could be made available to other GM&B municipalities.

DESCRIPTION
Miami-Dade County has the highest rate of new HIV/AIDS infections of any city in the 
United States, with one in 85 adults living with HIV/AIDS. In September 2016, the Office 
of the Miami-Dade County Mayor, the Miami-Dade HIV/AIDS Partnership, and the Florida 
Department of Health established the Miami-Dade HIV/AIDS “Getting to Zero” Task Force 
as a means of mobilizing resources and expertise throughout the Miami-Dade community 
in a concerted effort to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Task Force established a 
set of 16 strategic action recommendations aimed at addressing this major public health 
issue in a culturally competent manner, given Miami-Dade County’s large immigrant 
population, and the entire spectrum of HIV/AIDS issues. GM&B will help advance progress 
of this Strategy by engaging the entities and individuals championing broader, regional 
recommendations and creating connections with governments and key institutions 
to expand impact. Partnerships and actions will be informed by determining where, 
geospatially, HIV/AIDS is being transmitted and where those living with HIV/AIDS reside 
to make response as place-based as possible. In addition, the Florida Department of 
Health and stakeholders will align tactics with the National HIV strategy, “Ending the HIV 
Epidemic: A Plan for America.”

ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

The Resilient305 action development process included obtaining ideas from the Founder and Medical Director of Infectious Disease 
Elimination Act (IDEA Exchange), Florida’s first authorized syringe exchange program, as to how to reduce HIV incidences among people 
who inject drugs. 

Resilient305 was able to connect the IDEA Exchange, whose focus is HIV prevention and linkage to care and treatment, to the Florida 
Department of Health to discuss how IDEA Exchange patients can reduce their viral load. One method is improving medical compliance 
by referring clients to and streamlining enrollment in the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), which serves those with incomes 
below the federal poverty level and who are unable to afford antiretroviral medications. In addition, IDEA Exchange was informed 
about third-party prescription pickup and was authorized to pick up medication for seven of their clients, removing a barrier to medical 
compliance. In fact, IDEA Exchange stated that they “feel certain that this process is essential for keeping these clients compliant 
with their treatment.” Through closer cooperation and communication, ADAP and IDEA Exchange have been able to better serve their 
common clients, taking advantage of the services already in place.

DESCRIPTION
The Zika Virus detected in Miami in 2016 was most likely brought to the region by 
unknowing travelers. GM&B was the first community experiencing the Zika virus known 
to successfully eradicate it and break the chain of Zika transmission, but the outbreak 
did reveal gaps in collective action and preparedness to deal with new pandemic threats. 
GM&B will work with the state and local Departments of Health, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, and other necessary stakeholders to reevaluate pandemic risks 
and determine how to continue to improve collective response in the case of a disease 
outbreak. 

Going forward, climate change, urban densification, and globalization will all increase the 
GM&B region’s vulnerability to disease pandemics. Miami’s biodiversity and climate make 
it a hotspot for species that can carry and transmit viruses to humans (e.g., mosquitoes, 
bats, birds). In addition, high volumes of travelers, both domestic and international, put 
Miami at risk for disease interception. Pandemic threats can have broad, intersectional 
impacts, such as the economic impacts that came because of Zika. Other areas of 
potential impact could be tourism interruption, stress to existing healthcare systems 
due to patient surges, worker absenteeism, and mistrust of public infrastructure such as 
public transit. Assessing the current readiness status of GM&B will assist communities 
in determining resources and planning needs during a pandemic. Determining ways 
to improve community-wide immunity as well as identifying trigger points to activate 
pandemic response are crucial for preventing and addressing disease outbreaks. As a 
global community, GM&B must be ready to fight pandemics not only to protect residents 
but also to improve global immunity.

ZIKA—FROM SHOCK 
OBJECTIVE:  
CREATE MOBILITY OPTIONS
TO STRESS

In August 2016, the Florida Department of Health (FL-DOH) confirmed two local Zika transmission zones: one in the Wynwood 
neighborhood of the City of Miami and the other in Miami Beach. This type of shock was new for the region and the two municipalities, 
along with Miami-Dade County, mobilized quickly with the assistance of state and federal partners. Internally, each entity pulled 
expertise and directed action across multiple departments; this was not an issue one department could take on its own. Daily calls 
with the FL-DOH, County, and surrounding jurisdictions took place to discuss mosquito trap counts, health-related information, and 
deployment strategies. 

Staff canvassed the designated Zika Transmission Zones to identify mosquito breeding conditions, remediate concerns, and educate 
residents and businesses on ways to “Drain & Cover” and “Fight the Bite.” Resident outreach was key during this event as residents 
needed to feel informed and confident in the government response to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in cleanup and mitigation 
efforts. Standardized messaging, written in pamphlets and other materials, was sent and handed out Countywide to ensure the same 
information was provided to the public. 

This collaborative approach was highlighted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a “best practices” model to build on 
for other municipal and county entities. Moving forward, the potential for mosquito-borne illnesses is a stressor that will be monitored.

DESCRIPTION
The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) Program empowers communities 
and educates residents about disaster preparedness for hazards that may impact their 
area and trains them in basic disaster response skills, such as fire safety, light search and 
rescue, team organization, and disaster medical operations. There are near 5,000 trained 
CERT volunteers in Miami-Dade County. Miami-Dade County will work together with 
GM&B municipalities to GIS map and identify CERT gaps within GM&B to facilitate CERT 
programs, coordinate CERT teams, and provide training to CERT team leaders. Municipal 
CERT coordinators will identify high-need communities to place trainings and recruit 
where most needed. Miami-Dade County will maintain a master list of CERT-trained 
volunteers. In addition, Miami-Dade County will offer more diverse training opportunities 
(CERT+) for CERT trainees to allow them to expand their skillset. 

Using the training learned in the classroom and during exercises, CERT members can 
assist others in their neighborhood or workplace following an event when professional 
responders are not immediately available to help. CERT members also are encouraged 
to support emergency response agencies by taking a more active role in emergency 
preparedness projects in their community. Increasing the number of CERT volunteers in 
the County and helping them organize into teams will increase neighborhood resilience 
and help build a culture of preparedness.

CERT PROGRAM

The West Coconut Grove CERT team plays a critical role in the resilience of its neighborhood and serves as a model for future CERT 
teams. Led by a former City of Miami firefighter, the team is the County’s largest and most active CERT team; it doubled its size between 
2017 and 2018. The team meets once a month to maintain readiness. Its organizational structure, combined with its integral community 
connections, led to its highly successful first major deployment, responding to Hurricane Irma. 

The week before the storm, members of the team met to divide their neighborhood into walkable areas so they could hand out storm 
preparation information and identify residents who were not evacuating. In conjunction with the Thelma Gibson Health Initiative, the team 
created a list of individuals who might need electricity for medical purposes as well as food and water to check on after the storm.

After the storm, the team got right to work. A designated central dispatcher coordinated communications and fed information from team 
members on the ground to support entities, as needed. In addition to door-to-door activity, the team also worked with local supermarkets 
and restaurants to fill the five local food banks and activate volunteers to help cook for hungry residents.

American Red Cross, and other partners. As of March 2019, there were over 1,200 
volunteers registered to serve in the GM&B region. By June 2019, United Way will launch 
an additional upgrade to the portal that will allow GM&B municipalities and community 
organizations to post and promote volunteer opportunities in the GM&B region for 
disaster-related volunteer activities. The expanded capability will also streamline the 
processing of background checks. 

Before hurricane season each year, United Way will kick off the season with a volunteer 
opportunity to help residents get prepared for the upcoming hurricane season. GM&B 
partners will support this action by promoting the volunteermiami.org portal to their 
residents and community-based organizations and by using the portal as a resource for 
their own volunteer needs.

DESCRIPTION
The City of Miami will partner with public and private organizations to develop outreach 
content and events to assist property owners to understand their vulnerability to flooding 
and their options for reducing that risk. Information will be prepared and delivered in a 
manner that is easily digestible using the best available data. Given the unpredictability 
of future conditions, the City of Miami intends to communicate known uncertainties while 
still providing actionable solutions. Information on a variety of flood protection methods 
appropriate for different time horizons and budgets, along with options for financing, will 
be created and made available. Not only will this information be available online, it will 
be disseminated through workshops and outreach events throughout the City.  

The goals of this action are to improve residents’ preparedness for flood-related 
incidents, increase citizen’s confidence in their ability to adapt to changing environmental 
conditions, and strengthen the lines of communication between local governments and 
residents. These outreach efforts also provide the opportunity for local governments to 
communicate local actions taken to address flooding (e.g., raising roads, installing pump 
stations, enhancing green infrastructure). 

The City of Miami will determine the best mechanisms for keeping the distributed 
information up to date and will document the results of these tools and events to share 
best practices with GM&B municipalities.

Throughout Miami-Dade County, local governments and non-profits alike have been 
working towards improving connection and access to information and services that are 
vital to community building and personal resilience. To achieve this, a local community 
advocacy and empowerment organization, Catalyst Miami, Inc., has started to work 
with governments and community members to develop “resilience hubs” in five target 
communities: Hialeah, Homestead-Naranja, Little Haiti, Miami Gardens, and Overtown. 
GM&B will support and embrace the establishment of resilience hubs and will determine 
how to integrate operations across the region to best serve communities. An important 
aspect of the resilience hubs will be to establish clear communication pathways during 
disaster events to ensure community needs are met.

Resilience hubs will serve a crucial role in disaster preparation and response, but they 
will also operate year-round. They will offer connections to government initiatives, as 
well as their own programming and supplemental social services. Catalyst staff will 
serve as supplemental community liaisons and help entities connect with the individuals 
they serve. The model built by these resilience hubs can be replicated widely and used 
to address every neighborhood’s unique resilience challenges.

In the GM&B region, we want resilience to be more than a word. We seek to create 
a culture, behavior, and a way of being that incorporates resilience. The concept of 
resilience is complex— the term is wide-reaching and means different things to different 
people. The GM&B seeks to create an emotional understanding and connection to 
resilience through the arts. The region is home to a vibrant and strong artistic world, with 
more than 16 million people attending cultural events each year. The GM&B can build 
on the presence of this artistic world to increase resilience by visually and emotionally 
connecting with people of all ages across our diverse cultures and neighborhoods.

GM&B will support several organizations in creating visuals—infographics, photos, and 
short video vignettes—to explain resilience in all its facets. These visuals will be created 
in a form that can be easily shared through multiple channels, from social media to 
church programs. The content of the visual will be appropriate for multiple audiences, 
including governments, community organizations, schools, and other venues. The visuals 
will be created by local artists and will rise organically in response to local resilience 
challenges and solutions. 

GM&B will support the work of the Miami-Dade Cultural Affairs Department to 
host a public art contest to provide a non-predictable, perhaps controversial view 
of Resilient305. The winning materials from this contest will be added to the suite 
of “resilience visuals” available for use throughout the GM&B region. If successful, 
this contest could become an annual contest. Possible funding sources may include

at Collins Park (2100 Collins Avenue). From October 28 through November 17, Misael brought together City staff and community 
volunteers to fill and build in three sections an amphitheater using over 11,000 sandbags. The installation hosted diverse programming 
at each stage of its construction. Programming included panel discussions on Miami Beach’s history and environment, films, poetry, and 
music. All programming used the theme of sand as a jumping off point and lens to better understand the past and future of the city. 

Misael’s creative practice is engaging the community in new and innovative ways and is creating new avenues for dialogue and 
exchange around the challenges faced by the City of Miami Beach. Projects such as “Sand Amphitheater, Theater, Arena” bring 
together a diverse group of stakeholders that are engaged through active participation in the actual installation’s construction and the 
programing.

GOAL 2: PEOPLERESILIENT305 STRATEGYA strength of the Greater Miami & the Beaches (GM&B) 
region is our understanding of the power of collaboration. 
We have seen its success in the Southeast Florida Climate 
Change Compact and our joint participation in the 100RC 
Resilience Accelerator initiative. The actions described 
in the Resilient305 Strategy pave the way for increasing 
efficiencies among all 34 cities and county as we unite in 
tackling the shocks and stressors we share, from flooding 
to major hurricanes. The challenge is to make sure that 
staff and leaders across the GM&B municipalities have 
both an understanding of the breadth and depth of our 
challenges and the tools needed to address them. 
Through our “Pathways” actions, we aim to build the 
connections, collaborations, and committed leadership 
needed to change the status quo, enabling GM&B to 
become a global leader in resilience. We can achieve this 
by setting common goals, and committing to actions that 
bring together governments, businesses, and academic and 
community organizations.

DESCRIPTION
Disaster recovery can be a long process with the success and timeliness of the efforts 
being partially dependent on quality pre-planning. Recovery efforts begin immediately 
after the disaster/shock, with actions and programs being set in motion, setting the 
stage for a long-term recovery for which the entire community is already prepared.

In 2018, GM&B developed the “Rapid Response Essentials” toolkit to foster better 
intergovernmental coordination for response and recovery actions. The toolkit is aligned 
with the County’s recently updated Post Disaster Redevelopment Plan (PDRP) and 
is an appendix to the County’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. GM&B 
encourages cities to use the plan’s guidance to analyze their capability to recover or 
bounce forward after a shock and, if appropriate, create their own tailored version of the 
toolkit. 

The toolkit:

  Provides awareness of what government response is and helps to clarify responsibilities

  Spells out steps to set up for a recovery process that supports a rapid bounce forward 

  Creates a network of trained and prepared recovery staff

  Builds bridges to other segments of the community, including businesses and the most 

vulnerable

  Provides a roadmap of critical path to recovery for whole community

DESCRIPTION
Disaster preparedness is a strength of the GM&B region. The region has learned from 
history, having experienced disasters, but these risks have strengthened our emergency 
management preparation and response systems. To advance financial recovery, 
lessons learned from past storm events have been transformed into a simple and short 
5-Steps to Innovative Disaster Financing guide to complement traditional insurance 
and FEMA funding for recovery in GM&B municipalities. This guide focuses on financial 
preparedness to recover faster after an event. Cities conventionally rely on traditional 
indemnity insurance and FEMA reimbursements, but this is often not enough to cover 
all the damages and service needs. It is also cumbersome and often takes too long. The 
guide describes a cohesive interdisciplinary team approach to examine current insurance 
coverage, financial risk, bond ratings, and economic drivers. The guide includes a list of 
financing options for recovery, and their benefits and drawbacks. The guide also provides 
information about parametric insurance, prepared by SwissRe, a 100RC Platform Partner. 
The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) 
will expand the use of the 5-Steps Guide with its member cities, highlighting it as a 
resource and topic for conferences.

GM&B region that contains recommendations for land use actions that local governments 
can implement before a disaster to facilitate post-disaster recovery and potentially 
minimize negative impacts, particularly in the face of climate-induced flooding and sea 
level rise. In this context, land use planning refers to rules and guidelines governing 
the disposal of public and private land to promote the physical security of urban 
communities. The guide is intended for every city planner, with notice to the city 
manager and emergency manager. GM&B lead planners will share, present, and facilitate 
dialogue at local collaborating venues.

TIMEFRAME: IMMEDIATE (0-1 YEAR) 

DESCRIPTION
Plans and strategies tend to sit on the shelves unless they are operationalized and 
actively put into use. It is critical for all 34 GM&B cities and the county to be motivated to 
adopt resilience policies at the governance level, and take action at the staff operational 
level. To accomplish this, Miami-Dade County will collaborate with GM&B partners to host 
an intensive 1-day workshop every January for the next 3 years. The boot camp is geared 
to newly elected and re-elected local municipal elected officials and is intended to grow 
our leadership commitments beyond mayors. Participants will be introduced to theory 
and practice of the Resilience Accelerator approach. They will be coached by experts and 
inspired by 100RC network mayors experienced in implementing strategies. Local and 
regional resources will also be shared. Participants will leave with the tools, tips, tricks, 
and relationships to operationalize the Resilient305 Strategy and support their CROs in 
action and implementation. Participating cities that commit to creating or identifying a 
CRO in their city would be able to participate in Action 46: Resilient 35 in the 305.

DESCRIPTION
Miami-Dade County will catalyze the resilience work across Miami-Dade County 
by providing peer exchange and connecting local government practitioners through 
the planned Resilient 35 in the 305 Network. The 305 Network will facilitate 
intergovernmental collaborative work among practitioners by enhancing and supporting 
the sharing of communication and resources between cities in Miami-Dade County 
to advance resilience work. The 305 Network will support its member cities in their 
resilience work, develop multi-city collaboration projects, influence the development 
of policies at the local and regional level, and build a network of trusting relationship 
between peers. To participate in the 305 Network, cities commit to creating a CRO 
position or identifying a person responsible for CRO duties.

305 Network members will be able to transfer knowledge learned from their peers to 
their own work and thereby synergistically advance resilience within their municipality. 
Through the 305 Network, GM&B municipalities will be able to leverage resources 
to become better prepared to overcome the shocks and stressors the region faces. 
For example, the City of Miami Beach has made significant strides in stormwater 
management, land use changes, and creative procurements. The City’s lessons learned 
and resulting products will be made available to 305 Network member cities to modify 
and inspire their own work. By participating in this local network, including the elected 
official bootcamp (Action 45, Send your boss to bootcamp) and the online training, GM&B 
municipalities in the GM&B region are truly making strides towards resilience.

SPOTLIGHT

LOCAL MITIGATION STRATEGY
Miami-Dade County’s Local Mitigation Strategy (LMS) is a 
whole-community initiative designed to reduce or eliminate the 
long-term risk to human life and property from hazards. Established over two decades 
ago, the LMS is a comprehensive approach to effectively reduce the impact of current 
and future hazards and risk faced by communities within Miami-Dade County. The LMS 
is a compendium of efforts of the whole community, integrating governmental and non-
governmental agencies such as non-profit, private sector, educational and faith-based 
organizations as well as communities, families and individuals.

In addition to preparing residents for the potential impacts of various types of natural 
hazards, the LMS is critically important because it satisfies Miami-Dade County’s 
mitigation plan requirement under Section 322 of the Stafford Act as enacted under the 
Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 and enables all jurisdictions that participate in the LMS 
to be eligible for federal hazard mitigation grants in the event of a declared disaster. 
To remain current and vital, the LMS is updated annually and the LMS Committee holds 
four meetings yearly. Additionally, the LMS plan undergoes a complete state and federal 
review and approval every 5 years by Florida’s Department of Emergency Management 
and FEMA, and is ultimately adopted by local elected officials.

existing work and service delivery. The City of Miami Beach will pilot online resilience 
training for all employees and make the material available to the GM&B municipalities to 
enable them to adapt it to their own training programs. 

By using eLearning platforms, cities can create custom learning experiences that engage 
learners through interactivity and collaboration. These systems are available 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year for any department and any shift. Effective 
rollout will include determining which courses are appropriate for learners. The City 
of Miami Beach will work with experts to develop content and build courses that may 
include a PowerPoint presentation, video vignettes, and/or a mastery component. 
Each government entity can further customize the resilience training with city-specific 
information and can work with their internal training coordinators to determine who 
will be required to take the courses, assign them through the eLearning platform, and 
determine the frequency of the refreshers.

100RC TRAINING FOR LOS 
ANGELES

As part of the effort to spread the impact of Resilient 
Los Angeles and to implement its priority initiatives, 
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti signed an executive 
directive instructing many City departments to designate 
Departmental Chief Resilience Officers (DCROs) who are 
tasked with integrating resilience priorities across each 
arm of City operations, programs, and policy. With its 
diversity in expertise and thematic interest, this group is 
a critical resource for mainstreaming resilience thinking 
in Los Angeles. By significantly expanding the number 
of resilience champions in Los Angeles and paving the 
way for new kinds of cross-departmental partnerships on 
resilience initiatives, the group also sits at the forefront of 
Resilient Los Angeles implementation.

To support these efforts, 100RC partnered with the City of 
Los Angeles to conduct in-depth collaboration sessions for 
the DCROs in November 2018, focused on project financing 
and frameworks for implementation and evaluation to 
further advance resilience work. The interactive workshop 
not only equipped the DCROs with new methods and tools 
to design and implement projects with resilience benefits, 
but also empowered them to directly apply these practices 
with the aim of building resilience capacity among 
departmental staff and City stakeholders.

municipalities will leverage the City of Miami Beach Resilient Integrated Strategic 
Engagement (RISE) Guide to ensure strong and consistent messaging that increases 
awareness and helps shape the narrative around resilience. The purpose of this 
action is to provide cities with new tools and resources to engage and dialogue with 
the communities of today about the vision for tomorrow. Communicating purpose, 
customizing products, and coordinating processes are the basis of a core framework that 
any city can use.

The City of Miami Beach created its RISE Guide out of a need for consistent and 
transparent city messaging surrounding the Miami Beach Rising Above stormwater and 
climate resilience programs. Cities can tailor this guide for their own use. The facts, tips, 
and training in the RISE Guide will empower staff in community dialogue, improving the 
public’s trust and faith in city adaptation actions. Tools like the RISE Guide are essential 
to break down silos, build knowledge of resilience, and arm communicators and all 
departments with the information they need to speak with the community.

Science is complex, evolving, and critical in adapting to sea level rise and climate change. 
Florida International University’s Sea Level Solutions Center will lead an Actionable 
Science Advisory Panel (ASAP) to make it easier for GM&B municipalities to use the 
best available science to inform planning and decision making associated with resilience 
efforts at the local government level. 

ASAP’s priority will be to provide data driven recommendations and best available 
science on locally appropriate standards and projections regarding future rainfall 
and temperature patterns, sea level rise, and groundwater levels. These projects are 
particularly important to the GM&B region because of the anticipated effects of climate 
change on regional hydrology and water management systems. ASAP will also be an ad-
hoc resource to GM&B, helping to support Action 53: Share Bold Integrated Water Models 
made up of GM&B municipalities working in the modelling and infrastructure fields. ASAP 
will include interdisciplinary experts from multiple universities and colleges. ASAP’s work 
will coordinate with and complement the work of the Southeast Florida Climate Change 
Compact and the Florida Climate Institute.

This action is derived from the Urban Land Institute’s examination of City of Miami 
Beach’s stormwater program, which resulted in suggestions that local science be used 
to provide recommendations about strategies and investments from a 30- to 70-year 
horizon. The Urban Land Institute also recommended new strategies for benchmarking to 
accommodate increased future risk and the changing climate.

implementing affordable housing and climate adaptation projects. 

In August 2018, 100RC and Columbia University Center for Resilient Cities and 
Landscapes hosted a 3-day Resilience Accelerator workshop. Each participating 
jurisdiction selected a resilience project that faced a complex path towards 
implementation, such as aligning stakeholder and inter-agency interests or integrating 
engineering, land use, and public/private financing solutions. The objective was to 
improve the resilience value of each project while challenging the people and institutions 
delivering those projects to be more holistic, anticipatory, reflective, innovative, and 
radically action-oriented in their work. Each jurisdiction had an 8-10 member team with 
a mix of staff and outside experts. Each project team also had a facilitator and a visual 
facilitator to help guide the conversation and capture progress. The workshop began with 
an open session where the public and broader stakeholders were invited to learn about 
the projects and provide their input. Public, elected leaders, and key stakeholders were 
also invited at the end of the workshop to learn about the outcomes.

RESILIENCE ACCELERATOR – 
BRICKELL BAY DRIVE

The Brickell Bay Drive Accelerator was a 3-day workshop focused on the 
protection and adaptation of essential economic, natural, and human 
resources of the waterfront. Realizing the vulnerability to sea level rise, 
storm surge, and other challenges, the City of Miami selected the Brickell 
Bay Drive project as a demonstration project to incorporate more resilient 
design into waterfront standards. The scope of the project was increased 
through the 100RC Resilience Accelerator workshop held in August 2018. 

The waterfront design standards addressed included: 1) accessibility and 
livability, 2) environmental enhancement, 3) risk reduction, 4) economy 
and tourism and 5) history and culture. The goal of the project was to 
improve flood and surge protection while still providing water access, and to 
improve public greenspace and connectivity while encouraging multimodal 
transportation options. 

Key city departments and local and national experts participated and helped 
identify challenges as well as available resources. The project was made 
possible through the Brickell Adaptation Action Area, which allowed for 
more innovative design, and funding through the Miami Forever Bond. It was 
intended to serve as a model to update waterfront standards across the City 
and to provide an approach to public-private financing for construction and 
maintenance. 

RESILIENCE ACCELERATOR –

innovative engineering solutions, and stakeholder engagement.

The workshop focused on process and design based on current and future 
environmental challenges, while considering costs and benefits. Throughout 
the workshop the City of Miami Beach team tested and evaluated elements 
of the West Avenue Project to develop modifications that enhance the 
projects resilience and build community consensus, while remaining fiscally 
responsible. As a result, the team identified appropriate enhancements 
based on the project’s lifecycle, existing and future site challenges, and 
feedback from the local community.

RESILIENCE ACCELERATOR – 
SOUTH CORRIDOR TRANSIT 
HUBS 

The South Corridor Transit Hubs Resilience Accelerator was a 3-day 
workshop focused on developing concept design for a transportation 
hub along the south corridor of the Miami-Dade County SMART Plan. In 
conjunction with 100RC and Columbia University, the workshop focused on 
design guidelines for a proposed transportation hub pilot at the intersection 
of SW 211th Street and U.S. Highway 1. Experts who participated in the 
accelerator ranged from a specialist in transit-oriented design and planning 
to an expert in affordable housing and an expert in pedestrian networks and 
parks. As part of this workshop, four overarching goals for transportation 
hubs were established: Adapt to change, prepare and protect communities, 
enhance multi-modal sustainable mobility, and reduce disparities. The 
experts outlined a mix of policy, programming, and capital improvements 
that can be made to achieve those goals. Because of this workshop, design 
concepts for transit hubs and first/last mile connections between the SMART 
Plan corridors and the regional non-motorized trail system (SMART Trails 
Master Plan) were developed.

RESILIENCE ACCELERATOR – 
MILITARY TRAIL HOMES

Palm Beach County, a member of the Southeast Florida Climate Change 
Compact, was invited to participate in the Resilience Accelerator workshop 
as a way to extend the resources and benefits of this program to the greater 
southeast Florida Compact region. This Accelerator focused on developing 
resilient, dignified cottage homes to promote self-sufficiency and inspire 
future small-scale affordable housing to fulfill a vital need. The Military Trail 
Homes sit along an abandoned site on the SR 809 highway running through 
Palm Beach County. Key questions addressed during the accelerator were: 
(1) What innovative design solution can create a welcoming community for 
extremely low- and low-income people in a car-oriented commercial strip? 
And (2) How can this low-cost, small-footprint housing provide a model for 
developing other types of housing in the region? The accelerator began by 
identifying the top shocks and stressors that the future housing development 
needs to consider: an opioid epidemic, economic instability, extreme heat, 
mobility challenges, potential violence, and prioritizing housing for single 
mothers. The guiding principles developed and shared at the workshop 
included requests for proposals for a resilient traditional housing scheme.

DESCRIPTION
GM&B will work with Miami-Dade County to create a Resilient305 data-driven initiative 
on ArcGIS Hub. This cloud-based platform will be an opportunity to share open data, 
interact with users, and to provide progress updates on action items in the Resilient305 
Strategy with local governments and the community at large. GM&B municipalities will 
have the opportunity to request access to the latest resilience data and create their own 
initiatives, facilitating data sharing and improving intergovernmental collaboration. The 
ArcGIS Hub will also create an opportunity to help keep the general community updated 
on the progress of the Resilient305 Strategy. 

To help launch the Resilient305 actions, the GM&B team will create an advisory group of 
potential municipal representatives and community members to help set expectations for 
the initiative, inventory existing data, and advise creation of materials and data for the 
Resilient305 ArcGIS Hub.

Story maps are highly versatile tools that can be easily shared via social media and can be readily adapted to address any number of 
themes. Miami-Dade County has begun developing story maps to help visualize data and communicate various resilience challenges with 
the community. By collaborating with subject matter experts and GIS professionals, the County has been able to effectively demonstrate 
sea level rise as well as showcase what projects are underway to address the flooding. A second story map was developed to analyze 
both where to site transit stations and how stations could be reimagined to also serve as community resilience hubs, offering multiple 
public services and providing civic spaces. GM&B will continue to work with its partners to help tell its resilience stories using this new 
digital tool.

DESCRIPTION
GM&B is at the forefront of climate change innovation, especially related to flood 
management. The Urban Land Institute, in its examination of the City of Miami 
Beach’s stormwater program, commended the City for making a “courageous start to 
combat sunny day flooding...for its timely action, investment in physical infrastructure, 
identification of self-funding sources, and a decision to include sea-level rise and 
increased precipitation in planning.” To build on lessons learned and improve consistency 
across its GM&B municipalities, GM&B will spearhead implementation of a step-by-step 
approach to hydrodynamic computer modeling developed by AECOM; this action will 
involve all GM&B municipalities. Steps include inventorying current efforts and moving 
towards developing shared data; improving assumptions for sea level rise, rainfall, and 
groundwater; and compiling a library of modeling efforts. By working together with 
its GM&B municipalities, GM&B can make complex water modeling for infrastructure 
planning better, faster, and cheaper for GM&B municipalities through collaboration and 
enhanced tools. 

Flood management is incredibly complex and using integrated hydrodynamic computer 
modeling is an action that will benefit the entire GM&B region. GM&B municipalities 
can build on existing data and work completed, reducing duplication of efforts and 
saving time and money. Routine meetings to build knowledge and relationships are key 
to understanding how to use these data. This modeling effort will result in decreased 
modeling costs and faster construction of capital projects based on modeling outcomes. 
The products of this action will include a centralized data repository and a library of 
models to help understand scenarios, assumptions, limitations, boundary conditions, and 
when to use them. To kick off this action, GM&B will create a sample resolution with an 
interlocal agreement to be adopted by participating cities. This resolution should include 
a municipal commitment and funding model to move forward with this action.

DESCRIPTION
One of the goals for improving water resilience for GM&B is to move towards a “One 
Water” approach, which was detailed by the U.S. Water Alliance publication, One Water 
Roadmap: The Sustainable Management of Life’s Most Essential Resource, published 
in 2016. As one of five global cities selected by The Rockefeller Foundation to help 
develop the international City Water Resilience Approach, GM&B will use the City Water 
Resilience Approach to assess the resilience of its County-wide water supply and water 
infrastructure. The challenges and gaps to resilience will be identified and those results 
will be used to identify and develop indicators for a more resilient water supply and 
management system, improve interagency collaboration on water issues, and develop 
and implement a One Water Resilience Action Plan. 

The One Water framework states that “all water has value and should be managed in a 
sustainable, inclusive, and integrated way.” This is particularly true in southeast Florida, 
where, due to the porous limestone geology, hydrology, and climate of the region, water 
resources are intricately connected and highly managed to provide for water supply, 
flood protection, and other needs. The City Water Resilience Approach will also serve 
to improve collaboration and coordination on water issues, which meets the interests 
expressed by numerous stakeholders during the Resilient305 Strategy development 
phase.

RESILIENT UTILITY COALITION
The Resilient Utility Coalition (RUC) was created to advance utility infrastructure 
resilience efforts. Partners from public utilities, private industry, and academia are 
working together to operationalize policies/practices and build capacity among operators 
and partners in making our systems more resilient to hurricanes, infrastructure failure, 
increased precipitation, sea level rise, and saltwater intrusion. By operationalizing 
resilience through interdisciplinary and integrated planning, RUC is improving water 
quality, public health, and its use of resources with responsible investments. RUC was 
born in South Florida, inspired by the Southeast Florida Climate Compact, and nurtured 
by the 100RC network.

DESCRIPTION
Significant efficiencies and cost-savings can be achieved with better planning and 
coordination of capital projects. Miami-Dade County will spearhead an effort to improve 
intra- and inter-agency communication and coordination on planning and implementation 
of utility and other capital projects. This effort will build upon existing coordination of 
capital projects between the Miami-Dade Department of Transportation & Public Works 
(DTPW), the Miami-Dade Water & Sewer Department (MDWASD), and utility companies, 
as well as existing quarterly meetings of intra- and inter-agency utility and infrastructure 
staff. It will also take advantage of existing technology and software platforms, such as 
the iWASD open source GIS data hub, which reports on the status of construction and 
permitting projects. Initial steps will include broadening the scope and participation of 
the meetings and providing training and assistance on the iWASD platform to improve 
the use of this helpful data source. Miami-Dade County, led by MDWASD, is also 
implementing e-Builder, a role-based enterprise management tool that will assist County 
Departments in managing capital improvement and development project lifecycles 
and business processes. The e-Builder system will serve as a project control tracking 
system, integrated across departments for efficient and coordinated delivery of capital 
improvements. 

Additionally, Miami-Dade County has taken steps that can be used as a foundation to 
better coordinate and inform GM&B municipalities and other agencies. For example, a 
Utility Round Table was established in October of 2013 by the Miami-Dade Division of 
Environmental Resources Management (DERM) as an effective forum for information 
exchange among utilities, design professionals, and regulators to improve communication, 
coordination, and feedback between the County and stakeholders, and to provide 
updates on existing and proposed regulations, policies, and procedures. Multiple benefits 
can be gained through improved coordination on capital projects including reduced 
disruptions, increased efficiencies and economies of scale, and reduced violation of the 
County’s Pavement Moratorium.

SOUTHEAST FLORIDA CLIMATE CHANGE COMPACT 
Southeast Florida has a young but rich history in regional collaboration to tackle complex issues. In the fall of 2009, about 100 leaders 
in the region convened the first annual climate leadership summit. By early 2010 each county—Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade 
and Monroe—approved a simple yet powerful resolution committing to the Southeast Florida Climate Change Compact to work in 
earnest on climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. The Compact staff steering committee is composed of county and 
municipal partners, as well as the South Florida Water Management District and TNC. With support from the Kresge Foundation and 
the Institute for Sustainable Communities, the Compact has produced many important resources for local governments including the 
unified sea level rise projections, a regional greenhouse gas baseline, two regional climate action plans, annual legislative priorities, 
extensive training opportunities, and 10 annual summits (with attendance surpassing 700 in 2018 at the Miami Beach Convention 
Center). This model of regional collaboration has been the source of inspiration to many other regional collaboratives from as far away 
as Durban, South Africa, to as close as our friends in Central Florida and the Tampa Bay area.

DESCRIPTION
The success of a resilient budget depends on a diversified economy that reduces the 
impact of a financial shock, the flexibility to reallocate funds to critical projects that 
address shocks when needed, and allocation of funds that prioritize resilience objectives 
across departments. GM&B will identify and recommend funding in each entity’s budget 
towards the implementation of Resilient305 objectives that reflect these success factors. 
To augment this initiative, GM&B will create an online guide and reference materials 
for other governments and agencies who wish to incorporate and prioritize resilience 
objectives in their budgets and strategic plans.

Leading by example, Miami-Dade County continues to organize its multi-billion dollar 
budget around the four dimensions of 100RC’s City Resilience Framework: health and 
wellbeing, economy and society, infrastructure and environment, and leadership and 
strategy. The County’s current FY 2018–19 Budget and Multiple Year Capital Plan includes 
specific references to operating expenditures and capital projects targeted towards 
resilience efforts. In FY 2019–20, the County will further prioritize resilience objectives by 
restructuring its strategic plan around the Framework’s four dimensions and will establish 
a resilience accelerator program to support financing of resilience projects in the GM&B 
region.

The GM&B Resilient305 Strategy development phase gave the City of Miami Beach 
the opportunity to update its strategic plan through the lens of resilience. The City is 
increasing the resilience impact of capital projects through integrated planning and is 
also evolving traditional government services to plan for resilience shocks and stressors. 

Resilience and innovation are cross cutting themes in the City of Miami’s updated 
strategic plan, and priorities and actions identified during the GM&B Resilient305 
Strategy development phase will be integrated into that plan. The City’s 
interdepartmental Resilience Action Group is charged with implementing that strategy.

procuring municipal goods and services. GM&B will arm local purchasing managers with 
tools and training to modernize local government procurement to address shocks and 
stressors, thereby accelerating efforts in resilience building. Procurement officials will 
learn how to change language in city solicitations to ensure that consultants not only 
understand stressors, shocks, and climate vulnerabilities, but also know how to address 
these matters in the most innovative ways possible. 

Steps include creating a baseline inventory of resilient procurement policies throughout 
the cities within Miami-Dade County. A database of innovative procurements, tools, and 
practices will be created for GM&B municipalities to access. Recent creative examples 
from the City of Miami Beach include the development of design guidelines for historic 
properties in the face of sea level rise and an economic analysis of the stormwater 
program. Finally, a local platform for training opportunities will be created through the 
local National Institute of Government Purchasing (NGIP).

INNOVATIVE INSURANCE FOR 
TOURISM INCOME IN THE 
CITY OF MIAMI BEACH

The City of Miami Beach has actively examined parametric 
insurance as part of the 100RC network. Parametric 
insurance is a form of risk transfer, paying an agreed-
upon amount when a specific condition is met. This is 
an excellent exercise for city managers, risk managers, 
and chief financial officers in determining their best 
financial risk reduction method. Such innovative insurance 
mechanisms were also a feature of the Urban Land 
Institute Advisory Services Panel invited by the City of 
Miami Beach for a global and interdisciplinary analysis of 
the City’s stormwater program. As the leading revenue 
generator for GM&B and second in the State of Florida, 
tourism revenue is a key funding source and is governed 
by state statute. 

Tourism revenue is relatively volatile because it is 
vulnerable to sudden changes in economic conditions and 
other shocks. While this revenue is critical to the City, 
there is also a risk from any significant negative impacts 
to both the Resort Tax Fund and the General Fund. Over 
the last few years, the City’s tourism revenue has suffered 
from major events like Hurricanes Matthew and Irma, alarm 
over the Zika virus, the closing of the convention center 
during renovation, and economic recession. Given this 
variability, the City decided to seriously explore parametric 
insurance for its tourism revenue.

for many disciplines, from engineers and scientists to bankers and insurance companies. 
GM&B will lead (and learn from) all our cities as we define and communicate the 
benefits of resilience investments together. GM&B will share its approaches and lessons 
learned from a variety of studies and projects (such as those described in the following 
case study), including cost-benefit analyses in dollar terms, green infrastructure, and 
adaptation pathways. The more cities can work together to increase the understanding 
of resilience benefits for public and private property, the more we can help residents, 
businesses, elected officials, and the world be informed to make their own adaptation 
investment decisions. This action will also be part of Action 46: Resilient 35 in the 305 
Network, which builds relationships and resilience across municipal governments. GM&B 
will also share this information for dialogue and learning with its participating Chambers 
of Commerce.

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS 
OF RESILIENCE 
INVESTMENTS 

The City of Miami Beach’s ‘Business Case Analysis’ is a 
one-of-a-kind project that will examine both the risks 
from sea level rise and rainfall, and demonstrate how the 
stormwater program can reduce this risk. The study will 
demonstrate the costs and benefits of doing nothing, of 
public infrastructure investment, and of varying levels of 
private adaptation investment. This type of cost-benefit 
analysis is a unique process and requires a diverse team—
from scientists to flood insurance experts—to begin to 
understand the complexity of these separate but related 
issues.

Miami-Dade County is conducting a county-wide 
assessment of the feasibility of various measures that 
can protect the community from impacts of sea level rise. 
This assessment estimates the economic feasibility of the 
multiple adaptation pathways under consideration. 

Miami’s updated stormwater master plan includes a cost-
benefit analysis of all recommended capital improvements. 
Considerations include risk reduction to lives and property, 
as well as environmental, economic, and quality-of-life 
impacts. To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, the 
City recently partnered with its Downtown Development 
Authority to contract Impact Infrastructure, Inc. to conduct 
a model, triple bottom line (environmental, social, and 
economic) cost-benefit analysis on a hybrid living shoreline 
project in the Brickell Area.

Over the last three years, while Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami and the City of 
Miami Beach were developing this unified Strategy as Greater Miami & the Beaches, each 
entity has been busy developing and implementing comprehensive strategies and action 
plans to build resilience within their jurisdictions.  This includes integrating resilience 
into city and county-wide strategies, budgets, comprehensive plans, and emergency 
management plans; appointing resilience liaisons from key departments; developing and 
passing bonds to finance resilient infrastructure; passing policies and securing funds to 
accelerate the creation and preservation of affordable housing; improving and expanding 
mobility options; expanding economic opportunities and mitigating flood risks.  The 
unified Strategy development process informed and strengthened how we approached 
building resilience within our own jurisdictions. The Resilient305 Strategy will now 
become the overarching link of our planning efforts and the foundation for not only our 
individual strategies, actions, and investments, but also for the other municipalities, 
businesses, institutions and community organizations within Greater Miami & the 
Beaches. 

We recognize that implementing each of the actions within the Resilient305 Strategy 
will require dedicated effort from a team that we call PIVOT or Progress, Innovation, 
and Vision for Our Tomorrow. The PIVOT team will look at resources, timeframes, and 
priorities to develop a work plan and oversee implementation and strategy progress.

GREATER MIAMI & THE BEACHESIMPLEMENTATIONPIVOT TEAM

The initial PIVOT Team will be composed of a senior administrator and a CRO from each of the Greater Miami & the Beaches partners and a 
representative from The Miami Foundation. The CROs will continue to share management of the process and the appointed representatives will 
provide legislative and budget guidance for implementing the Strategy. The PIVOT team will ensure the region’s diversity is reflected in actions 
undertaken by GM&B. Actions in the Resilient305 Strategy will be supported initially by staff resources from each entity and participating 
organizations. 

As actions are undertaken, additional members from the community will be invited to join the PIVOT Team in support of the prioritized actions. 
The PIVOT Team will grow as additional GM&B municipalities and organizations join after they complete Action 45: Send your Boss to Boot Camp 
and designate a municipal CRO. Membership may also grow based on the stakeholders needed to help implement the Resilience Strategy actions. 
Committees will be formed over time, to address areas such as funding, communications, engagement for every action, legislative priorities, 
performance metrics, and equity.

amongst relevant partners and the community, and promote implementation of the Strategy county-wide. Specifically, they will assist in establishing 
shared measurement practices and building partners’ capacity to contribute and utilize resilience tools developed. This focused day to day work will 
help institutionalize resilience actions across municipalities and is essential to maintain public support and implement policy priorities. 

PIVOT ACTIONS

The PIVOT Team will meet monthly, and CROs will report back to their respective Commissions with updates. Within the first six months of the 
Resilient305 Strategy release, the initial PIVOT Team will prioritize the first wave of immediate actions. The Team will create a monthly schedule of 
meetings, an initial workplan, and a communications plan for implementing the actions. 

PIVOT BENEFITS

The PIVOT team will continue to share management of the process and the appointed representatives will provide legislative and budget guidance
